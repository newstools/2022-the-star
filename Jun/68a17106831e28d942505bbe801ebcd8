Kenya is among the countries listed to be experiencing the sixth wave of Covid-19 in Africa. However, tourism stakeholders at the Coast said that during the first Covid-19 outbreak, the sector learned a lot and the sixth wave might not affect them much. Former Tourism Federation chairman Mohammed Hersi said the sixth wave will not affect the business. “As tourism industry, we are used to the pandemic and we have always continued to follow the protocols we were given by the Ministry of Health, so the sixth wave will not have a negative impact,” he said. But Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Coast executive officer Sam Ikwaya said despite the country having a big population of those vaccinated the government should activate the Covid protocols. “Our main concern is politicians who are carrying out the rallies and crowds, this might be the biggest spreaders. Therefore we encourage people to observe the protocols and get vaccinated,” he said. For the past month, stakeholders at the Coast have been calling on the government to allow more scheduled and charter flights to the Moi International Airport. Kenya Coast Tourism chairman Victor Shitakha said every person coming into the country has always been asked to present their Covid-19 certificate. “We are now observing the Covid protocols for tourists coming to our country, therefore we expect things to continue as usual,” he said. He said so far inter-domestic tourism is doing well. Ikwaya said the sector is currently surviving on domestic tourism and conferences. “So far we are doing fairly well, our hotels are 70 per cent occupied. Mombasa is performing better compared to Malindi and Diani which are mostly for leisure tourism but the business is a bit low,” he said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
