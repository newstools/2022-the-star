Woods took to Twitter on June 7 to make the announcement. ESPN reports that the 46-year-old 15-time major champion also dropped out of last month's PGA Championship after playing 54 holes. He was reportedly limping on the leg he injured in the car crash he was in last year. He's since had surgery to repair the damage but is still recovering. The cold weather during last month's PGA Championship in Tulsa, Oklahoma, didn't seem to help. Woods reportedly complained about pain in his leg after every round of that event.
