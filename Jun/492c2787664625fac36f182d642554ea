Thunder coach Collins Gaya is eyeing his first win when they play two Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) matches at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. They take on former champions Ulinzi Warriors in a top-of-the-pick game on Saturday and play Africa Nazarene University (ANU) the following day. Thunder lost their season opener 76-69 to Strathmore University Blades but Gaya said he is prepared for the task ahead. "We will be fine against Ulinzi since we know how they play and at the same time, they are still adjusting to their new coach. We lost to Blades because we didn't do a good job on the rebounds. I am sure we will do better in this area this time round," Gaya said. Against the students, Gaya was categorical: "I haven't watched them play so we will need to do the necessary adjustments as the game goes on." The soldiers won their two opening matches and coach Bernard Mufutu is aware his team needs to show off progress. In Kisumu, Lady Bucks will be at home to Zetech Sparks while Lakeside will entertain the visiting Zetech University Titans. The students had mixed results last week with Sparks hitting Strathmore University 54-32 as Titans were felled by Africa Nazarene University. On Sunday, African Nazarene University (ANU) face off against former champions Equity Bank Hawks. The bankers are back from a successful tour of Malawi where they had gone for a series of friendly matches. Storms who lost 94-53 to Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in Mombasa, have a date with Jkuat "Lynx", 46-32 winners over Eldonets. An exciting lower-division fixture will be at Butere Girls High School where the schoolgirls welcome Western Delight.
