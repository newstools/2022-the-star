Kenyans were treated to a refreshing performance from a long list of artists booked for the event. Nairobi's signature music Gengetone was performed at its best by sensational artists  Mario TJ Kasela popularly known as Trio- Mrio, Iyani and Femi One. The three gave a thrilling performance of their musical collaboration that was infused in gengetone tune before President Uhuru Kenyatta, guests and thousands of Kenyans who were following the event. While waving Kenyan flags, the three burnt the dance floor in a captivating manner. This is not the first time Trio Mio has graced functions graced by key dignitaries. In February this year, for instance, Trio graced Jubilee Party’s National Delegates Covention which was attended by over 4000 members including President Uhuru. Last December, Trio-Mio also shined in ODM leader Raila Odinga's major event in Kasarani where he announced he will be vying for the presidency.
