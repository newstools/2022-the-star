Nairobi West Hospital has confirmed former Churchill Show comedian Akuku Danger is being held at their facility over pending bills. Speaking to the Star on Tuesday, Head of Communications and Marketing Vishal Sharma said the hospital cannot divulge more information about the patient for legal reasons. In apparent defence of their move to detain the comedian, Sharma said  the hospital also has bills to pay. “We have nurses and employees who need to be paid. In terms of assistance, Akuku danger was assisted when he came to the hospital. But we want to exercise the patient-hospital confidentiality until when we will offer an official statement on his detention,” he said. Akuku Danger is said to be held over Sh823,000 medical bills. Thespian Sandra Dacha said Akuku was discharged on Monday but the hospital decided to detain him until he pays the remaining balance. Akuku Danger was hospitalised two weeks ago over an unknown illness. However, he was born with sickle cell anaemia. "The hospital has refused to accept collateral so that Akuku danger can organise his finances from outside despite having their collateral from the January bill, which has a higher value than the total bill. Anyone willing to help in any way, please reach us," she said. Dacha made the revelations on Instagram on Tuesday as she appealed to willing  Kenyans to help the former Churchill Show comedian. Sandra said Akuku's medical insurance card has cleared part of his bill.
