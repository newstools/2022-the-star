Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed, has extended the mandate of Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Transition Committee for the next two months. The decision, effected through a Gazette notice dated June 17, is meant to avert a leadership crisis after the Retired Judge Aaron Ringera-led Transition Committee's tenure expired on June 14. “The Transition Committee shall hold office for a period of two months with effect from June 16, 2022 and shall be assisted in the execution of its mandate by the secretariat. All communication to the committee shall be addressed to the chairperson,” read the gazette notice in part. Retired General Maurice Oyugi assumes the mantle as the new chairman. Oyugi served as Ringera’s deputy prior to his appointment. Former Kenya Rugby Union chairman Mwangi Muthee has been picked to deputize Oyugi. Amina maintained the rest of the team that served on the previous committee and its secretariat. They include Ali Amour, Bobby Ogolla, former Harambee Starlets captain Neddy Atieno, Caesar Handa, Hassan Haji, Dr J.J Masiga, Michael Muchemi, Racheal Kamweru and Anthony Isayi. Journalist Linda Oguttu retains her role as head of the secretariat with Lorine Nerea and former Kenya Rugby player Edward Rombo as secretaries. Journalist Robin Toskin, coach Rishadi Shedu and Maxwell Wasike have also found their way back to the secretariat. The CS unveiled the Transition Committee on May 13, to take over from the Caretaker Committee she appointed after disbanding the Nick Mwendwa-led federation on November 11. The decision is bound to court controversy given it was only last Saturday that a group of stakeholders formed a 13-member committee to take charge of football activities at the expiry of the Transition Committee's term. The 13-member committee is led by FKF Murang’a Branch Chairman Robert Macharia and Nairobi East Branch Chairman Amos Otieno. Editing by Tony Mballa
