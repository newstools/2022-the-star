The county government of Murang'a hopes to boost its revenue after MCAs passed a law to automate collection. Since 2013, the county has never hit its targets with the manual system opening loopholes for loss of funds. Speaker Nduati Kariuki said the manual system made it possible for officials to pocket some of the revenue collected. “The County Revenue Collection and Management Act 2022 has however enabled the adoption of digital revenue collection technology that will help the county to collect more funds and meet its targets,” he said. “Technology makes it easy to track the revenue collected and hold the officers involved accountable.” The county government has only managed to collect an average of Sh580 million annually against a target of Sh1 billion. This amounts to about 58 per cent of the annual targets. In the 2013-2014 financial year, the county collected Sh400 million while in 2014-2015, the annual revenue collection rose to Sh562million. In 2015-2016 Sh617 million was collected, Sh506 million was collected in 2016-2017 and 2017-2018, and Sh454 million was collected. A total of Sh702 million was collected in 2018-2019 and Sh551 million was collected in 2019-2020. Nduati, on Friday, said the Commission of Revenue Allocation has raised concerns over the consistent failure by the county to collect sufficient revenue which he said prompted the county government to adopt the law. Two weeks ago, the assembly's Finance and Implementation Committee visited Rwanda on a benchmarking tour and identified the lack of a comprehensive legal framework as one of the main hindrances to adequate revenue collection. “The use of manual revenue collection system has continuously hindered the county administration from reaching its target but the modern system will ensure no revenue is lost,” he said. The county government, he said, has several policies that work parallel to each other, providing separate enforcement mechanisms which have, in turn, resulted in a multiplicity of levies. “Unfortunately, the amount of revenue collected has dwindled despite businesses and properties mushrooming in the recent years,” the speaker said. He said an earlier attempt by the county to automate the revenue collection system failed as there were no laws in place to support it. The law is expected to become operational within 90 days.
