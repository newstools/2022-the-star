Just like pinning posts on TikTok and Twitter, Instagram now lets you pin up to three posts or reels to the top of your profile. All you have to do is select a post or a reel you want to pin and then tap three dots at the top right corner of the post. Select pin to profile, you will see your post at the top left corner of your grid with a pin icon. Instagram had initially announced the test in April.
