ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru says Kenya Kwanza's running mate Rigathi Gachagua has been a blessing to the Azimio outfit. Mucheru argued that Gachagua is an asset to Azimio given that many of the blunders he makes in his speeches have presumably won Azimio more votes without much effort. Speaking during an interview at KTN News on Sunday, Mucheru said Gachagua's priorities were misplaced and he was ignoring important issues such as advocating for more roads and hospitals. "He is a friend of mine, we come from Nyeri. I can say he has been a great blessing to us in Azimio whenever he opens his mouth to speak. These ICT people, when you are telling them you are going to break up a (communications company) because big companies are bad, what kind of thinking is that," Mucheru said. Mucheru on a lighter note said that he was part of the 'Give Gachagua the mic' gang, saying whenever the MP speaks, it's a loss for DP William Ruto's camp. The CS discredited Gachagua's argument that big companies should be split so that power is handed to the people. "I know he probably doesn't believe it but he is saying it. Gachagua is promising the Nyeri people that his government will open a state lodge for rice, meat and soda but the residents want more roads and hospitals. He is a blessing to us," he said. Mucheru said every time Gachagua speaks, he attracts backlash from some quarters for making controversial statements, some of which touch on the very voters he is looking to win over. Mucheru also added that if Ruto is declared the President, they will accept. "We have fought a good fight and we are confident we will win, but if Ruto wins, we will accept because this is a democratic country," he said.
