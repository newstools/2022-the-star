An image alleged to be of Senator Johnson Sakaja's graduation is photoshopped. The fact-checker has established the image is not authentic as alleged by a section of Kenyans who widely shared it on social media. The image was photoshopped from one shared by Joecalih who published his on December 20, 2020, a search by Google lens has revealed. Joecalih is a Kenyan commercial photographer and digital artist whose work focuses on themes of portraiture in African culture and modern Fashion. The image belongs to one Victor Nzyoka who graduated with a Masters in Finance from the University of Nairobi. In the photoshopped image, Nzyoka's face has been replaced with that of Sakaja. The graduation booklet bearing Nyoka's name, university and course has been edited and replaced with writings showing "Teams University" only. Other details in the photo including the graduation gown, hood and background remained the same as that of Nzyoka in the photoshopped image.
