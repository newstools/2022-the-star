Lawyer Miguna Miguna has dismissed the plan by Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajckoyah to issue holidays to various religious groups if elected president in the August 9, polls. The vocal lawyer pointed out that Kenyans need work and not holidays and advised Wajackoyah to make 'sober' proposals. "Holidays? Come on, Omwami. Kenyans want and deserve water, unga, chakula, jobs, rule of law and dignity. Stop smoking and focus. Cheers!" Speaking during Kakamega campaigns on Sunday, Wajackoyah promised to have the Constitution reviewed, with emphasis on religious holidays. "Kipengele kile nitaambia wananchi waweke ya kwanza, ni kwamba Waisilaamu watakuwa na holiday yao siku ya ijumaa, Seventh day mtaendelea hivo hivo on Saturday, Wakristo wengine mtaendelea hivo on Sunday alafu mrasta atakuwa na holiday every day," he said. This is loosely translated to, "The first section of the constitution that I will ensure it is amended is:  Muslims will have their holiday on Friday, Seventh Day Adventists on Saturday, the rest of Christians will continue with Sundays then rastas nation will have holidays every day". Wajackoyah also condemned those who have been criticizing his marijuana legalization plan saying the plant has more positives than negatives. "Fifty kilos of bhang goes for Sh3.8 million. From August 9, we will plant marijuana in Mumias land and Webuye pan paper," he said. The Roots' leader added that Kenya will have a 24-hour open economy to help raise the living standards of Kenyans. He said employees will be paid every month on the 14th. Apart from the all-time open economy and bhang, Wajackoyah has promised to have the country invest in the anti-venom market by having snake farms.
