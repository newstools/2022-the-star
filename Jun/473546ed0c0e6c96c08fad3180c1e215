Kenya is on track to plant an additional seven millions trees as part of the Safari Rally greening legacy project in collaboration with local communities. World Rally Championship Safari Rally greening legacy head, Ivy Kaburu, said five million trees have been planted thus far and paid homage to various local communities for working closely with them to achieve the target. "Stakeholder engagement has been positive. We have seen the communities totally support the initiative. We remain committed to achieving our target of 19 million trees," Kaburu said. The project has so far roped in eight counties across the country including Kakamega, Nyamira, Migori, Kisii, Homabay, Bomet, Uasin Gishu, Nyeri and Kirinyaga. It is a brainchild of President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Federation of International Automobile president Jean Todt after the country was granted hosting rights for one leg of the WRC calendar after a 19-year hiatus. Kaburu revealed that local community involvement has guaranteed survival rates of above 90 per cent after the first year of planting, ensuring the sustainability of the project for many years to come. Kakamega Forest Heritage Foundation CEO George Murila described the project as a noble and timely idea that will aid efforts to increase forest cover in the region. "We will plant trees on 56.6 acres, we are envisaging planting 26,000 trees this year, we thank WRC Safari Rally for their immense support," Murila said. The two were speaking over the weekend at Ilooro in Kakamega Forest during a tree-planting exercise. The Western and Kisumu edition efforts were bolstered by Kenya Forest Service, KCB Bank Kenya Kisumu and Kakamega branches, Kakamega Forest Heritage Foundation, Kalro Kisumu among other partners.
