Livestock farmers in Meru will benefit from high-yielding breeds after the government allocated funds for the construction of the Marimba embryo plant. Livestock PS Harry Kimtai said the plant will increase the chances of calves survival and give farmers the opportunity to choose the sex of the calves they desire. The PS spoke during the Meru Dairy Farmers Cooperative Society seventh annual field day at Meru Agricultural Show Ground on Saturday. He said the ministry is also developing a policy requiring farmers to sign a contract with processors to curb theft. “Farmers have been losing money to unscrupulous processors, who refuse to pay for the milk supplied. The ministry will work on measures to ensure milk is properly traced from the farmer, processor, traders to the consumer,” Kimtai said. The PS said dairy farming is one of the key sectors in agriculture that contributes greatly to the country’s economy. “Milk safety regulation 2021 is one of the measures put in place to improve the quality of milk sold to our people,” he said. Kimtai further said the Jubilee government set a minimum price of milk per litre that has benefitted farmers, who sell at not less than Sh33 per liter. Meru Dairy Union chairman Simon Kiruja said Mount Kenya Milk is selling in more than 40 counties. He said its members produced 99 million litres of milk this financial year with an average of 300,000 litres per day. Kiruja thanked the national government for waiving the union’s Sh500 million debt, which has enhanced their productivity to Sh4.6 billion annually. Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi lauded the union for offering farmers a good price of Sh47 per liter of milk. He also said the technological strides in the dairy sector have given farmers an opportunity to hasten the breeding process by impregnating their cows with a specific gender. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
