Interior PS Karanja Kibicho has warned the public against voting for corrupt leaders. Kibicho in a video seen by the Star on Saturday said they will keep on discouraging the public from voting for corrupt leaders. "Hatujaambia wananchi yule mtu wanachagua, tunawaambia waangalie kama mtu akona certain characteristics, kama mtu akonazo msimchague," he said. This loosely translates to, "We have not told the public the person to choose, we have told them to look out for certain characteristics that if someone possesses, he should not be voted for". Kibicho said the known leaders who have been involved in theft and the characters he is talking about, have lashed out at him. "It's the same thing if I'm in a crowd and I say "You're a thief", and one of us gets jumpy. If you get jumpy and I have not named anyone in particular, we know you're a thief," he said. The PS said he will keep on warning the public adding that the leaders' reactions will expose them. This comes days after Kenya Kwanza's William Ruto wrote to DPP seeking prosecution against the PS and six others including Interior CS Fred Matiang'i, ICT CS Joe Mucheru and Agriculture CS Peter Munya, for engaging in politics while in office. Others included James Macharia of Transport and Infrastructure, Devolutions CS Eugene Wamalwa and Environment CS Keriako Tobiko. The Alliance claimed the officials are taking sides when they are supposed to be neutral. "The involvement of the Cabinet Secretaries and the Principal Secretary also raises doubt on their neutrality and it is a barefaced, unconcealed and blatant conflict of interest," UDA Secretary General Veronica Maina said.
