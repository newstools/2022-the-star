More than 150 golfers have been drawn to tee off in the 7th leg of the ongoing 2022 NCBA Golf Series at the ever-green par-72 Sigona Golf Club on Saturday. Participants will use the event at the 18-hole course to book places in the Grand Finale, where top finishers will win an all-expenses-paid trip to South Africa’s Fancourt Country Club. The event follows the sixth leg of the series played at the Great Rift Valley Golf last weekend, where home player, Steven Njoroge, clinched the Division One honours after carding a round of 34 points. In Division Two, handicap 27, Keval Maisuria, sealed the win after carding a round of 34 points, while Miriam Smith (H32)  carded33 points to claim the ladies’ category. The three became the latest addition to the list of golfers who will battle it out for the ultimate prize at the series’ Grand Finale that is set for Muthaiga Golf Club. NCBA Group managing director, John Gachora, said: “We had an amazing experience the last time we were at Sigona. The course was in good shape, and the hospitality of the club was also great. We are, therefore, delighted to be headed back to the golf course and it is our hope that we shall have another great outing,” said Gachora.
