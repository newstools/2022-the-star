Endebess subcounty commissioner Rashid Kwanya on Wednesday warned criminal gangs operating in Kitale’s informal settlements to ship out or be crushed. He said the government will not relent in its commitment to providing security to its citizens. "We will not hesitate to take decisive action against criminal gangs who terrorise our people. They either stop their games or we will deal with them accordingly," he said. The administrator said measures had been put in place to secure the informal settlements in an attempt to tame possible threats to residents in this electioneering campaign period. He spoke at the Kitale Youth Empowerment Centre. "I want to warn criminal gangs like the Bogi Mawe...that they will soon be crushed if they continue." Kwanya said Trans Nzoia county being the bread basket of Kenya, it must be safe for its citizens to help them remain productive. He urged members of public to cooperate with officers to enhance security in the area by sharing  vital information that would lead to the arrest of criminals. This, he said, will enhance efforts to fight emerging criminal gangs. "I am told that the criminal gangs are operating in the informal settlements of Tuwan, Mitume, Kisumu Ndogo and Kipsongok." The administrator asked those who had been selected to work in the Kazi Mtaani programme to take advantage of the extension to empower themselves economically. He added that the programme is not only geared to have youths earn a living, but also help them reduce crime. "This programme is good in that it engages and empowers youths to keep them off backstreets, where criminal activities occur." The commissioner said there are several other programmes such as the Youth Enterprise Development Fund that is aimed at helping young people access capital to start their own business.
