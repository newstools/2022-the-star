Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo and his running mate Wilberforce Kitiezo have been cleared by IEBC to defend their seats at the August polls. The duo will be seeking to retain the county leadership via the ODM party ticket. "I'm glad that the process took the shortest time and we have been cleared together with my candidate Wilberforce Kitiezo," Ottichilo said. The governor called on his opponents to uphold peace during the campaign period. "This country is ours and after elections we are going to be here as brothers and sisters," he said. Speaking at the IEBC offices at Chavakali High School soon after he was cleared, Otichilo also asked the electorate to elect sober leaders who will consider their plight after the August 9 General Election. Ottichilo was the last candidate to present papers before the electoral agency on Sunday. He said he is glad that his party presidential candidate Raila Odinga was given green light to vie for presidency. Earlier, IEBC declined to clear Sabatia MP Fred Agoi for the Vihiga governor contest saying his running mate, Vincent Mmaitsi, failed to resign from state office on time. Mmaitsi was until his resignation on May 10 serving as a member of County Public Service Board of Vihiga County. The IEBC election laws required state officers seeking elective positions in the August 9 election to resign by February 9, 2022. County Returning Officer Peter Tiyo said aspirants who are yet to appear before the commission for clearance have until Tuesday, June 7 to do so. "We have Kenneth Marende who has not submitted his documents, we also have Alfred Agoi who had issues with his running mate that needs to be rectified before the deadline," Tiyo said. Marende had declared interest in the gubernatorial race but has since gone cold after Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga promised to nominate him as the Senate speaker if he wins the August polls.
