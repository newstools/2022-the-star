Over 150 golfers converge at the Par-71 Great Rift Valley Golf Course for the sixth leg of the 2022 NCBA Golf Series. This will be the second outing of the series at the club, having made its debut last year when home player Steven Njoroge claimed the title with a round of 39 points. This weekend’s leg coincides with the opening of a new NCBA branch in Naivasha Town. The top five finishers from the event will join 20 others from Kenya Railway, Nyanza, Kitale, and Nakuru Golf Clubs in booking their tickets to play at the series Grand Finale later this year. The winning team at the Grand Finale will win an all-expenses-paid trip to South Africa’s Fancourt Country Club. So far, 15 senior golfers and four junior players from the previous four tournaments—which have been held in Kenya— have booked their slots to play at the Grand Finale at the Muthaiga in December this year. This year’s series will feature 18-legs across Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Similar to the 2021 edition, this year’s series will feature three junior golf tournaments – which will be held across East Africa - in partnership with U.S. Kids Golf. The first of the junior events was held during the Easter Weekend at the Lake Victoria Serena Golf Resort in Uganda, while the other two are scheduled for Karen Country Club in July and Muhthaiga in December. NCBA Group managing director John Gachora said they are pleased to be going back to Great Rift Valley Lodge this year after the success of last year's event at the same venue. "We are looking forward to taking on the challenge of the 18-hole’s tight fairways, and it is my belief that all players will have an excellent time on the course. I am delighted that the Series is taking place on the back of our new branch opening in Naivasha," he said
