Sprinter Mike Mokamba says their 4x400m victory at the recently concluded Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Mauritius has lifted the team`s spirit and psyched them up to go for new challenges. " This was my first gold at the African Championships and it makes me feel good. The presence of Ferdinard Omanyala, the fastest 100 metres man in Africa, on the team is a morale booster and we feel stronger than before," Mokamba said. The Poland World Relays silver medalist said their priority right now is to qualify for the World Championships and the Commonwealth Games. "We are going back to camp at Moi Stadium, Kasarani to train thoroughly as we await the trials for the World Championships and Commonwealth Games," he said. The trials for the World Championships and Commonwealth Games are scheduled for later this week at  Moi, Kasarani. Mokamba reckoned that the country has the potential to win sprints but only if the young athletes can stay focused and work hard. "You have to be hard working and consistent in training. You also have to stay focused," he added. Mokamba expressed excitement and gratitude for being part of the Kenyan contingent at the Africa show and thanked his teammates for helping him realize his dream. He also credited the team's achievement to hard work and self-belief. The relay team comprised Mokamba, Ferdinand Omanyala, Dan Kiviasi and Samuel Imeta.
