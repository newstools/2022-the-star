Thousands of motorsport enthusiasts thronged Naivasha and its surroundings to get a glimpse of the high adrenaline action between man and machine The rally lived up to its billing as the toughest on the WRC calendar, with treacherous conditions in the four-day extravaganza. The rally has been a godsend to the economy of Nakuru in terms of revenue generation. The rally organisers should consider expanding it to other counties, such as Narok, Kajiado, Kisumu or Mombasa, for fans to get a glimpse of the action. Back in the good old days of the 1980s and 1990s, the rally traversed the major cities of the country capturing the heart and soul of thousands of fans. We would like to commend the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting the rally, which in return has seen the world governing body FIA extend it for a further three years to 2026 on the WRC calendar. This will be a big boost to the motorist fraternity. The Ministry of Sports has played a leading role in ensuring that rally is well supported and funded leaving nothing to chance for participants, drivers and those involved in the running of the sport.
