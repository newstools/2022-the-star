Western Jaguars have received a timely boost after signing a Sh1m sponsorship deal with Down To Earth Technologies Limited. Speaking during the cheque presentation at the City Park Stadium on Saturday coach Mike Malungu said the cash injection will motivate the team as they battle for honours in the ongoing Kenya Hockey Union League. Jaguars have found the going tough, raking in just four points in as many matches to sit ninth in the 10-team league. "DTE have given us playing kits, hockey sticks protective gear and scholarship opportunities for the players," said Malungu. "This will motivate the team since the sponsorship runs for three years. The target is to improve the results and become a competitive outfit." He added: "The League is currently competitive. Unlike in the previous seasons where it used to be a two-horse race, this season is totally different. Teams have come off age and there's growth." "Despite our current position, we still have our eyes on the title. We want to find our footing in the remaining five first leg matches to have a realistic chance of giving a shot at the gong." Jaguars  have been relying on support from communities based in western Kenya since the team's inception in in 2005. DTE managing director Vincent Milewa said they were pleased to be part of the team and promised more support to the team captained by Ivan Ludiali. “This is a project that we hope will help the team win the league in three year's time. But for now, there's no pressure. Let the players express themselves and develop their game," said Milewa.
