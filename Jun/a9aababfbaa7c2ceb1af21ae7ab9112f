Mental health issues have been attributed to the increase in suicide cases among teachers, a teachers lobby has said. The Kenya Women Teachers Association CEO Benta Opande said recent research shows more than 22 teachers have died from suicide in the past two years alone. She said the trend could escalate to more teachers losing their lives if left unchecked. Opande spoke on Saturday during a mental health awareness meeting for teachers in Kisumu. “There is a real problem with teachers mental health. A lot of teachers are depressed, even the heads of institutions are under a lot of pressure,” she said. The CEO said there is need for mental wellness awareness to be enhanced among teachers, to address the menace. "We are also engaging women teachers on mental wellness. It has been discovered that teachers undergo real mental health issues," she said. Opande said KEWOTA in collaboration with other partners plans will roll out supporting sports activities in counties to help teachers overcome mental health issues. “Two months ago, we announced plans to start sports for teachers across the counties. We want them to go through their normal duty in an environment that they can express themselves,” she said. The CEO said the planned sports activities will go up to the national level. She was accompanied by the association national chairperson Dorothy Muthoni and treasurer Jesinta Ndegwa. The organisation also met teachers of special needs children and educated them on issues of women empowerment. They also educated teachers on digital content and urged more teachers to join the association. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
