The National Police Service on Tuesday warned against taking children to political rallies. The Service took to Twitter saying political rallies are emotive and risky spaces for minors. "Political rallies NOT safe for kids! It's putting little ones in harms way," NPS said. This comes days after the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) called upon politicians and parents to restrict children from appearing at the rallies. UNICEF Kenyan Representative Claudes Kamenga said being in the rallies is a way of exposing children to violence, drug abuse and accidents. Kamenga further asked all parties involved in politics; politicians, electorates and any other organizations, to ensure they uphold the rights of children. "Children have the right of protection from manipulation, exploitation and abuse, the right to privacy, the right to education which could be at stake if a child misses or drops out of school to participate in campaigns," Kamenga said. In May, in an interview with Ghetto Radio, Kibera Community Peace and Security Committee chairperson  Humphrey Lando urged parents in the area to be alert of their children's whereabouts so they do not end up in political rallies or gangs. He said there were rogue aspirants using kids from the area to add to their crowd number. Lando said his team was on the lookout to arrest any minors in campaign spaces and committing violence.
