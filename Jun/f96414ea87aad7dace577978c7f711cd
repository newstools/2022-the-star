Kenya Kwanza leaders have promised to prioritise the economic revival once they're elected the next government in the August 9 general elections. Led by their deputy presidential candidate Rigathi Gachagua, the leaders said they'll initiate a minimum return to every agricultural produce something which will favour Kenyans, majority of whom are farmers. "Our government will ensure we initiate minimum returns to all the agricultural products to ensure the farmers benefit. We want to create an environment where farmers will be able to plan for their money," the Mathira MP said. He said the idea of the minimum return will empower farmers to acquire the necessary wealth that most of the Mt Kenya region residents have for long been seeking. Speaking during Kenya Kwanza campaigns in Tharaka Nithi and Embu counties on Thursday, Gachagua who was accompanied by other politicians said once voted in,  the Kenya Kwanza government will lower the cost of foodstuff within the first 60 days. "I have good news for the people of Mt Kenya, once you vote us in to form the next government we'll ensure we reduce the cost of foodstuff." He added that once elected the government will provide a Sh50 billion kitty for small business owners to acquire loans to boost the economy. Among the leaders who accompanied Gachagua included Embu gubernatorial aspirant Cecily Mbarire, Kiambaa MP Ndidi Nyoro, Starehe MP Charles Njagua, Runyenjes MP Erick Muchangi among others. Gachagua warned Embu gubernatorial aspirant under Mbus party Lenny Kivuti against campaigning for Azimio la Umoja Presidential candidate Raila Odinga. He said this is disrespect to the people of Embu since they have very little benefit from the Jubilee regime which is under Azimio la Umoja. Nyoro  said the Inua Jamii programme will be given first priority over MPs' salaries.
