A Kirinyaga man suspected of killing his mother was on Wednesday morning arraigned in a Wang’uru court. Ephantus Kiura Ndambiri, 47, allegedly killed his 76-year-old mother Grace Muthoni two weeks ago in Kiarigi, Mwea East, and went into hiding. Ndambiri did not take a plea after police filed an application for more time to complete their investigations. Principal magistrate Miriam Mugure allowed the request and directed the suspect to be remanded at Wang’uru police station for five days. Area police boss Daniel Kitavi told the Star on the phone that the suspect was arrested on Tuesday evening inside a house under construction in Mbeere North, Embu county. A relative who helped in identifying the suspect told journalists that he received a phone call from a friend residing in Mbeere who informed him of the suspect’s whereabouts. “My friend told us he had spotted him inside an unfinished house where he was lying on a mattress while chewing miraa. By the side of his mattress was a Bible.” Edited by A.N
