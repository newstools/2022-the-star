Cucumbers should be stored at room temperature and not in the refrigerator. This is according to a post at Root Simple. Root Simple cites the University of California research, Davis, which determined that cucumbers are sensitive to temperatures below 50°F/ 10 degrees. When stored at room temperature, cucumbers thrive and last longer. Stored below 10 degrees, they are prone to developing “chilling injuries,” including water-soaked areas, pitting, and accelerated decay. Pitting and soaking is attributed to their high water content. It is believed that this is one of the reasons that studies have shown cucumbers stay fresher longer when stored at room temperature. But if you absolutely insist on chilling your cucumbers, limit it to no more than three days and eat them as soon as possible. Experts also suggest keeping them towards the front of the shelf, where temperatures are warmer, and off the bottom shelf, which is usually the coldest part of the fridge. Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants are also damaged by cold, so keep these on your counter as well. One more thing to keep in mind is that cucumbers are highly sensitive to ethylene, a natural gas that causes certain foods to ripen (and eventually spoil) very quickly. Be sure to keep them separately from bananas, tomatoes, and melons, which are all high ethylene producers.
