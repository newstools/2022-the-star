The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Tuesday declined to clear Loima MP Jeremiah Lomurkai, to vie for the Turkana governor seat. MP Lomurkai is eying the top seat on the ODM party ticket to succeed Governor Josphat Nanok. The IEBC has cleared three gubernatorial candidates including MP John Lodepe(UDA), former CS for petroleum and Mining John Munyes (Jubilee) and Joseph Atol ( Badiliko Party). Turkana County Returning Officer Amos Obonyo said they have been clearing and registering candidates for the August 2022 general election. "We have cleared nine candidates for the Senate position, five women reps and three Governors except for one Aspirant because of the few details," he said. He said Governor Aspirant has a case pending in court concerning his degree certificate and the case is yet to be determined. He said once the court determines the case they will be advised accordingly. "The gazetted time for clearance runs from date 9th May to 7th June, however, the court can order anything to be done beyond time," he said.
