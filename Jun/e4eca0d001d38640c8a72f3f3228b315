The University of Nairobi on Friday termed as fake a certificate bearing  Deputy President William Ruto's name that was doing rounds on social media. The viral photo got Kenyans wondering whether Ruto is caught up in the academic credential forgery that has marred the 2022 politics. However, speaking to a local media house, the University assured that the UDA presidential candidate is indeed an alumnus of the university. UoN also said the certificate posted is not the paper that they awarded Ruto. The fake certificate shows that Ruto William Kipchirchir graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree (Botany), Second Class Honours (Lower Division). According to the University graduation booklet of 1990, Ruto Kipchirchir William was awarded a Second Class Honours (Upper Division) in Science (Botany). His name appears in the booklet as number 130 of the class of October 1990 Bachelor of Science Degree under the school of Botany and Zoology. Ruto attended Kerotet Primary School before joining Wareng Secondary School for his O level. He went to Kapsabet Boys High School for his A levels. The Kenya Kwanza leader graduated in 2011 with a Masters of Science degree in Plant Ecology. He enrolled for a PhD in 2012, graduating on December 21, 2018, from UoN.
