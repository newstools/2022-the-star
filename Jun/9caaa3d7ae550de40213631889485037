Eastern regional commissioner Evans Achoki has faulted River Enziu bridge contractor for being slow. He said the agreement was that the contractor re-plans his work and starts putting up visible structures in the next three months. Achoki spoke on Friday when he led the Eastern region development and coordination committee to tour several state projects in Kitui county. Construction of the Sh600 million Enziu bridge started three months ago. Last December, a school bus plunged into the seasonal river killing more than 30 passengers. The commissioner also said the Nguni -Nuu road has since stalled 10 kms before Nuu market. He however said he will follow up with payments in order to complete the road. "There are pending certificates that have not been cleared, which I will follow up," Achoki said. The commissioner further cautioned drivers against overspeed saying this contributes to most accidents along the Thika -Garissa road at Kanyonyoo area. He also said the absence of any formal agreement between camel herders and farmers, will lead to the removal of camels in Kitui county. "Herders must take care of their camels and if not, they will be pushed out," Achoki said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
