Kenya Commercial Bank technical director Paul Bitok is over the moon after leading the team to the Africa Volleyball Club Championship title after a 15-year drought. Bitok, who led the team that won the tournament in 2006 expressed his delight following the team’s heroics thus far. “It is unbelievable, to be honest. It has been about 15 years since we last won a continental trophy. I am proud of this group of ladies. We utilised the Covid-19 period to adequately prepare for this tournament and today, we have reaped the fruits of our hard work,” said Bitok. The star-studded squad only lost one match on their way to the final with Carthage the only side who beat them in the group stages. The win puts Kenya on the continental map as a giant in volleyball thus breaking North American sides’ dominance that has lasted for years. The last time a Kenyan team reached the finals was in 2015 when Pipeline lost 3-1 to Al Ahly in Cairo. However, Kenya Prisons, who finished fifth this year, are the last Kenyan team to win the title in 2013. Head Coach Japeth Munala was full of praise for the Lionesses who he said deserve the trophy if their performance in the recent past is anything to go by. “I am grateful to God, KCB, and this team for the amazing experience here in Tunisia. We came here knowing the quality of our opponents and we did not take any side for granted. We have been solid throughout the tournament and the girls have been exceptional. They deserve it,” he said. He said the bank has invested heavily in the squad and the win did not come as a surprise. KCB beat Al Ahly 3-1 in the final to lift the trophy in Belkebia, Tunisia. The bankers, who have been perennial participants in the annual continental event have been in an imperious form since the beginning of the tournament and beat the Egyptians by sets of (25-18, 25-22, 11-25, 28-26).
