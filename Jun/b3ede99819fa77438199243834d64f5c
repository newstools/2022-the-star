A four year old boy is admitted at a city hospital after being defiled by his mother’s lover. Her mother Irene Nduku 30, was arrested alongside her lover Samuel Agesa, 32 on Thursday. Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti said the incident was reported to the police by the Child's teacher. "The teacher had noticed that the pupil was in severe pain after recounting what happened," Kinoti said. The child recounted how Agesa who is a boda boda rider, defiled him after beating him up whenever his mother was away. Nduku and Agesa are currently in custody at Parklands police station and are expected in court later today. Last month, the Ministry of Health reported that at least 9,484 children were defiled last year, with many infected with sexually-transmitted diseases including HIV. The children were aged 12 to 17 years, according to data entered in the Kenya Health Management Information System, which captures visits to all public health facilities. "Of this, only 43 per cent presented themselves at a health facility within 72 hours," the report read. Sexual abuse cases should be reported within 72 hours for the victim to receive medicines to prevent pregnancies and prevent infection of HIV/AIDS or STIs. It also helps medics collect evidence to be used against the perpetrators.
