World Under 20 10,000m race walker Margaret Gati will be among juniors in action at this Saturday’s Central Rift World Under 20 regional trials at the Eliud Kipchoge Sports Complex. Gati, a probable for August's World Under 20 Championships in Cali, Colombia, said she will be using the event as part of her preparations for the biennial event. “I want to run well in Kenya with hopes of clinching a world medal in Colombia. With this race walk career, I will go far and am giving myself self-esteem with hopes of making it to Colombia,” the Form three student at Cheptonon secondary school said. A beneficiary of Athletics Kenya's under 20 camp at  Kapkoimur, Nandi county, Gati failed to win a medal at last year’s World under 20 Championships at Kasarani Stadium, finishing eighth. The 18-year-old is looking up to fellow race walkers, Emily Ngii and Dominic Ndigiti, for inspiration in her quest for glory. Representing Nandi County, Gati will be up against other athletes from her home county, Uasin Gishu,  and Baringo, which make up the Central Rift region. The trials for the North Rift region, which comprises Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia, Turkana, West Pokot and Samburu will be held on the same weekend at the Ndura Sports Complex in Kitale, Trans Nzoia County.
