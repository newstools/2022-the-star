A Form 4 student and a Standard 7 pupil have died by suicide in one week in Mwingi. Mwingi Central subcounty police commander Peter Mutuma confirmed the two incidents. Mutuma said the high school student at Kyanika Secondary School hanged himself on a tree using a sisal rope at his father's farm in Kathonzweni on Saturday. Samuel Kyalo, the father, said his son had just been transferred from Mbondoni Secondary School to Kyanika. However, Kyalo revealed that his son had refused to go to school for two weeks without any reason. He said they found a suicide note in his bedroom that reads: "Learning is nonsense, my parents, neighbours and the government should take my body to school if they still want me to study." Mutuma said the body has been moved to Mwingi Level 4 hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Elsewhere a Standard 7 pupil at Kwa Musya Primary School hanged herself in Kyethani area. Her body was discovered by Pauline Muusi, her mother. Muusi said her 12-year-old daughter had refused school and after she forced her to go back, she took her life. Her body was moved to Mwingi Level 4 hospital mortuary. Mutuma said parents must talk to their children to understand them better and enable them to have the confidence to freely air their views. ‘The young people also need a lot of counselling and be allowed to freely air their opinions," he said.
