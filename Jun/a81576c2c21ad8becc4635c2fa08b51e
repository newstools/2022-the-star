Meta has rolled out a new tab ‘Calls’ tab that will help users track their call logs on both Android and iOS. The tab will be located between the Chats and Peoples tab on the lower bar on the app's screen. Facebook’s Messenger says that audio and video calling has grown at a rapid rate, with over 40 per cent more daily callers in the app now compared to early 2020. Globally, the application has seen more than 300 million audio and video calls being conducted every day. Messenger says the new call button will be a convenient option because previously, users had to open up a separate thread in order to call a friend or a family member.
