Any hopes Bandari had left of laying claim to a maiden Kenyan Premier League title this season went up in flames following their 1-0 defeat to Sofapaka at Mbaraki Grounds in Mombasa on Saturday. Stephen Okola's 48th-minute header was all Sofapaka needed to stun the dockers at home. The setback leaves the coach Anthony Kimani tutored side with 54 points, three adrift of leaders Tusker and Kakamega Homeboyz who have 57 points each, with the brewers enjoying a healthier goal difference.
