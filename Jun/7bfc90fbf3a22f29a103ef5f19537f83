Director of Public Prosecution Nordin Hajji wants the court to cancel bond terms issued to a house help and other suspects in Sh104 million theft case. The prosecution told the Kibera law courts on Friday that the accused persons will abscond court if the bond is not cancelled. The court had initially released them on a bond of Sh7 million, which was later reviewed to Sh1 million. The court heard that Shelmith Kiprono alias Jerop, who was arrested in Eldoret, was allegedly found with some money and other items believed to have been bought using the stolen money. According to the charge sheet, Kiprono committed the offense alongside Caleb Rasto, Kenneth Agaziva, Eunice Akinyi Moi and Jackline Minayo. Rasto, Agaziva and Moi who were charged earlier, were released on the same bond terms. The complainant's lawyer Danston Omari had earlier told the court that the accused persons were a flight risk and urged the court to cancel the bond. According to the prosecution, Kiprono led detectives to her hide-out in Kabarnet, where she had rented a house. “After a search, cash amounting to Sh372,000, USD 20,200 (2,364,410.01), assorted electronics and household goods including purchase receipts were recovered," the court was told. Kibera senior principal magistrate Electina Rian directed that the matter be mentioned on June 22, for a ruling. The magistrate also issued a warrant of arrest against Rasto after he again failed to appear in court. His lawyer Mukundi Gitau said the accused person was unwell and urged the court not to issue the warrant. Gitau also submitted an application opposing the DPP’s request of cancelling the accused person’s bond, saying it is their constitutional right. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
