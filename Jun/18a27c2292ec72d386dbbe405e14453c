National team Harambe Stars have moved up two places to 102 in the latest Fifa rankings. The rankings, released on June 23, saw Kenya move two spots up despite not playing since November 2021 due to Fifa suspension imposed on the country. Kenya’s improved performance against neighbouring countries like Uganda and Rwanda in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers back in November 2021 is responsible for propelling the Stars up. Kenya registered a  1-1 draw with Uganda in Kampala followed by a 2-1 strategic win over Rwanda in Nairobi. In East Africa, Uganda leads in the rankings at position 82 while in Africa, Senegal are top with the West African Country placed 20th followed by Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Belgium remains the top country for the fourth consecutive year followed by 2002 World Cup winners Brazil and 2018 World Cup winners France. Canada is the year's most improved country with a 130.32 point gain at position 40 while this year's Fifa World Cup hosts Qatar are in the top 50.
