A DCI officer whose body was found in his house in Amagoro town suffered cardiac arrest, a postmortem has revealed. Corporal Humphrey Murithi’s body was found on Tuesday morning by  colleagues who had unsuccessfully tried reaching him after he failed to report for work. A postmortem conducted on Thursday afternoon revealed the officer, who had served in Teso North for two years, suffered a cardiac arrest. The officer will be laid to rest on June 10 at his Chuka home in Meru, colleagues at the DCI said on Thursday. Teso North subcounty police commander David Muange on Tuesday told the Star that after Murithi failed to report to work, his colleagues drove to his official residence next to Amagoro Primary School to find out what was happening. “The house was locked from inside. We had to cut the door to gain access to the house only to find him on the bed dead,” he said. Colleagues described Murithi as a soft-spoken man. The family had earlier on objected to the proposal that a postmortem be conducted on the officer’s body. But the DCI intervened and explained the importance of the exercise.
