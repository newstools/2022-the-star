A campaign billboard affiliated with the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance has been vandalised by unknown people in Bomet. The billboards displaying the portraits of Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua were mounted early Thursday morning and vandalised the same day. Bomet Central sub-county police Musa Imamai said the billboard had actually been defaced but noted the matter was yet to be reported. "We are just observing like anyone else," he told the Star on phone. Imamai, however, said that once the report has been made, they will commence investigations with a view to bringing to book those who may have been involved. He also appealed to anyone who might be having information about those who damaged it to report to his office. The police boss further called on the residents to exercise restraint, saying they do not encourage such actions that amount to malicious damage to property. The incident happens in the wake of reports that a similar campaign billboard with Deputy President William Ruto's portrait was also vandalised in Kisumu. The vandalism acts had been condemned as an example of political intolerance ahead of the August polls. Imamai also said Presidential candidates and political parties have put up billboards all over the country, and there is no need to pull them down or vandalize them for whatever reason.
