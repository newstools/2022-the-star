Azimio la Umoja - One Kenya Alliance presidential team has hit out at Deputy President William Ruto for selectively taking credit for the successes the Jubilee regime has achieved. The duo stated that Ruto should take responsibility for both success and failures of the government. Martha Karua who is Raila Odinga’s running mate claimed that the second in command is dishonest when he criticises Jubilee for its failures but takes credit for its success. “You can’t choose which part of the government to claim credit for and which to disown. If somebody is standing at the podium, and telling people that ‘I’ve influenced this to happen in government’ they must also take the blame for its shortcoming – and that is the way it is,” she stated. She was speaking on  Tuesday night during a joint interview with Raila. Echoing her statements, Raila told off the DP for faulting the government which he serves, after his fall out with his boss the President, despite him refusing to resign. “It is unfair, really, to blanket-blame the government by somebody who is earning a salary; has got an over 250-man security detail; who is using government vehicles and equipment to do campaigns, to come out and say he is not in government,” he stated. Raila noted that Ruto should have resigned when he claimed he was kicked out of the government. “The decent thing that most responsible people do is resign. That is what Bildad Kaggia and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga did. You can’t blame the same government while earning a salary from it. If that is not hypocrisy, I do not know what is." Ruto has emerged as the fiercest critic of a government he played a key role in its formation only four years ago. An opinion poll released by TIFA in December indicated that most Kenyans now believe that Ruto is the leading voice against the Jubilee government, even though he had a hand in the appointment of a number of those occupying various top positions.
