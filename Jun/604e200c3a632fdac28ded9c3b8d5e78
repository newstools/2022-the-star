In last week’s incident, a police report shows that a KK security guard on duty, Tobias Juma, opened the main door of the bank for five robbers at the Nakuru branch located at the Westside Mall along Kenyatta Avenue After entering the banking hall, they then commandeered the members of staff to the toilets and locked them inside before they ransacked the drawers and stole the cash. “The robbers, armed with a homemade gun, hammer, knives, and a panga, forced their way into the banking hall where they held nine employees, hostage, before making away with the cash,’’ police said. Police recovered one homemade gun, a hammer, a Huawei mobile phone and an Sh1,000 note from the scene. The security on duty during the 4.30 pm incident has since been arrested in Bumula, Bungoma County and is assisting the police with the investigation.
