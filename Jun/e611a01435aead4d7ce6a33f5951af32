The Nakuru Agricultural Society of Kenya show returns from June 29 to July 3 after a two-year break caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Fifty-eight exhibitors have confirmed participation and are already on the ground and 120 others have shown interest, chairman Perminus Migwi said. The target is 200 exhibitors, he said. The theme for this year’s show is 'Promotion of Innovation and Technology in Agriculture and Trade', as in the past five years because the issue is pressing. Crops such as maize, wheat, millet, pyrethrum and many varieties of vegetables are ready for exhibition. Migwi said management will strictly adhere to Covid-19 protocols. Masks will be required in closed areas. Cases are increasing in what is believed to be the sixth wave in Kenya. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to officially open the show on July 1. Guests will include Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui and Senator Susan Kihika on separate days. Stands are being refurbished and preparations are well underway. Management has held two major events, the first on June 10 when requirements regarding payments, security and electricity were spelled out to exhibitors. More than 22 new exhibitors include the Umash Funeral Home that has many services, including packages whereby people can plan their final send-offs. Migwi said the other event was 10km walk through Nakuru city to the showgrounds, meant to create awareness. “The management incorporated its Corporate Social Responsibility event by feeding street families and contributing foodstuff to several children's homes, he said.
