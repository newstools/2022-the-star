The government has urged the youth to use the money they will get in phase III Kazi Mtaani programme to start income generating activities. Kirinyaga county commissioner Moses Ivuto said on Tuesday the programme will help keep the young people busy so they will not be used to cause violence during the electioneering period. “This is the right time to engage the youth as we move forward because they constitute a large number of our population. We want the youth to actively participate in promoting peace during the campaigns and the election period,” he said. The administrator said 8,666 youth from the county will get the opportunity to serve their communities, with each working 10 days a month until the programme ends. Ivuto was speaking in Kerugoya stadium during the launch of the third phase of the programme. Each youth will earn an average of Sh500 per day. “This programme is way too beneficial and productive and you should take it very seriously. The amount you are making cannot be compared with the little that is given to you by politicians. Some of you are given as little as Sh100 after following a politician the whole day,” he said. Ivuto told the youth not to allow politics to divide them. "Do not fight your neighbour because she or he holds a different political view or belongs to an opposing political party. This is a temporary season that will fade away in a matter of months. We all need each other after the polls, so let this season not divide us,” he said. Kirinyaga Central deputy county commissioner Daniel Ndege urged the youths to take the initiative seriously and use the funds from the programme to start their own businesses. “This should be one of the sources for your capital in case you want to be an entrepreneur. Work and save a substantial amount of money so that it may be enough to help you open your business,” he said. Edited by A.N
