Bungoma County Senator Moses Wetangula on Friday weighed in on the decision by the US Supreme Court to strike down a law legalizing abortion. Wetangula praised the ruling saying it is a restoration of dignity and respect for human life. "The Supreme Court in the US has finally overturned the 1973 decision of "Roe v Wade" on the right to life!! This is a judicial milestone that restores the dignity and respect for human life including that of the defenceless unborn child," he tweeted. The Roe v Wade law was a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court ruled that the US Constitution protected a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. The Court's judgement comes weeks after a leaked document showed it favoured the strike down. Hours after the decision, half of the US states are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans "Thirteen have already passed so-called trigger laws that will automatically outlaw abortion following the Supreme Court's ruling," BBC reported adding that others are likely to pass new restrictions quickly. The case that led to the recent ban was "Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization", which challenged the State of Mississippi's ban on abortion. The case was won in favour of the State by six votes to three. "We, therefore, hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion... and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives," part of the judgement read.
