Kenya Kwanza running mate Rigathi Gachagua now claims that Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui is late President Daniel Arap Moi's son. Speaking in Molo, Nakuru county on Friday, Gachagua defended himself saying that he has never worked in Molo, contrary to claims by a section of leaders that he was the DO when Molo clashes were happening in 1990s. Gachagua said Lee should apologise on behalf of his father because he was the president when the clashes were happening in Molo. He further said that he did nothing wrong that warrants an apology from him. "I can't apologise because we did nothing wrong. It's you Lee Kinyanjui who must apologise for the crimes perpetrated by your father who served as president and commander-in-chief when Molo residents suffered," Gachagua said. Gachagua's claims come after Kinyanjui asked Gachagua to apologise to the people of Molo. In a statement on June 21, Kinyanjui had said the apology is one of the things survivors of his tenure as District officer in Molo have requested from him. "During the tour, several suggestions have been raised by members of the public. Your kind consideration will be greatly appreciated. The first is a ‘public apology’ to the people of Molo for the commissions and omissions during his tenure as the dreaded DO," he said. "You can take the opportunity to assure them that you have since changed. This is a modest request from the survivors." He also scorned Gachagua saying that the Union of Nakuru University Students had requested that he delivers a keynote address on entrenching good governance and implementing Chapter Six of the Constitution.
