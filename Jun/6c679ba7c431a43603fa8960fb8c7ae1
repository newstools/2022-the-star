Kilome MP Thaddeus Nzambia has said hunger is a major threat to the government's Education policy on 100 per cent transition to secondary schools. Nzambia urged the government to release school feeding program funds to rescue hundreds of starving children across the country. He said lots of children were starving due to high inflation and hard economic times. Nzambia said children in day schools were the most affected. He said the situation is worse in the Ukambani region due to the drought that had rendered most families vulnerable and in need of relief food. The legislator who sits in the Departmental Committee on Education and Research said the government had allocated funds for the relief food programme in schools and hence need to disburse it to the institutions as fast as possible. "The common mwananchi is facing it rough due to hard economic times, Wanjiku can't afford three meals a day," Nzambia said. Nzambia spoke during the National Government Constituency Development Fund bursaries distribution in his constituency on Friday. "We have to address challenges faced by the common mwananchi. We as the Department Committee on Education and Research had passed and allocated enough funds for feeding programs in all-day schools in the country," Nzambia said. The MP said it was necessary for the government to treat the matter with the urgency it deserves and release the funds as fast as possible. "The government should release the money to schools so that food is bought for the starving children. This time around, crops haven't performed well due to drought. There hasn't been adequate rain, hence all parcels of land haven't performed well, " Nzambia said. He said there was no produce from the farms due to harsh weather and climate change. Nzambia said the feeding program retains children in school and contributes to improved performances in examinations.
