Luanda MP Chris Omulele has told off those criticising his performance in the last 10 years, saying he has done his best. The lawmaker said a man can only work within his capacity and with the resources available. "What I have been given as an MP under the National Government Constituency Development Fund has touched the lives of many residents of Luanda," Omulele said. He spoke in Luanda South ward on Monday, where he had taken his reelection campaigns. Omulele is seeking a third term. Omulele was elected as the first Luanda MP in 2013 on ODM party after the electoral area was split from the larger Emuhaya constituency. He was re-elected in 2017. Omulele urged residents to elect leaders who deliver services to them as he has done. "It's easier to criticise a man in the arena without knowing what he or she is going through," the MP said. “But the man in the arena knows the weight he/she is experiencing in that arena, so let’s just have respect for our leaders and let them do what they can do to their best level.” The lawmaker enumerated some of the projects in Emabungo and Wemilabi wards, where he has been accused of neglecting. “People say I have neglected the East, but this is an area I have worked better than the West,” he said. He said in Emabungo, he has used the NG-CDF kitty to improve Asiongo, Emuhaya and Ebulako primary schools. Others are Wekhomo chiefs’ office, Emmutsa, Ebuhando, Emmatsi primary schools and Emmatsi secondary, among other projects. In Wemilabi ward, the MP said he has done Ebubayi Secondary multipurpose hall and kitchen and improved Musinaka, Esirabe, Itabalia and Essongolo primary schools. Others are Ebubayi chief’s office, Ebubayi primary, Essongolo secondary dining hall, Ebulonga secondary computer lab, Irumbi chief's office, AP camp and completed the dormitory at Wandeche Special School. “I can’t name all the projects because we might end up spending two days here,” Omulele said.
