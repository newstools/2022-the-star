Through her social media, Betty said the show contains drama, love, hustle and sisterhood, which "will be the best thing on Kenyan television". "We work hard and play hard! All about the bag." Betty said she and her sisters also made their mother proud. "Cheers to Young Black African women who are every day rising, breaking barriers, chasing their dreams and living life boldly! We came, we saw, we are about to conquer. We also made our mama proud." Gloria, on the other hand shared, "We finally did it. Can't wait for y'all to see what we've dedicated our time and energy to! Prepare to be Entertained!"
