Zetech University Sparks are expected to field new signing Ashley Minayo in their opening Kenya national Basketball League (KNBL) match against Strathmore University this weekend. Minayo, who joined from Storms, is expected to boost the students back court play. Sparks coach Maurice Obilo, who got the better of Strathmore in both legs last year as they went on to finish third, remains upbeat their new addition will prove her worth for the team. “The girls have been preparing well. We are at strength and we expect to come out strongly in our first league match,” said Obilo. However, Sparks will miss the services of international point guard Debra Obunga who is in the 3×3 camp in preparations for next month’s Commonwealth Games. Women champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) will host two city teams — Eagle Wings and Storms — in the Premier League.

Eldonets, who rely on sharp-shooter James Omweno, will then close the two-game tour of the city with a match against Strathmore University Blades.
