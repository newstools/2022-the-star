The Ghana Education Service has denied a widely circulated publication claiming that a teacher trainee impregnated 24 school girls, four female teachers, and the headmistress at one of the government schools at Asokore Mampong Municipality, in the Ashanti Region. In a statement, the Municipal Education Directorate termed the publication as false noting that it has never engaged Colleges of Education to place teacher trainees in any of its schools since its founding. “Teacher trainees are posted within their home regions. Trainees are posted to schools in districts within their region of studies and are mostly sent to schools that lack trained teachers. Asokore Mampong does not have such a challenge,” the GES said in a press statement. The directorate noted that all the eight schools in the municipality are headed by males, except one which is headed by a female described as a woman in her advanced age and preparing to go on retirement next year. The statement added that the municipality is an example of a massive decline in teenage pregnancies. “The Directorate has records to prove the reduction of teenage pregnancy in our schools. The Girls’ Education unit has over the past 3 years recorded a lower number of pregnant school girls in schools in our Municipality,” part of the release stated. The Directorate admonished the media to contact them to verify or confirm issues regarding education in the municipality at any time. The news which began circulating in the early hours of Friday, June 3, 2022, generated public uproar between some teachers and other Ghanaians on social media. Many teachers believed that the publication is an indictment of the teaching profession and must be investigated by the Teacher Unions and the Law Enforcement Agencies.
