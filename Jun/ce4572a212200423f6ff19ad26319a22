The venue for the crunch Kenyan Premier League clash between Kakamega Homeboyz and Kariobangi Sharks has been switched from Bukhungu Stadium to the neighbouring Mumias Complex. The season is set to end with eight matches scheduled for Sunday and this particular encounter will be one of the two that will determine who bags the title. Equally crucial is the tie pitting Tusker against Posta Rangers. Homeboyz are tied on points with Tusker at the summit of the log, with the Ruaraka-based brewers enjoying a healthier goal difference. Both have amassed 60 points from 31 matches thus far. Whereas the brewers have found the back of the net 38 times, they have soaked in 17 goals in return. On the other hand, Homeboyz have slammed the net a whopping 49 times and let in 32. Anything short of a win for Homeboyz will hand Tusker the title on a silver platter. The brewers require a win and a comparatively higher goal margin to successfully retain their title should Homeboyz pull off maximum points. Tusker will be keen to defend the title they clinched in the preceding season after dethroning record champions Gor Mahia. Editing by Tony Mballa
