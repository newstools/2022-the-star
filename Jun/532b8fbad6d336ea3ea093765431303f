The name of a newly launched media company owned by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka has caused a stir in Kenya. Osaka launched the new media company, Hana Kuma, in partnership with four-time NBA champion LeBron James. She aims at telling stories that cross-cultural barriers, the former world number one announced on Tuesday. According to her, Hana Kuma, means "flower bear," which will produce stories that are "culturally specific but universal to all audiences" and already has multiple projects lined up. However, the name Hana Kuma has been trending in Kenya pricking the curiosity of an ordinary person why that Swahili name is trending. And while the name sounds intriguing in Japanese dialects, in Swahili it has a totally different meaning that is not pleasant at all. In Swahili, Hana Kuma - means the person has no Virgina. Here are some reactions from Kenyans; Osaka told the New York Times that what excites her is being able to inspire people and tell new stories. "... particularly ones that I would have wanted to see when I was a kid. I always wanted to kind of see someone like me," she said. James and Maverick Carter's The SpringHill Company will serve as financing, operations and producing partner for Hana Kuma, New York Times reported.
