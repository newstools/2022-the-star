The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) now wants the Dispute Resolution Committee to haste in their hearing of the 262 complaints made after registrations. The Commission Chairperson Wafula Chebukati while presiding over the launching of the Committee at Milimani Law Courts on Saturday said the ruling should be delivered within 48 hours of the hearing. The three Panels will start the hearing of the disputes lodged arising from the recently concluded Registration of Candidates for different elective positions today, Saturday. Section 74 of the Elections Act provides that electoral disputes shall be determined within ten days of the lodging of the dispute with the Commission. The Committee will therefore hold its hearings for the next 10 days at Milimani Law Courts. "Like every process, anyone who is aggrieved is allowed to challenge the decisions made by the returning officers,” Chebukati said. He urged the committee members to adhere to the principles of natural justice. "I just want to remind you that this is an election process subject to scrutiny. Let everybody be heard and also observe strict adherence to the Constitution and the law while handling the complaints before you." He added that those who will be dissatisfied with the decision of the committee will seek other remedies that including going to the High Court. During the launch, the Commission pointed out that it is responsible for the settlement of electoral disputes, including disputes relating to or arising from nominations. It however said it is excluded from settling election petitions and disputes subsequent to the declaration of election results.
