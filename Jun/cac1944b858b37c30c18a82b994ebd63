Thirdway Alliance Kenya party has now moved to court to seek nullification of the presidential nomination exercise. In a statement signed by the party leader Ekuru Aukot and chairman Miruru Waweru, the party claims the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) worked in a biased and discriminatory manner. "It flouted not just the Constitution of Kenya 2010, but also the enabling legislation," the party said in part in its statement. The party said the electoral body and its chair Wafula Chebuakti deliberately carried out a subjective selection process instead of a nomination exercise. Aukot and Waweru added that Chebukati did not verify the ID copies against the supporter lists submitted by the aspirants. The two accused the IEBC of issuing nomination certificates to predetermined candidates. "We shall urge the High Court to order IEBC to deposit the submitted copies and supporter lists for scrutiny in a court-supervised process." The party added that it will urge the court to bar the Commission from printing the presidential ballot papers until all lists and ID copies are re-verified. "He applied different standards in clearing aspirants to run for office of President, to wit, some aspirants were allowed time to regularize their shortfall," the two said. The Commission cleared four candidates including Raila Odinga (Azimio), William Ruto (Kenya Kwanza), George Wajackoyah (Roots Party) and David Mwaure (Agano Party).
