Kenyan female boxer Fatuma Zarika unveiled her new house on Saturday June 4, 2022 in a ceremony attended by close family including her brother former Gor Mahia player Musa Mohammed, friends and SportPesa Executives. Zarika whose journey to boxing stardom was marred by many challenges including disappointments by previous promoters has been able to turn around her life thanks to continued sponsorship by SportPesa. It is through this partnership that she is now a home owner. The three-bedroomed house is located in a gated community on Kenyatta Road in Kiambu. It was developed by Mizizi Homes. “I’m so happy and today is a big day for me. I want to thank Sportpesa for the love and support they have shown me. Acquiring this house has been made possible thanks to my sponsors Sportpesa. They not only look at how you play the game but also look after your future,” Fatuma Zarika said during the unveiling of her new home. During the event, the celebrated boxer decried the poor performance of female boxers at the just ended World Boxing Championships that were held in Istanbul, Turkey. She said the poor show by Kenyan female pugilists is as a result of various factors including lack of proper sponsorship, training programmes and infrastructure as well as general social welfare due to financial constraints which affects their mental well-being and concentration in matches. Fatuma Zarika, who gave birth while still a teenager said she was inspired to pursue a career in boxing to fend for her baby, a sport that has catapulted her to the global stage. Speaking during the official handing over of maternal health care equipment donated by SportPesa Foundation at the Kilifi County Teaching and Referral Hospital in January, Zarika emphasized the need to work hard and rise above challenges. "Giving birth at a young age should give you the drive to work harder for your children as I have done in my life, rising above the challenges to better their lives,” Zarika said.
