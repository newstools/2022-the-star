Nairobi county returning officer Albert Gogo has said it was not within his mandate to establish the validity of the certificate presented by Johnson Arthur Sakaja for clearance. Defending himself from any wrongdoing, Gogo in his response told the IEBC tribunal that his mandate was only to confirm if the candidate met all the requirements as provided for in law. Through his lawyer Moses Kipkogei, Gogo argued that the burden of proof to confirm the allegations of the invalidity of the certificate lies on the complainant and should not be shifted. “The role of the county returning officer in the nomination process was to receive the documents from the candidates but not go beyond his mandate to confirm the validity of the certificates, for this lies on the complainant’s part,” Kipkogei said. “It was incumbent upon the complainant to travel to Uganda and confirm the validity of the certificate if in doubt.” He urged the committee not to shift the burden of proof to the county returning officer as alleged by lawyer Paul Nyamodi who represented Dennis Kaguu, the complainant. Gogo further stated that he cleared more than 20 candidates in the same manner and that the certificates presented to him were valid and the candidates were qualified to be cleared. He further argued that the ruling on the matter is scheduled for June 19, 2022.
