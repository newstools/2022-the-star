Top female judoka, Perister Bosire is targeting to finish on the podium as she steps up her preparations ahead of this month's Commonwealth Games. She expressed her optimism for a good show, noting that with sufficient time allocated for training, she will win a medal. "My goal is to make it to the podium and bring a medal home," she added. Bosire has also noted an improvement in her prowess in judo as she looks forward to good competition in Birmingham. " There is a remarkable improvement in my career. I was far off the mark but thanks to my coach Joseph Mburu, things are starting to look up," she added. Mburu, who is also the national judo coach, is confident the entire team will pull good results in Birmingham. Bosire made history by becoming the first Kenyan female to win the gold medal in the women`s over-78kg at the Africa Open judo tournament in Dakar last year. Kenya's other previous medalist at an international event was Esther Akinyi who won silver during the African Judo Championships held in Maputo in 2013 in the open class event. After missing out on the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Judo has now been classed as a compulsory sport thus marking its return to the Games program. Kevin Munangwe and Felista Marangi are among the top Judokas who will make their debut in this year's Commonwealth Games. The team is currently training at the Moi Sports Centre, Kasarani,  as they await the big day which has attracted 71 countries.
