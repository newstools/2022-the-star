Harmonize has tattooed Kajala’s face on his leg, days after the two allegedly reconciled. The Bongo superstar and actress Frida Kajala broke up a year ago, days after he disrespected the actress. During their few months dating, Konde Boy and Kajala got matching tattoos of their name initials: ‘K’ for Harmonize and ‘H’ for Kajala. After their break-up, Kajala covered up her tattoo with a red rose, while Harmonize replaced his with ‘Konde Gang’. In a recent photo, fans spotted a new tattoo on Harmonize’s leg. Harmonize announced their possible reunion last week. Kajala fuelled the rumours after she insinuated on Instagram that she was ready to pardon him. "Forgiveness isn’t saying what they did was okay, it’s just saying you won’t hold onto that negative energy any longer."
