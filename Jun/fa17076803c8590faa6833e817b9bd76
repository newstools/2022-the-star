Human rights defenders in Kisumu have urged residents to shun divisive leaders in the upcoming polls. Led by Audi Ogada, the activists said divisive politics was unhealthy for the progress of sustainable development, peace and unity in the country. The voters, Ogada said, have the democratic right to elect development-oriented leaders to help spur socioeconomic growth. “Let us make wise decisions as citizens in the forthcoming general election to initiate a culture of good governance, unity and political tolerance in the country,” he said. Ogada also called on residents to promote peace and unity instead of voting in leaders who only focus on dividing them along tribal lines. “We have seen increased political insecurity in the country. Some politicians have been making reckless and provocative statements that might have plunged the country into violence,” he said. Ogada said stern action should be taken against leaders hell-bent on promoting their selfish political interests, saying they should not be given a platform to incite, spread hate and intolerance. He asked police to remain committed to resolving increased political insecurity in the region, adding that they should focus on protection of life and property, as well as prevention and detection of crime. The activist said it was in the public domain that there have been continuous reported cases of violence without conclusive police action in Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay and Migori counties.
