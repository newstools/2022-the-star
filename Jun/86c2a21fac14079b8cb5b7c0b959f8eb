The ministry of education has rolled out the sports calendar to primary and secondary schools. A circular written by administration secretary Andrew Rukaria on behalf of the Principal secretary revealed that games will resume next month. "It has been resolved that in term one 2022 the primary and secondary schools compete at all levels," the circular reads. The circular dated June,22 was addressed to all regional county directors, county directors and sub-county directors in the education sector. At the onset of COVID-19, the ministry directed all co-curricular activities to be suspended. Despite communicating, last year, that the games were to resume, the ministry had not released a timetable for the same. "This will allow qualifying athletes to participate in the world under 20 trials," the circular added. The ministry has directed the activities to resume gradually and will take place in three institutions. Primary school games and secondary school athletics will take place in Kigari TTC from July,2 to July 4, and July 3, to July,7 respectively. "Secondary and primary schools special needs education games will take place at Machakos TTC from July,2 to July, 4. Regional games will take place on June,30," the circular reads. As the games proceed, the ministry has rolled out a set of directives to be followed to prevent the spread of COVID 19. "Incorporation of a medical officer from the ministry of health and the number of participants will be limited to 20," the circular reads. School heads have also been advised to use the least number of officials and competition days.
