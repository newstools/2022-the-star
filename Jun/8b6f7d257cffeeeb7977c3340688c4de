A 13-member committee has been constituted to take over from the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Transition Committee whose term ends on Thursday. The 13, who are football administrators drawn from FKF branches and leagues across the country were selected during an FKF Special General Meeting held at Moi Stadium, Kasarani in Nairobi on Saturday. However, the committee will only carry out its mandate once gazetted by Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed. The meeting settled on Murang’a Seal chairman Robert Macharia as chairman with Amos Otieno (Nairobi East) and Luthers Mokua (Nyamira) being elected vice-chairman and secretary-general respectively. The rest of the membership comprise Boaz Keino (Upper Rift Valley), Kenneth Ruto (Lower Rift Valley), Caleb Amwai (Western), Lilian Nadunda (Coast), Abdullahi Salat (North Eastern), Alex Musikeri (Eastern), Chris Mmbwanga (FKF-Premier League clubs), Ken Ochieng (National Super League clubs), Kent Lubiso (FKF Division One Leagues) and Paul Makumi (Kenya Women Premier League clubs). Sources confirmed that the seven-hour meeting had the blessings of CS Amina and was, actually, attended by some members of the Transition Committee. Addressing the media after the meeting, Macharia said that they have scheduled a meeting with the CS sometime this week, with the smooth transition highlighting the agenda. “After many hours of deliberation, we have finally found a solution to the the current stalemate in football. We have had an election of 13 members to represent the General Assembly and FKF in general in matters of football in this country," Macharia said. "We have a hybrid group here composed of club representatives, branches and gender is taken care of here,” he added. Editing by Tony Mballa
