Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah has said he was once disqualified from vying for a member of parliament seat in Tottenham, UK. In an interview with NTV, Wajackoyah said he was eliminated because he was not married. He explained at the primary level after filling a questionnaire, he skipped the married part because he was not legally married. Wajackoyah said they had children, but they were yet to officiate the marriage. "I have stood for elections in the UK. I was told you are not enough. You are not ripe enough to be a member of parliament for Tottenham because we have checked in this list that you have children but no wife," Wajackoyah said. The lawyer said he did not try and put any justification to show that he was married and decided to let go of the ambition. The Roots Party presidential candidate has become a sensation in Kenya after he declared his presidential bid. He has said he will legalise marijuana for medicinal purposes, as well as venture into snake farming to generate more revenue for the country. Wajackoyah was cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries commission on June 2, to run for presidency. He embarked on campaigns to popularise his presidential bid across the country after receiving the IEBC green light.
