Any opinion poll showing that Raila Odinga is leading was manipulated by state agencies to demoralise UDA supporters, Vihiga woman representative candidate Jackline Mwenesi has said. Mwenesi said UDA's Deputy President William Ruto is leading, but the state is manipulating the real numbers to blackmail the public that Raila is leading. Mwenesi was addressing the press at IEBC headquarters after being cleared at Chavakali High School on Sunday. She said Ruto will win in the forthcoming general elections. “We are set and we are going to deliver for our presidential candidate Ruto,” Mwenesi said. The nominated MCA said they will vote UDA candidates from the president to MCA positions. “It is UDA presidential candidate who is on the ballot and he must have more MPs, senators in the house for him to deliver, therefore I urge my people to vote for UDA from top to the bottom,” she said. Mwenesi’s urged residents to also consider at least one ANC candidate in the polls. Already the IEBC has cleared 12 candidates to vie for the woman rep seat held by Beatrice Adagala of ANC. The candidates include Winnie Majani of ODM, Kevina Oriedo(Jubilee), Violet Bagada(UDP), Magret Mbuni(Kanu), Mary Amalemba (DAP-K), Afandi Lukalo(MDG), Ruth Bukachi(Independent), Rhodah Mbandu (Ford Kenya) and Lorna Obiri.
