Deputy President William Ruto has pledged to provide a free three-month supply of diapers to nursing mothers should he be elected President. The DP said his administration will empower women through leadership roles and ensure their needs are well taken care of. "All mothers to be supplied with diapers for the first three months if Kenya Kwanza takes government," he said. This arrangement, he said, will be covered by an enhanced NHIF medical cover. Ruto was speaking on Friday while attending the Kenya Kwanza Women charter conference at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi. He was expected to sign the charter and officially make women leaders part of his campaign. The move is said to be aimed at countering the Azimio wave caused by the choice of Martha Karua as Raila Odinga's running mate. The DP further said his administration will purpose to expedite the actualization of the two-thirds gender rule within the first 90 days of his presidency. "Within three months, if Kenya Kwanza forms government, we will immediately operationalise that mechanism so that women don't have to wait for long," Ruto said. The DP also said his administration will establish a Sh50 billion Hustler Fund which will advance loans to small businesses without interest. This, he said, will save the small and medium entrepreneurs the burden of footing huge interests on loans. "All women with deals in AGPO will be automatically given an opportunity," Ruto said. AGPO stands for Access to Government Procurement Opportunities.
