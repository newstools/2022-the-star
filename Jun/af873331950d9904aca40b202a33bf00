A city police officer is hospitalised after sustaining injuries from a brawl involving two bar attendants. According to the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, the officer based at Kware police station in Embakasi had gone for a few drinks at the Villa police station canteen, when the incident occurred. “The officer left his place of work after his shift and opted to enjoy the rest of the night irrigating his throat with a few swallows, at the Villa police station canteen. While imbibing his drinks he engaged one of the bar stewards who was serving him identified as Lucy Mueni in a hearty conversation,” he said. “Mueni appeared to have been smitten by the recently graduated officer as she would sit next to him giggling in excitement, whenever she was not serving the rest of the patrons.” This, however, did not go down well with her colleague identified as Favian Nekesa, who was at the canteen’s counter. According to DCI, Nekesa was equally attracted to the police officer with whom she might have had an affair with before. “Unbeknownst to Mueni, her colleague was equally attracted to the cop with an athletic physique and a neatly trimmed moustache. They must have had a thing before. Unable to take any more of their shenanigans, Nekesa left the counter flying and launched a barrage of blows and kicks at the hapless Mueni who was sent tumbling on the floor injuring her head and hands.” After attacking Mueni, Nekesa turned to the cop whom he attacked with flying objects. The commotion attracted police officers on patrol who rushed to control the situation. Mueni and the cop were then escorted to Mukuru health centre for medical attention before they were discharged. However, the officer’s condition deteriorated and at around 3 am and was rushed to a city hospital where he is currently admitted in stable condition. Detectives are investigating the incident.
