A woman narrated to an Eldoret court how she stabbed her husband in the stomach after a domestic dispute. Ruth Chepkurui, 22,  pleaded guilty to the offence before Eldoret Chief Magistrate Dennis Mikoyan on Tuesday and said she was defending herself. "Your honour, I am remorseful of what happened, and I was only defending myself from the hostile lover," she said. The mother of one also told the court that she attacked her lover, James Rorman, on allegations of having extramarital affairs, something she said pushed her to the wall, leading to a fight. The court was told that the accused attacked the complainant on the night of May 26 at Boma village in Turbo Sub-County within Uasin Gishu County and unlawfully subjected him to grievous harm. According to the witnesses, the two engaged in a physical fight before the woman reportedly drew a kitchen knife and stabbed her lover. One of the neighbours said the duo had been having frequent domestic fights. "On the night of the incident, we heard a commotion only to learn that the accused confronted her husband upon learning he was having an affair with another woman," said one of her neighbours. The injured man was rushed to Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret, in critical condition, where he was admitted for six days and discharged on June 3. A medical examination report from Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital indicated that he was seriously injured. The court ordered probation officers to do a social inquiry about the general character of the accused ahead of sentencing. The case will be mentioned on June 27.
