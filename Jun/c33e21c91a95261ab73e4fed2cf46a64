Detectives based at Kileleshwa, Nairobi County, arrested a robbery suspect and another one escaped after a dramatic chase on Saturday. The two were allegedly planning an attack on two businessmen when they were ambushed by the detectives. Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti said the action followed a tip-off received by the officers, who quickly pounced on the suspects before they staged their attack. The thugs who were using a motorbike as their getaway means were cornered along Laikipia Road in Kilimani by the officers who ordered them to surrender immediately. Police say the thugs defied the order to surrender and escaped in different directions, leaving their motorbike behind. "This prompted a chase that pit the thugs against the officers... It wasn’t long before one of the thugs was swept off his feet before he landed on the ground with a thud," DCI said in a tweet. According to the detectives,  an angry mob that was chasing closely behind descended on one of the suspects with blows and kicks, leaving him with serious injuries. "They disfigured his dental arrangement and left him with a swollen eye. The thug writhed on the ground in pain begging for forgiveness." He was rescued from the angry mob that was baying for his blood after the police called for reinforcement. A homemade pistol loaded with one round of 9mm was recovered from the suspect identified as Eric Musungu, from Kawangware 46 area. The second suspect escaped and detectives are still looking for him. Musungu was booked in custody pending arraignment on Sunday morning.
