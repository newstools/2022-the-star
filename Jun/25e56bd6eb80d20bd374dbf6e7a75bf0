Ngina Kenyatta got married at a traditional wedding over the weekend. The hush-hush wedding ceremony was revealed by the former State House Digital Strategist Dennis Itumbi. Itumbi tweeted the details, "Ngina Kenyatta, Congratulations on your Traditional Wedding." Adding, "May God fill your journey with blessings solidify your union with renewed love and importantly grant you a great family." The first family's daughter Ngina is known to keep her private life away from the public. She was engaged to Alex Mwai son of the Karen Club General Manager Mr Sam Mwai. Alex is an Investment Director at Hesabu and previously worked with Ken Gen company. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Dedham University in the UK and ABF from IEB school in Real Madrid. A source told Mpasho that the theme of the wedding was red. "The bride looked stunning in her outfit and her bridal party was dressed in red. The event was fabulous and everyone was dressed up and ready to celebrate the newest married couple in town." Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta's daughter gave birth to her first child at a city hospital. Our source said, "Ngina Kenyatta is giving birth there. She's already at the hospital." Her philanthropic mother, first lady Margaret Kenyatta, was also spotted at the hospital. At the time, Ngina hadn't been seen in public for many months, prompting speculation about her whereabouts. The interesting thing is that Mpasho had also heard it through the grapevine late last month that Ngina was getting married to the son of a famous business tycoon.
