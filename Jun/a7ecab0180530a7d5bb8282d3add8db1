The viral photo of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential running mate Martha Karua with TSP party leader Mwangi Kiunjuri and Former MP Kabando wa Kabando was taken in 2021. Fact-checker has established that the photo first emerged on social media in February 2021. It was first shared by Karua who said she had just met friends for a cup of tea. The photo was shared widely by Azimio supporters on Wednesday, some claiming Kiunjuri was getting ready to decamp Kenya Kwanza. The photo went viral just a few hours before Karua's rally in Kirinyaga. Some said Karua met the former CS ahead of his unveiling as the new entrant to Azimio Coalition. However, Kiunjuri was not part of Karua's rally on Wednesday hence the need to treat the information surrounding the picture with caution.
