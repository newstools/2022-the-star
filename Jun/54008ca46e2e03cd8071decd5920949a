@robertomollo3 Residents of Rarage Village in Ndhiwa have protested the delay by Kenya Power to restore electricity in the area. The residents said they have been in darkness since the main transformer broke down two months ago. This, they said, interrupted the power supply in the area. Led by Dalmus Anditi, they decried that the prolonged outage has interfered with various businesses. Anditi on Thursday said there was a likelihood of a rise in insecurity with burglary cases having been reported in the recent past. “Traders who deal in beverages can’t continue with their business because the electricity supply has been cut off. We’re asking the responsible authority to urgently intervene,” he said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town, Anditi said failure to replace the damaged transformer has affected learning at Rarage Mixed Secondary School. Anditi said many learners cannot attend evening classes. The residents blamed Kenya Power for  slow response despite them reporting the incident on time. “Kenya Power has many functional transformers but we don't know why they can't replace ours. We’ve presented our grievances to them but no action has been taken,” he said. However, Kenya Power officers in Homa Bay led by manager Ken Okumbe said they are working on ways of restoring the transformer.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
