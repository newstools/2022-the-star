Jamaican reggae artist Eric Donaldson has promised his fans a thrilling show on Saturday at the Carnivore grounds. This is his first show in Kenya and his second in Africa. He is known for hits like Traffic Jam, Lonely Night, I Need Someone and Cherry Oh Baby, among others. The artist has been running a few projects, among them visiting a children's home in Kibra. Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu praised the artist for his great music. Speaking after hosting Donaldson for a lunch meeting on Tuesday, Kananu urged Kenyan musicians to emulate the legendary artist by composing songs that will change society. "I’m sure reggae fans will enjoy his performance. I’m urging all reggae fans to turn up in large numbers," she said. Donaldson said music should make an impact on society. "Songs are like education to the people. Music must bring love and joy to the people," he said.
