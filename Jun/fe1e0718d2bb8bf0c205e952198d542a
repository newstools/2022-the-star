Strathmore University lock horns with Young City in a men's Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league match at Nyayo National Stadium on Saturday. The students, who are last year's runners-up, are highly favoured to carry the day as they have too much firepower. Young City coach Fredrick Omolle said although his deaf side have a lot to learn, especially coordinating with the referees, they will soon cope. They lost 40-14 to Black Mamba and were felled 25-15 by Buccaneers but Omolle said they are learning fast and will soon get favourable results. In other matches of the day, Ulinzi play Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat), Technical University of Kenya (Tuk) meet GSU as Thika face NCC men.
