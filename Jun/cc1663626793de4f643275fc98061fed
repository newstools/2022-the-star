Machakos Level 5 Hospital health workers on Monday downed their tools bringing operations at the facility to a standstill. The health care workers are demanding promotions to respective job groups and protesting against what they termed as non-payments of their dues. They claim that the Machakos County Assembly had allocated Sh10 million to effect their promotions which they allege Machakos County Government has failed to honour. "We have lots of problems here as health workers. Funds were allocated by the Machakos County Assembly, Sh10 million, three months ago to enable us to get promoted to our next job groups as per our norms," Michael Saka, a nurse at the facility said. "So, we are wondering why the Board is sitting on our letters instead of promoting us?" Saka addressed the press during the demonstrations on Monday. He said they will not resume duties until their demands were met. "So, we are saying as from now, we won't do the work until we are given our promotion letters. If they give us the letters, we will resume our duties," Saka said. "If they don't, we won't resume duties," he added. "There is a major problem in this hospital. Our queries are promotions and the allocated funds. Let them give us our letters." Those who have downed their tools include doctors, nurses, lab technicians, and pharmacists. "We are all represented in these protests and asking for our very simple rights," Saka said. "We want the letters as from today. The money is available, we need to be given our letters and money." He said they will be picketing every other day until their demands were met. "We have a whole portion of the population that are unpromoted. Our ultimatum is that we want those letters issued by tomorrow," he said.
