IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati now says he has no powers to investigate chaos marring political rallies in the country. In a statement on Monday, Chebukati said the Commission has no constitutional mandate to probe violence witnessed at the Kenya Kwanza Alliance rally in Jacaranda grounds, Nairobi, on Sunday. "The Hight Court declared the Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee unconstitutional... It is only the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) that has the power to order investigations and to probe offenders under the Act," the statement read. Deputy President William Ruto's convoy was pelted with stones while on his way to Jacaranda grounds sparking uproar among his supporters. Chebukati has, however, directed DPP Noordin Haji to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the Jacaranda grounds violence. The IEBC boss also condemned the violent behaviour adding that it endangered the lives and properties of Kenyans. He further reminded all candidates, political parties, supporters of candidates and the Government to observe the peace during this period. "And indeed all Kenyans that they have a duty to adhere to the Electoral Code of conduct and shun from violence, intimidation and reprisals that may comprise the conduct of the free, fair and peaceful election," he said adding that the acts may jeopardize the security of the country. During the Jacaranda violence, youths allied to Ruto engaged those affiliated with ODM leader Raila Odinga in a stone-throwing contest of sorts leaving five injured. Among those injured is Embaksi East UDA parliamentary candidate Francis Mureithi. Ruto blamed the chaos on Raila who he accused of hiring youths to disrupt his rally. Raila, however, dismissed the DP remarks and accused him of seeking sympathy votes.
