Sirikoi, one of the iconic lions at the Nairobi National Park is dead. The Kenya Wildlife Service said on Saturday the majestic lion died aged eight years. "A king has rested," KWS said in a tweet. "Sirikoi was born in January 2014 in the Sosian Valley. He came from the MF family one of the dominant and charismatic pride," the service added. According to KWS, the majestic lion possessed tactical and amazing hunting skills that enabled him take down big preys like giraffes and buffaloes without the help of the pride. "Notably, he had a distinctive dark mane which is a strong indicator of a lion’s health, vigor and strength as well as testosterone levels," KWS said. KWS revealed that plans are underway to immortalise the iconic lion king at the National Museum of Kenya. Sirikoi was reportedly the leader of the Kingfisher pride. He is said to have been injured during a hunt around April and was unable to walk properly. KWS caged him but he unfortunately dislocated his jaw in an attempt to free himself from the enclosure. "RIP Sirikoi. May your spirit live on in your offspring and possibly with the two other females carrying your cubs," KWS said. Sirikoi is one of the most filmed lions owing to his unique hunting skills. On March 30, 2016, Mohawk the lion, another of Kenya's most famous big cats, was shot and killed by wildlife rangers. The shooting came after the lion pounced on a man in a crowd shortly after it escaped from the park.
