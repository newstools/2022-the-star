Kenya Revenue Authority(KRA) in collaboration with the county government and the NairobiMetropolitan Services(NMS) call for taxmen to adopt the revenue e-services platform. The Nairobi Revenue System (NRS) has been operational since June last year and is challenged with low use and awareness. With records from last year’s financial year report, tax collection in July 2021 reached Sh121.8 billion compared to Sh94.4 billion over a similar period a year back. This was an improvement. Nairobi however failed to reach its own-source revenue target, despite the efforts by the authority to maximize tax compliance. More adoption of the platform will help address the target deficits that come as a result of tax non-compliance. The platform dubbed ‘KRA sasa wako digital’ main targets includes property agents, service providers, land owners, advertising service providers, business owners, food handlers and any resident who parks in public spaces within the county. The aforementioned city taxmen presumably operate almost entirely on digital platforms hence the initiative will further the convenience of functioning whenever and from wherever. This is because anything that is packaged with a digital option gets consideration and even gets chosen over options that do not offer the digitality. The e-service will see the taxman conduct his duties easily and fast with satisfaction fulfilling the primary needs of the taxpayers. The service offers more benefits in that it provides integrated customer touch points these are the mobile app, web portal and the USSD. The online services also offer simplified customer interfaces to cater for different demographics. The inbuilt payment system enables customers to make payments on the system through various payment methods such as mobile money, cards and bank transfer.
