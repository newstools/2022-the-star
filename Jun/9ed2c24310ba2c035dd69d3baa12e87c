Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are set for the Kenya National  Basketball League after their pre-season preparations in Rwanda and Uganda. The porters, who returned to the country on Tuesday from Kampala, trained and played a series of friendly matches against top teams in the two countries. Anthony Ojukwu, the women's coach, said everything went as planned during the tour and learned a lot of lessons. "For me, it was training and learning. We worked on pre-season training, agility, conditioning and ball work," noted Ojukwu. While in Kigali, the team also played two friendly games against the Rwanda Energy Group team, losing both ties 36-28 and 55-44. The Kenyan champions also had a chance to watch top teams in the continent battle it out in Basketball Africa League (BAL) finals at the iconic Arena. In Kampala, they played friendly matches against Kampala International University (KIU) Rangers, going down 67-60. KPA trailed 37-27 at the break and were pepped by the national team trio of Natalie Akinyi, Selina Okumu and Velma Achieng who combined for 27 points. The men's side, on the other hand, were down 30-24 at the breather and went on to lose 59-57 in a closely fought duel.
