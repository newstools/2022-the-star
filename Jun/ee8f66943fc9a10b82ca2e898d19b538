Tanzanian gossip king Juma Lokole claims Juma Jux has been dumped by his girlfriend because of Kenyan socialite Huddah Monroe. Speaking while appearing on Wasafi Media on Monday, Lokole said Jux's girlfriend packed her bags after Jux took Huddah to his home, where she has been living with the singer. Speaking to Diva the Bawse, he said Jux had convinced the girlfriend that his relationship with Huddah was strictly business. Apparently, Jux unsuccessfully tried to get rid of her before Huddah's arrival in Tanzania but she refused to leave. "Since their first song, Jux has been seeing Huddah. He told Huddah to come to Tanzania. So Jux tried to break up with his girlfriend but she told Jux she is not leaving his house," Lokole said. Jux and Huddah say they are just friends.
