ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday dismissed claims that he is part of the Jubilee government saying his role was just to offer to advise on a need basis. In response to accusations levelled toward him over the rising cost of living, Raila exonerated himself from blame saying he has no official role in government. "Kenyans are not stupid. Kenyans know I am not in government. I don't earn a salary, I don't live in a government house. I dont get any allowance from the government. But I advise. But the advice is just advice; the receiver can use it or not," he said. Raila was speaking at a conference with the media on Tuesday in Karen. On the rising cost of living, Raila called for an understanding of the prevailing economic conditions worldwide. He said some external forces have hugely contributed to the rising cost of living. "When the cost of crude oil goes up, everything else goes up in a country... Because everything else depends on oil in terms of manufacturing," he added. He took a swipe at Deputy President William Ruto for abdicating his duties and blaming others yet he benefits from the government he attacks daily. "It is unfair to do a blanket condemnation. Someone who is earning a salary has more than 250 security officers from the government and is using government vehicles for the campaign is coming out to say ask Kitendawili who is in government. He claims he was ejected from the government. Lakini kama ulitolewa, basi jiuzulu."
