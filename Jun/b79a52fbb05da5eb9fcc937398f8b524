The Ministry of Health has called on Kenyans who have cold/flu like symptoms to stay at home, as one of the measures to reduce exposure and transmission of respiratory infections. The ministry on Monday noted that the country is entering into the cold season with an expected increase in the number of cases of respiratory diseases during this period. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe said three out of the eight influenza surveillance sites in the country; Kakuma, Kenyatta National Hospital and Nakuru are reporting an increase in the number of flu cases. Kenya normally records two flu seasons with the first season starting from March and lasts until May, while the second starts from July and lasts through to October/November. “If you have flu like symptoms please stay at home, don’t go to work and expose other people because flu/ common cold, covid like other respiratory tract infections are highly transmissible,” Ag Health DG Patrick Amoth said. Among other measures the ministry has advised Kenyans to take include keeping warm to avoid triggering flu like situations, keeping hydrated, avoiding crowded places and exercising regularly. “Also eat a healthy balanced diet especially one rich in fruits and vegetables especially the green leafy vegetables because they contain antioxidants which enhance our immunity,” Amoth said. He added: “Of course despite doing all these if you happen to get a respiratory tract infection the next course of action is to seek medical advice from a qualified medical provider or facility and then you will be able to get the correct treatment.” Flu vaccines are available at between Sh1,000 and Sh2,000 but they are largely not available in public hospitals. Experts in the past have advised that children under five years and adults above 65 should get vaccinated against flu, adding that these, alongside people with weakened immunity, suffer the most when they catch the influenza virus.
