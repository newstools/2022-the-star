President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off the Word Rally Championship (WRC) Safari Rally on Thursday from Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, marking the official start of the race. The rally has been termed by the president as the second one under his government. "We take pride in hosting the WRC Safari Rally 2022  as it has inspired many generations and it is an event that unifies Kenya by coming together in participating in different ways," he said. The 2022 rally will be hosted in Naivasha from 23rd to 26th June. He flagged off the first ten rally cars which included Kenyan teams comprising McRae Kimathi, Maxine Wahome, Jeremy Wahome, Hamza Anwar and the French megastars Sebastian Ogier and Sebastien Loeb who are gracing the iconic Kenyan fixture for the second time. Uhuru said that the rally was a major boost to the transport and hospitality sectors. Hotels in Naivasha previously recorded an unprecedented sellout, which was good for Kenya’s fast-rising sports tourism. "This was and will be a boost to our economy," he said. He also added that Safari Rally enjoys a special place in the country’s national heritage as it tells the story of its rich cultural tapestry, the warmth of its people and the diversity of its splendour. The Head of State expressed optimism that this year’s event will be bigger and attract more spectators across the world. He thanked the World Rally Championship team and all stakeholders for organizing the successful event. Sports, Culture and Heritage CS Amina Mohamed thanked the president for ensuring that the global event came back to Kenya. Amina pointed out that Uhuru's determination and commitment have born fruits that will see the country host the event uninterrupted for the next five years.
