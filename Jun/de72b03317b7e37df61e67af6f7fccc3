Azimio Presidential candidate Raila Odinga has refuted claims that he wants to shut the mitumba industry saying he was misunderstood and taken out of context. Speaking at a business forum in Nairobi county on Tuesday, he said the industry cannot be killed as it is creating employment for so many people. Raila told his opponents to shun propaganda even as he urged mitumba stakeholders to disregard them. He further promised that his administration would empower the business sector to ensure those who rely on it are not out of business. "Mitumba is not a dead-end business and it has created employment for so many of our people. I am defending them and there are people who are bringing propaganda to say that Raila is going to kill the sector. No, that is not the case," he said. Raila's remarks on mitumba clothes caused an uproar on social media on Tuesday. While unveiling his manifesto at Nyayo Stadium Monday night, the ODM leader remarked that mitumba clothes worn by Kenyans could, have been worn by people who are already dead. “Our people are only wearing clothes coming from outside the country already worn by people who are dead," Raila said. Raila said he will seek to promote the local fabric industry by giving mitumba importers first priority in marketing locally manufactured clothes. “I’m saying that we are not moving anybody out of business. We will ensure that those who are importing mitumba get the first hand to market goods which are going to be manufactured here in this country," he said
