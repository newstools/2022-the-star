A digital accelerator firm, Africa Digital Media Institute (ADMI) has partnered with Japan's LunaTone to offer paid placements for local students. The Digital Content Apprenticeship deal signed yesterday in Nairobi will also see ADMI students benefit from masterclasses remote work assignments and an incubator. In turn, it helps augment talent in the Japanese industry which is experiencing a severe shortage of skilled professionals. According to ADMI chairman Laila Macharia, It is estimated that the shortage of tech workers will reach 85 million by 2030 at the time African countries are facing an unemployment challenge. ''We believe that with targeted skilling and support, Africa’s youth can bridge the global talent gap,'' Macharia said. Last year the United Nations estimated that 60 per cent of the youth population across Africa are unemployed. "Africa has the world’s youngest population, with a median age of 19.7 years. Such a large youthful population might ordinarily symbolize an ample and energetic workforce, a boon for the development prospects of any region,'' United Nations' Africa Renewal Magazine said. Even so,  Baro Hyun, LunaTone Founder and CEO believes that technology provides a platform that can help Africa bridge the unemployment gap. He believes that such partnerships will also help the world bridge a wide skills gap as the digital revolution takes shape. According to the International Labour Organisation, there is a large 'skills gap' in relation to problem-solving, with employers giving it an important factor score of 96, but a satisfaction factor score of just 67. “The partnership will mentor creatives to serve the Japanese digital content sector by producing viable commercial games and other animated and extended reality content,'' Hyun said. He added that it will also introduce Japanese companies to Africa, not just as a market for products and services, but also as a talent pipeline.
