Deputy President William Ruto has now divulged that his agreement with ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula was not his own creation. The DP who spoke in Kakamega's Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega county, on Sunday said he gave the two leaders a leeway to propose what they want even as he expressed commitment to oblige. "Even the agreement that we signed with Mudavadi and Wetangula, I gave them the opportunity to say what they want since I was ready to grant their request," the DP said. "The two leaders had even suggested that they will deliver 95 percent of the Western Kenya votes. But I told them no, let's put it at 70 per cent...." The agreement between the DP and the two leaders indicates that Western Kenya has to deliver 70 percent of its total votes to stand a chance of getting a 30 per cent share of the government. However, leaders from the Western region have exuded confidence that they will deliver 90 per cent of the votes. Led by Kenya Kwanza Alliance governor candidate Senator Cleophas Malala, the leaders said they will deliver more than 70 per cent set for them. Malala reminded the DP that they are sure of delivering the votes and asked him to remember honouring the 30 per cent pledge he offered the Western region. "As the people of the Western region, we are able to give more than 70 percent of the votes instead we shall deliver 90 per cent," Malala said at the church service that the DP also attended. "As long as you do not disappoint in honouring your 30 percent to us."
