Budding setter Emmaculate Nekesa has vowed to step up and fill the void left by retired long-serving Malkia strikers' setter Jane Wacu who exited the stage last week after 16 years of selfless service. Nekesa, 19, plays for Kenya Commercial Bank and has become regular for the bankers. She helped them to the African Club Championship gong last month in Tunisia. ''I am more than ready to fill the void left by Wacu, who has been my mentor. Though the gap is massive, I believe I have what it takes to make the position my own even though there's cut-throat competition." Wacu, 37, will continue with her club career in Seychelles but will also channel her energy into coaching as she keeps alive her dream of coaching Malkia one day. "Nekesa for me has everything. She listens and has the hunger and drive to succeed," said Wacu when asked about her possible replacement. However, the position is expected to be hotly contested with the likes of Pipeline's Esther Mutinda and Kenya Defence Forces' Veronicah Kilabat also lining up for it. Malkia coach Paul Bitok has tipped Nekesa to join the national ranks after her match-winning heroics in Tunisia. Nekesa was a trialist for the Tokyo Olympic Games and she is part of the 18-member squad expected in Brazil this week for a two-month training ahead of the World Championships. "I am on top of the game at the moment. My confidence has improved and with the trust of the coaches, the sky is the limit. The Brazil camp will help bring the best out of me."
