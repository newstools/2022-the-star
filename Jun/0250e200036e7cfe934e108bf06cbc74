Rowland Babu Makati is excited after making his Kenyan Premier League debut for Nairobi City Stars. The youthful forward made his top-flight bow against AFC Leopards in Thika Stadium in the game that ended 1-1. Makati came on in the 63rd minute for Mohammed Omar Bajaber who had earned his first Premier League game. “I am happy that finally, I am a Premier League player. Patience has brought me this far and now that the debut has come, I want to earn more games and work even harder to feature in many more,” he told the club’s official portal. Prior to the debut, Makati made the bench three times, the first in mid-December against KCB, and twice in May against Kenya Police and Gor Mahia. Speaking on Makati’s achievement, head coach Nicholas Muyoti said he hopes the former Escalator FC lad can replicate what he saw against Leopards in the season-ender against FC Talanta on Sunday. “Makati did well in his first match in the Premier League. Let’s hope he does better in the final match.” Makati joined Simba Wa Nairobi in August 2020 from third-tier side Vapor Sports on a long-term deal. He spent the entire 2020/21 season on loan at second-tier side Nairobi Stima, where he scored five goals and provided seven assists. At the same time, exciting forward Mohammed Omar Bajaber is angling for more game time at City Stars. “I am glad to have made my first start in the topflight and I am hoping I will have many more to come.” “I want to thank the coaches for having the trust in me to deliver. It is unfortunate though that we did not win in that particular game but I am happy to have contributed to the goal,” said Bajaber. His first start came a week after he was left on the bench during matchday 32 against Gor Mahia in Kasarani. His debut came in mid-May against Tusker in Ruaraka when he substituted Nicholas Kipkirui five minutes to time. He was to substitute the same player at halftime in the next game against KCB in his second game.
