A Kenya National Bureau of Statistics report released on May 5 laid bare runaway crime countrywide. The Economic Survey 2022 indicates stealing, criminal damage and dangerous drugs were spiralling out of control. The chilling and dreadful robbery of a woman in Ongata Rongai is a stark reminder that the police have a mountain to climb to rein in criminals. It exposed the security system's soft underbelly and brought to our sitting rooms the reality we have always known all along—we are virtually at the mercy of gangs. The young men in the CCTV footage were well prepared. They were calm. Confident no one would interrupt their deplorable scheme. The rising cost of living has made the already volatile situation even worse. If a well-to-do city resident can suffer such a debilitating attack, we are left to wonder what the poorer parts of the city live through. The Rongai armed robbery is just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands such atrocities never capture our public imagination and our sense of horror because they hardly reach the media. In a country aiming to run a 24-hour economy, there is a need for the government to guarantee the safety of Kenyans at all times. To curb runaway crime, the police must do what they are trained to do—deploy boots on the ground. There are far too many strong men and women wasting away at the traffic unit and pushing paper at decrepit offices as thugs take control of our lives.
