Deputy President William Ruto's car was on Sunday stoned by a group of youths as his entourage made its way into Jacaranda grounds in Embakasi. The incident happened within Soweto slums which borders the grounds in Embakasi East constituency. The DP, who is the UDA presidential candidate, was going to address a Kenya Kwanza political rally at the venue. The event was initially marred by violent encounters that resulted in injuries before police restored order. Ruto dismissed the chaos as political machinations orchestrated by his competitors who have sensed defeat at the August 9 general election. "All these intimidation you are seeing is because they want to force us but no amount of bullets, no amount of intimidation, no amount of stones, no amount of threats will stop this nation from changing," Ruto said. "On the night of August, we are going to change this nation for them better," he added. The DP said his Kenya Kwanza government will put to an end the culture of politicians using the youth to disrupt opponents' political rallies. He said the youth easily fall for the ploy because of joblessness which his government will end by creating job opportunities. "The days of suing the youth to throw stones will end with this election. No youth will be used by anyone anymore to hurt others because of politics," Ruto said. He challenged those behind the chaos to prove their might at the ballot on voting day. "Meet us at the ballot, stop this violence, stop the intimidation, stop the blackmail. We are going to change this country whether you like it or not," Ruto said. Earlier in the day, a stand-off ensued between security agents and Kenya Kwanza Alliance brigade after the officers stopped organisers the rally would not go on over security concerns. Police said they had received intelligence goons planned to raid the rally and cause harm to people. Several people were injured in a clash between the Kenya Kwanza brigade and goons.
