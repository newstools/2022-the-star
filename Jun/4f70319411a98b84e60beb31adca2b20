Over 170 golfers converge this weekend for the 10th Safaricom Golf Tour this weekend at the par 73 Kitale Golf Course. The Kitale leg will precede a caddies tournament on Monday. The event has attracted golfers from as far as Nandi Bears, Kakamega, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kericho with the senior tournament scheduled for Saturday and juniors on Sunday. Lydia Jebichii, the overall winner of the fourth leg in Nyanza and Faith Chemutai, both from Nandi Bears, are among the top golfers who have confirmed their participation. Sunday’s junior tourney will also feature golf clinics, where the aspiring junior golfers will get an opportunity to learn new skills from various trainers as has been the case in the past nine legs. The Safaricom Golf Tour has so far visited Kericho, Nanyuki, Limuru, Muthaiga, Nyanza, Machakos, Eldoret, Karen, Nyali and Kericho drawing over 4,800 golfers in the tournaments, junior clinics and outreach programmes. “We are pleased that our series continues to attract great participation from across the country, especially with the junior golfers taking part in both the competition and golf clinics. This leg will also have the caddies tournament which speaks to what we set out to achieve at the onset of this series which is to give all those interested a chance to participate in the tournament,” said Safricom CEO Peter Ndegwa.
