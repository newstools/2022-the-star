Despite edging out Trail Blazers 3-2 (25-20,19-25, 22-25, 25-22, 11-15) in the Kenya Volleyball Federation men’s league at the Nyayo Stadium, on Sunday, the General Service Unit coach Gideon Tarus believes minor mistakes in blocking and reception are still proving detrimental to his charges’ title defence. The serial winning tactician added that even though the team had minimised their errors, which saw them humiliated 3-0 by Kenya Ports Authority KPA on Friday, players must rediscover their magic charm to prevail in the last leg slated for the same venue this weekend. “We took a lot of risks today since we were prepared for any outcome. The players looked composed after the mauling by KPA but we conceded easy points and made life difficult for ourselves. We were not prepared to play outdoor but we can build on the win,” said Tarus. Kenya Defence Forces slew Vihiga County in straight sets of 29-27, 25-21 and 25-12, condemning the Western-based side to their eighth loss of the season. Vihiga have a meagre three points they recorded in Friday’s walkover against Central Prisons but the team remains a work in progress according to coach Sammy Mugata. “The team rarely trains together and the financial inadequacies have taken a toll on us. This is a new team with the potential to become even better,” said Mugata. Elsewhere, Kenya Forest Service (KFS) boosted their playoff chances by hammering Nairobi Prisons.3-0 (25-21,25-17,25-22). KPA and GSU are guaranteed playoff slots while the remaining two places are up for grabs.
