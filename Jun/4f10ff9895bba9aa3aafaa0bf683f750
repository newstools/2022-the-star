Comedian Henry Desagu has not been actively producing content like before as he is planning to start charging for some of his content. In a recent interview with Presenter Ali, Desagu assured fans he isn't going anywhere yet. "Doing comedy is just like doing business. You must generate content that will make money," he said. "When you start your business, you must give it all your attention. And the purpose of our art is to make money, so even if you are making content, kuna mahali unafikanga, you have to focus." Desagu said he is intentional on whether the kind of content he is releasing is bringing income. He plans to create a website where the content he puts will be paid for. "Actually, it's Njugush who gave me the idea. So there will be free content on my YouTube and then on my website, there will be content fans will pay for," he said. He explained the need to sell content. "I will be doing this because maze, I am getting old. It gets to a point where you take a step back and rethink and see what new things to do. You see, I've been shooting for six years every week." In the interview, Desagu was mum about his dating life, saying he has no plans to put it in the limelight. "I will hide my woman just like the retired President, the late Mzee Moi," he said. "Did you ever see his wife? He kept quiet about it for 24 years, so why do you want the Prince of Mwihoko to tell you about his woman? "When I'm the king, then and only then will you see my queen. But when you are a prince like me, labda natafutiwa, mambo inaagaliwa vizuri."
