Strathmore University downed Platinum Eldonets 84-52 in a Kenya  National Basketball League (KNBL) men’s Premier League tie at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on Sunday. This was the students' third win in as many games in their best possible start after beating Thunder 76-69 and Umoja 73-65. For the Uasin Gishu County side, it was two losses on the trot after going down 66-53 to former national champions Ulinzi Warriors the previous day. “We were fatigued after yesterday’s (Saturday) game against Ulinzi; considering that we have not also trained well,” said Eldonets star guard James Omweno. “We are also working on new systems of play that we are still mastering. In a few weeks time, with some more trainings, we will be ok.” Eldonets had a poor opening, trailing 26-8 and 18-5 in the first two quarters. They pulled up 28-16 in the third and were down again 24-11 in the last. Robert Odhiambo and Brandon Otieno each sunk 12 points for the Blades while Omweno connected 14 for Eldonets. In a women’s Premier League tie, Jkuat beat fellow promoted side Eldonets 46-31. Sophia Omenda and Elsie Akinyi combined for the winners 15 points while Stacey Ongwae notched the visitors’ 11. “This was a sweet revenge mission after they beat us 3-1 in the play-off finals last year. I am happy with the result,” said students coach Mary Chepkoi In the Lower Division matches, Jkuat pipped Little Prince  52-44 as Kenya College of Accountancy hit western Delight 54-45.
