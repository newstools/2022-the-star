Police had Wednesday morning during a security mission to enable an auctioneer to recover Sh4.9 million stumbled upon 22 assorted guns and more than 500 bullets in a shocking discovery. "Detectives from the DCI Anti-terror police unit (ATPU) have launched a manhunt for a suspect in whose house an armoury stocked with a cache of lethal firearms and hundreds of ammunition was recovered, in Nairobi’s Kilimani area" "The suspect who has since gone into hiding is wanted and has 24 hours to surrender to the nearest DCI offices. Should you have any information on his whereabouts, please dial 0800 722 203," Kinoti said. Ken Okello is the proprietor of Vic. Technologies Limited and had for a long time failed to pay his monthly rent prompting the landlord, Ballon Wanjala Nangalama, to seek a court order allowing him to break into the premises. Accompanied by Kilimani-based police officers, Hebros auctioneers gained entry into the premises, and a quick search revealed an armoury, stocked with an assortment of weapons of different calibers and hundreds of ammunition. "Detectives have since established that the suspect was a licensed firearm dealer but his license was suspended over 3 years ago." Items recovered during the operation included; nine escort magnum short guns, one Benelli short gun, five Guatro short guns, one savage short gun, six Walter pistols, and a total of 565 ammunition of assorted different calibers. Police said they also found 25 pistol holsters, dozens of magazine carriers, 30 slings, ten sniper torches and a certificate of registration as a firearm dealer. The team also found a firearm movement register and assorted firearm manuals.
