A political rally in Matungu, Kakamega county, exposed the simmering rivalry between parties making up the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The political bromance exhibited by Former Senator Cleophas Malala and his predecessor Boni Khalwale in past rallies was nowhere to be seen at their joint rally on Tuesday. The two were embroiled in a standoff that resulted in a war of words. Their differences played out in the open after Khalwale failed to endorse  Malala for the governor's seat. The ex-senator had implored residents to elect whoever they want for any seat saying they are all residents of Kakamega County. He, however, campaigned for his senatorial bid as he left the option open for residents to choose between Malala and ODM candidate Fernandes Barasa in the governor seat race. "My people, I am Khalwale. I want you to know that I come from Kakamega, Malala comes from Kakamega and Fernandes from Kakamega," he said. "All of us are seeking seats. Weigh us and pick whoever you want for any seat. Choose one who will care for you. Remember Khalwale is the best legislator in Kenya. " Barasa and Malala are perceived to be frontrunners in the race to succeed the incumbent Wycliffe Oparanya. The remarks did not augur well with Malala who took to the podium lashing out at the senator. "What is he saying now. He is confused. Stop being confused. This is my stronghold. If you have started eating from both sides of the political divide, say." The standoff came just two days after the two held a joint rally in Bukhungu stadium where they hosted Kenya Kwanza Presidential candidate William Ruto. Their top Luhya leaders in the coalition Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula were present. Khalwale who spoke at the rally downplayed the existence of any feud among the Kenya Kwanza parties in the region.
