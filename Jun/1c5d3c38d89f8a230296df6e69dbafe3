President Uhuru Kenyatta 0n Monday launched the DCI national forensic laboratory. The facility is expected to fast-track investigations of serious crimes, including terrorism, murder, robbery with violence, cyber-crime and rape, among others. The forensic lab is also expected to help unravel difficult cases that have been difficult to crack. Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti said every attempt to build the lab was marred by corruption, gobbling up billions of shillings that went to the pockets of a few, thereby killing the dream of Kenyan taxpayers. The launched Laboratory was a project under Vision 2030 and one of the projects to be completed under the 1st Medium Term plan of 2008-2012. The project aimed at boosting Kenya's capabilities to fight complex crimes through interventions such as DNA profiling; weapons and ballistics testing; and document examination. Suprime Court judge Njoki Ndung'u, Chief Justice Martha Koome, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki, Cabinet Secretary for Sports Amina Mohamed among other leaders were presenr at the launch.
