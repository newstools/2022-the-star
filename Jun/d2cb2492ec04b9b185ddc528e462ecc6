A Canadian NGO has lauded Vihiga county for the success of Baba na Mama Anzilisha programme. The programme started in 2019 by Nutrition International seeks to cut down maternal mortality rates that were alarming within remote areas of the county. Governor Wilber ottichilo while addressing residents at Essaba dispensary thanked the NGO saying it has been of the great help to Vihiga people. Ottichilo also appreciated couples who enrolled in the programme for their commitment and playing a pivotal role in improving the well being of mother and child health. Speaking on Saturday while meeting the project members from Luanda subcounty, the governor said maternal and child death rates have drastically reduced following initiation of the project. “Before we started this programme, we used to record high numbers of deaths involving mothers and their young ones at birth. As we speak now, the rate has reduced and for instance, last year we only lost one mother,” he said. Ottichilo said the programme is a partnership between Vihiga county and Canada's Nutrition International. Department of Health acting CECM Inonda Mwanje said implementation of the project has been a success in the county and this has encouraged the NGO to roll it out in other counties. Health Services chief officer Mary Anyienda appreciated Nutrition International for their continued support, adding that the programme has gone a long way in ensuring expectant mothers get the necessary attention. The governor had earlier on had an engagement with Baba Na Mama Anzilisha project members from Emuhaya subcounty.
