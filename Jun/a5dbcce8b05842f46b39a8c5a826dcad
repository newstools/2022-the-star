Fresh from winning the Rabat Diamond League in Morocco, world Under- 18 400m silver medallist, Mary Moraa, has predicted a tough race at the Roma Diamond League this evening in Rome, Italy. The former Mogonga High School student said she feels ready for the challenge and she is not worried about the big names present. “I hope to give the race my best shot and I am not afraid of anyone," said Moraa. On Sunday, Moraa won her maiden Diamond League title in Rabat in a personal best of 1:58.93 ahead of the Rome meeting. She said she is relishing the challenge, adding that the tougher the race the better for her. “If an athlete runs or competes with the best, she or he is bound to post good results and best time. With such a great lineup, I am sure I will post good times in Italy,” she added. She beat  South African Prudence Sekgodiso (1:59.23)  and French international Renelle Lamote(1:59.83) to second and third places respectively. “I have been working hard to earn the World Championship qualifying time and I am happy I did it in Rabat. This was a nice race for me,” she said. Moraa and Olympic Games semifinalist Lamote will be renewing their rivalry in Rome. However, they face a stiffer challenge from double Olympic Games champion Athing Mu from the United States. Mu won the 800m title in Tokyo last year in her best time of 1:55.04 as well as the 4x400m relay gold. Ugandan world 800m champion, Halimah Nakaayi will also be in the mix. Nakaayi won a bronze at the Africa Games and World Indoor. Also expected are—Great Britain’s Olympic Games finalist Jemma Reekie (1:56.90), Polish international Aneta Lemiesz (I:59.93), Cuban Pan-Africa Games 800m champion Rosemary Almanza, Italian Mediterranean U-23 champion Elena Bello (2:00.39) and Australian and world relays 2x2x400m relay silver medalist Bisset Catriona (1:58.09). Others are World Championships finalist Lindsay Butterworth (Canada),   Olympic Games finalists Natoya Goule (Jamaica), and World Indoor silver medallist, Ethiopia's Freweyn Hailu (1:57.57). In the 3,000m steeplechase, Commonwealth Games 3,000m bronze medalist Abraham Kibiwott is a doubt after picking back injury ahead of the African Senior Athletics Championships in Reduit, Mauritius. However, a former World Under-20  champion Leonard Bett will be lining up against compatriots Conseslus Kipruto, Wilberforce Chemiat Kones, and World Under-20 3,000m steeplechase champion Amos Serem and Lawrence Kemboi Kipsang. After winning the Kip Keino Classic, Jacob Krop will be lining up against teammates Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli and Levy Kibet in the 5,000m race.
