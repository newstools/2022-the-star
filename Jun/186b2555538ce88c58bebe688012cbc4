Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua will on Friday traverse Kitui county to drum up support for her coalition ahead of the August 9 polls. Karua is accompanied by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and other Azimio leaders. She will keep the campaign momentum rolling in the absence of presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Ukambani kingpin Kalonzo Musyoka who are both out of the country. The Narc Kenya leader will start off at Kamutei at around 11 am before heading to Zombe, where she's expected to arrive at noon. The campaign caravan is expected to make stops at Mutitu around 1 pm before proceeding to Kwa Vonza at 2 pm. "Welcome to Kitui County Madam Deputy President," Ngilu said in a tweet. The latest opinion poll indicates that Raila has edged past his main competitor, DP William Ruto, in the presidential race in what partly appears linked to his choice of Karua as his running mate. The poll by Infotrak, one of Kenya's major research firms, indicates Ruto's popularity has slumped to 38 per cent against Raila's 42 per cent. On Thursday, Karua was in Mombasa for Maendeleo ya Wanawake's 70th-anniversary celebrations. "When women work and do business, the economy is more productive and diverse. Azimio will achieve this by ensuring women are equal players in the markets, have access to decent work and productive resources, and participate in decision making," she said. She was accompanied by Gender CS Margaret Kobia, Nyeri Deputy Governor Carol Karugu and Likoni MP Mishi Mboko among other leaders.
