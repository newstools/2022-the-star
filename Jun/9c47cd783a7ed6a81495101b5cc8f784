NPR reports that Facebook's parent company Meta has announced new parental supervision measures for Instagram and its virtual reality headset. Meta says the new nudge is designed to encourage teens to discover something new and “excludes certain topics that may be associated with appearance comparison.” Meta plans to roll out the tools globally before the end of the year.
