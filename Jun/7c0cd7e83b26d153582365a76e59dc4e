The National Police Service has stared training police officers on election management in readiness for the August 9 polls. The service says the training is aimed at building the capabilities and capacity of the officers in handling issues related to the general election. "Earlier today, two such training sessions were held in Kangema and Kahuro subcounties," NPS said in a tweet on Saturday. The general election is 51 days away. Police officers play an integral part in the election process by providing security during the entire electioneering process. Officers from different cadres are usually deployed to maintain order at polling centres and guard voting material. The training they are undertaking includes a walk-through-talk-through session on the duties of security officers before, during, and after the elections. They are also being taught how to identify and handle election-related offenses and how to maintain peace and order at polling centers. The officers are also being familiarised with election-related laws by being taken through the code of conduct that guides the relationship and cooperation with the IEBC and other stakeholders during the process. "The NPS would like to assure the public of its preparedness to play its constitutional mandate and therefore create a peaceful and secure environment," NPS said.
