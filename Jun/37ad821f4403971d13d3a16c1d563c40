Kenya Kwanza presidential running mate Rigathi Gachagua has hit out at Azimio Presidential Candidate Raila Odinga saying he is using his running mate Martha Karua as bait to fish for votes. Speaking during a rally at Nyandarua County, he maintained that the Alliance has the most support in the area and urged the electorates not to back Raila for the top seat. "President Uhuru Kenyatta kept away from campaigns so Raila went to pick our sister Karua from Kirinyaga so that he can confuse you to give him votes. Can that get you confused ?" he asked. He said the contest is between his boss DP  William Ruto and Raila, not him and Karua. Gachagua said the Azimio leaders will need to humble themselves and ask for forgiveness from the people of the region if they want their votes. He claimed that the Coalition sent goons to the area to coerce votes. "Kama njia yako ya kutafuta kura ni kutumia huyu dada yetu atembee hapa alafu mnatuma watu wapige vijana, hakuna kura mtapata hapa, hata moja," he said. This loosely translates to: "If your way of searching for votes is sending our sister to visit this place and send people to beat our youths, you are not getting any votes here, not even one". He added: "We want to tell Uhuru, that we love and respect you so stop disrespecting us by endorsing Raila." The Mathira MP said the problem facing Kenyans is lack of employment for young people and lack of business start-up capital. He said if Ruto wins the presidency, the government will fix the agricultural status of the Nyandarua people in the first six months. Gachagua was accompanied by MPs Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Patrick Mariru (Laikipia West), Faith Gitau (Nyandarua) and Michael Muchira (Oll Joro Orok).
