Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has expressed commitment to remain in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance despite simmering sibling rivalry threatening the unity of the coalition. The MP made the commitment after attending the alliance's Nairobi county economic meeting on Tuesday. During the meeting, Kuria drummed up support for Deputy President William Ruto and aspirants from the alliance who are seeking elective seats in Nairobi. His attendance came in the wake of speculations that he could bolt out of Kenya Kwanza Alliance after he and Tujibebe party leader William Kabogo announced they will not be a party to UDA campaigns. The two leaders accused the UDA of bias and intimidation even as they claimed the Ruto-led outfit has resolved to "kill" Mt Kenya parties. Kuria and Kabogo expressed fears the Mt Kenya region might suffer politically in the event the trend continues. "It is clear from the foregoing that a decision has been made by some quarters that parties with a strong footing in Mt Kenya region are not wanted in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance," the two added in their statement dated June 16. "It is instructive to note that whereas The Service Party and its leader Hon. Mwangi Kiunjuri were subjected to the same embarrassment on June 11, 2022, at Nyahururu and Nanyuki in front of coalition leaders Dr William Samoei Ruto, Hon, Moses Kuria and Hon JB Muturi."
