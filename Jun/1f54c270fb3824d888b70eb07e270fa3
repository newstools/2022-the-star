The third round of the 2022 National Sevens Circuit, dubbed Driftwood, received a Sh2 million boost from Kenya Breweries Limited ahead of the event this weekend. KBL through its flagship, Tusker, also sponsored the just concluded George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial Sevens, which kicked off the National Rugby Sevens Circuit and Christie Sevens to a tune of Sh8 million. Both events were held at the RFUEA Grounds in Nairobi. The tournament which is being hosted by Mombasa RFC is set to feature some of the top Sevens teams in the circuit. They include the circuit’s leaders Strathmore Leos who will headline Pool A by virtue of their win in the second round at the Christie 7s in Nairobi.  They will be up against Impala, Homeboyz, and hosts Mombasa. Reigning national champions and Driftwood 7s title holders KCB, are in Pool 'B'  alongside Kabras Sugar, Daystar Falcons, and JumiaPay Pirates while Menengai Oilers, Kenya Harlequin, Topfry Nakuru, and Blak Blad make up Pool C. Western Bulls are top seeds in a Pool D that also includes Mwamba, Nondescripts, and the Zetech Oaks who won the division two competition at the Christie 7s. EABL Coast Divisional sales manager representative, Zipporah Ngendo, said the company was delighted to once again sponsor the tournament. “KBL is delighted to sponsor this year’s Driftwood Sevens which comes just a few weeks after we sponsored the first two rounds of the National Sevens Circuit. "Rugby continues to be an important platform through which we engage with our consumers and therefore, remain committed to supporting the sport and this sponsorship speaks to this commitment. "This sponsorship will no doubt go a long way towards ensuring the event’s success and we look forward to it.” Mombasa RFC Chairman Rogers Lai thanked the Kenya Breweries for the sponsorship.
