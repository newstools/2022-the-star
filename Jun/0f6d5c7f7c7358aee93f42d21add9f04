At an event to sign the bipartisan gun control bill into law, President Joe Biden makes further remarks on the Supreme Court's seismic abortion ruling. "I know how painful and devastating the decision is for so many Americans," he says. Asked whether the court is a broken institution, Biden replies: "I think the Supreme Court has made some terrible decisions." Earlier in the week, he criticised a separate ruling that would loosen gun restrictions in the state of New York. The Biden administration is under pressure to act to protect abortion access, but there is little the president can unilaterally do. "My administration is going to focus on how [states] administer [their abortion bans] and if they violate other laws by deciding not to allow people to cross state lines to get to public health services," he says. Following the ruling, clinics have begun closing in some US states after a Supreme Court ruling on Friday removed American women's constitutional right to abortion. About half of the states are expected to introduce new restrictions or bans after the court overturned its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision. Of these 13 have outlawed abortion instantly. President Joe Biden had described the ruling as "a tragic error".
