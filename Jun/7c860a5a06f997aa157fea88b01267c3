Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga will on Sunday take the Azimio la Umoja gospel to Kiambu county. This comes a day after he stormed Meru county accompanied by his running mate Martha Karua and leaders allied to the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition. He is expected to woo the county that is deemed Deputy President William Ruto's stronghold to vote for him in the August 9 General election. Kiambu is also President Uhuru Kenyatta's home county. The former Prime minister has intensified campaigns in the Mt Kenya region, which has dismally voted for him in the previous General elections. Meanwhile DP Ruto will be in Nairobi where he is expected to hold a mega rally at the Jacaranda grounds with his Kenya Kwanza counterparts. The rally is set to begin from 12 noon. "The Kenya Kwanza fraternity and the entire hustler nation wishes a blessed Sunday to all na tukutane Jacaranda after church," Ruto tweeted on Sunday morning. Before the rally, the second in command will attend a church service at Jesus Winners in Roysambu. He has also intensified campaigns in areas perceived to be Raila's strongholds.
