Instead of sending a million “Sorry, typing error”, WhatsApp has announced it will soon bring an editing feature for sent text messages. According to WABetaInfo, the feature is already under development, and the outlet has a screenshot to prove it, showing an "edit" option for a sent message in WhatsApp for Android. You will only need to long-press the sent message you want to edit, and a three-dot menu pops up which will include an option of copying, editing, or info. The firm has said it is unclear whether messages will be editable forever or within a certain time window. Here once you edit, you can be able to resend the message. It will available on WhatsApp for iOS, as well as the app's desktop version first. However, it is expected to come to Android later on. Currently, users have an option to delete, re-write and resend new text messages.
