The detectives have unmasked a suspect who allegedly shot and killed a man and woman at Adams Market in Nairobi. The suspect's face was captured on the CCTV footage as he terrorised the woman during a robbery incident that happened on Saturday. Police suspect the man is one of the thugs that have been targeting Mpesa shops in Nairobi and its environs. "The thug is part of a wider armed and dangerous gang that staged an attack at Mpesa shops located at Adams market. Two people were shot dead in the Saturday incident," police said. Those killed have been identified as Sophia Gathoni Maina, 53, and Paul Githinji Gitau, 50 although, they are not related. Gathoni was shot at her shop while Githinji was hit outside as he responded to screams from the woman. Gathoni succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday, three days after the incident, while Githinji died on the spot. In the CCTV footage, the man is seen attacking Gathoni who tried to defend herself in vain. The man is seen following her to her shop in a confrontation before he opened fire. An accomplice tried to force himself into the shop but Gathoni fought back and got out. The gunman then shot her at least two times. The gang, which witnesses told police that they were three, ran out of the shop as the deceased screamed for help. She had been hit in the hand and chest.
