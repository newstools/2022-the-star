About 176 Class 8 leavers are yet to enrol in secondary schools in Murang’a county. A total of 13,162 boys have enrolled, compared with 12,903 girls who have joined secondary schools, county Education director Ann Kiilu said. With the county attaining a 96 per cent transition rate, Murang’a South has been identified as the area with the highest number of students who have not transitioned to secondary schools. Kiilu said her office will partner with security officers and local administrators to raise the transition rate to 100 per cent. “Officers from the Ministry of Education will work with chiefs and assistant chiefs to identify students who are yet to join secondary schools and ensure they do as it is their right,” she said. The director warned parents against breaching the government’s directive, reiterating its commitment to ensure all children access secondary school education. Her office will receive the assistance from National Government Administrative Officers and will liaise with primary school head teachers to pinpoint the homes of the unaccounted for children. “It is unfortunate that more girls are yet to join secondary schools and the ministry is working to ensure they are all enrolled,” Kiilu said. About 260 others who sat their KCPE exam this year have enrolled in vocational training centres while 78 others are repeating Class 8. Five students died. "I am appealing to all stakeholders to work with my office to ensure all learners who should have joined secondary schools are found and enrolled,” Kiilu said. (Edited by V. Graham)
