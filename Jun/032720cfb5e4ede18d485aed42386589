Nairobi gubernatorial candidate Polycarp Igathe will on Wednesday know if his name will be on the ballot when the IEBC Disputes Resolution Tribunal rules on his case. A petitioner, George Bush, lodged a complaint seeking to have Igathe blocked on claims he abdicated his official duties while serving as deputy governor. Bush in his submission averred that he failed to deliver on his mandates having been duly elected as a deputy governor to Mike Sonko in 2017 to 2022. He said after quitting from his position and the subsequent impeachment of Sonko, he subjected city residents to a lot of suffering. Wambua Kilonzo is chairing panel one of the committee which has commissioners Irene Masit and Justus Nyang'aya. A ruling on Muranga UDA governorship candidate Irungu Kang’ata is also set to be issued today. He is accused of asking the returning officer to change the date of presenting his nomination papers to enable him confirm whether his running mate Winnie Njeri had resigned from her job at the University of Nairobi. In his complaint, Thomas Waithaka said the candidate violated the law when he asked the returning officer to alter the nomination date of presentation of his candidature from June 6 to June 7, 2022. Others whose cases are coming up for hearing today are Granton Samboja (Taita Taveta) and Mike Sonko. Nairobi senator Johnson Sakaja is also set to know his fate on Wednesday. The IEBC Disputes Resolution Tribunal is on the fifth day of the hearing of cases raised on qualification of various aspirants.
