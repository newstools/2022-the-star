Police in Nyandarua County are detaining a man suspected of selling dog meat. The man, Ndirangu Wahome, was arrested on Sunday in the Wanjohi area. The arrest came after Kipipiri sub-county chief Margaret Wambui informed police about a man suspected of selling dog meat in her area. Ndirangu is accused of hawking fried dog meat in a hot pot within Wanjohi town. Police acted swiftly and visited the suspect's homestead. Upon searching his compound, a slit dog head, a sufuria which he used to cook the meat, a blood-stained knife and panga were recovered. A wire which he used to trap the dog, about ten grams of cannabis and a live dog which was suspected to be next on the slaughter line were also found at the suspect's home. "There were speculations that Ndirangu's fried dog meat was not genuine and it seems that was true, based on the kind of things that were found at his home," Wambui said. He was placed in custody awaiting arraignment.
