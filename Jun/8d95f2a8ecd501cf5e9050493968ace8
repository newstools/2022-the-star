IEBC on Monday cleared former Kitui governor Julius Malombe to run for the seat on the Wiper ticket. Malombe was given a nod after he won the Sunday repeat Wiper Party nomination that was ordered by the High court last Friday. The former Governor had to battle petitions and court cases in which Kiema Kilonzo who was eyeing the Wiper ticket challenged the party's move to award him a direct ticket. The last of the cases was determined on Friday by Justice Christine Meoli who nullified Malombe’s nomination and ordered repeat nominations within 72 hours. The nomination was consequently held on Sunday and Malombe beat Kilonzo by garnering 9,826 against the latter’s 80. On Monday, Malombe was handed his clearance certificate by the Kitui County IEBC returning officer Macharia Gichichi at the Kitui Multipurpose development and Training Institute. Malombe has called on Kilonzo to accept defeat and support his candidature. “We are advising him to seek an MCA position although I am not sure whether he will win. "Therefore he should not waste the time of the Kitui people anymore. Let him rest and allow them to elect their governor who can serve them,” said Malombe. Malombe noted that his popularity was beyond reproach exuding confidence that he will win the seat. He accused Kilonzo of abusing the court process as he was not a popular candidate. The former governor said he was ready to conduct mature and peaceful campaigns as advised by the returning officer.
