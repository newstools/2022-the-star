Police officers in Webuye, Bungoma have arrested a truck driver, 56, for ferrying 10 sacks of bhang from Uganda to Mombasa. The driver was arrested along Webuye- Malaba road at pan paper area. Webuye East OCPD Martha Ng'etich said she received a tip-off from members of the public. Ng'etich said she called officers from Kakamega who arrested the driver. “After the police inspected the truck they found bhang well tied resembling mitumba sacks and arrested the driver who is currently detained at Webuye police station,” she said on Tuesday. Ng'etich said after the forensic audit from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation department it was realised that the value was estimated at Sh15 million. She lauded the members of the public for raising the alarm. Ng'etich appreciated the good relationship between the police and the members of the public asking them to remain vigilant and report such cases. She warned drivers from associating themselves with ferrying bhang and other stuff against the law. However, she asked traffic officers to be keen, identify naughty drivers and arrest them to serve as an example to others.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
