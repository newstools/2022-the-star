United Democratic Alliance party has requested media houses to deploy female journalists only to cover the signing of the Alliance Women Charter event on Friday. The signing of the Charter will take place at Nyayo National Stadium. " We encourage your Media House/Online News Blog to deploy an all Women Crew as we seek to celebrate and highlight the important role played by women in all sectors," the UDA communication director, Wanjohi Githae said on Thursday. The Charter was launched on Monday in a bid to counter the Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua's wave. During the launch, Deputy President William Ruto said if he is elected president, women will take lead in different positions. He said he will give women 50 percent of the cabinet slots if he wins the top office. “It is true that what a man can do, a woman can do better. From personal experience, I can confirm that there are things that women can do better than men. Therefore, the more we keep them out of leadership positions the more we lose,” he said. The UDA leader added that his party has presented the largest number of women candidates in the upcoming August 9, polls. “UDA will have the most elected women governors. I want to say that for the record. I am sure at least five women governors will be elected on UDA ticket,” he said. Ruto vowed to break the tradition that women are only to be seen, not heard. He acknowledged the support of women countrywide, adding that the opinion polls released so far have backed his faith in women's support.
