The Lake Victoria Basin Commission is prioritising media as accelerator of adaptations to climate change in Lake Basin Region. The LVBC has partnered with the United Nations Environment Programme to train journalists from Kenya, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Rwanda as part of climate actions in Strategic Plan (2022-2026). On Thursday, LVBC’s Executive Secretary,  Bwire Masinde, said the regional media training on adaptation to climate change in Lake Victoria Basin “Is a strategic action consistent with LVBC strategic and programmatic efforts of accelerating adaptations to climate change in the EAC Partner States.” “Media inclusion is timely and strategic. Indeed, it can mobilise actors and accelerate adaptations to climate change in Lake Victoria Basin.” The Regional Coordinator of Adaptation to Climate Change in Lake Victoria Amos Ndoto, applauded the regional media training. “It is our anticipation, that trainees will produce media articles upon return to respective countries,” Ndoto said. The training that will be held from June 27 to 29 in Kigali, Rwanda will cover current interventions by actors in the Lake Victoria Basin, and exposure to LVBC’s programmatic interventions to reverse climate change in EAC Partner States, among others. During the training media practitioners will be equipped with relevant knowledge and empowered to proactively cover climate change-related issues. The Regional Media Training on Adaptation to Climate Change is consistent with development priorities articulated by different policy frameworks at regional and national levels. Part of the expected deliverables of the training aligns with article 7(a) of the EAC Treaty focused on promoting a people-centered EAC regional integration.
