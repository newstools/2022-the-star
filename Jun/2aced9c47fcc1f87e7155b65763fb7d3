Singer Nadia Mukami says she stopped working out after delivery after she hurt herself. Speaking during an interview with Mungai Eve, the mother of one said she had started going to the gym but her CS wound started hurting. "I had to pause and you hear people say I have added weight," she said. "I am not putting pressure on myself. I am exclusively breastfeeding. Other people’s opinions are none of my business. People need to understand that I have a life." Would she ever go through surgery? "I can never say no, I never judge because people go through body transformations or surgeries for different reasons." Nadia, who is working on an album, said her mum is helping her take care of the baby when she is not around.
