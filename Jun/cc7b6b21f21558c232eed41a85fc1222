Deputy President William Ruto has urged Kenyans to remain committed to pushing for the prosperity and unity of the nation as the country marks the 59th Madaraka Day celebrations. In his statement shortly after the Madaraka Day fete ended at the Uhuru Gardens on Wednesday, Ruto reminded Kenyans that the future is in their hands. "Today we celebrate 59 years of Madaraka but we must not forget that we are responsible for the next years ahead, we are the makers of this nation, let us choose a path of progress, unity and prosperity," Ruto said in a statement on Facebook. The DP did not have a chance to address the Madaraka Day celebrations. Only President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Serra Leone counterpart Julius Maada Bio addressed the function. President Uhuru Kenyatta uncharacteristically took over the State address immediately after conferring state investiture to a list of Kenyans. He went on to invite the visiting president who was the chief guest to give his remarks before taking over to give his last Madaraka Day speech as a sitting president.
