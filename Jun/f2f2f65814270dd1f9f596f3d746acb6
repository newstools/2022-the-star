Traders in Kisumu have called upon the police to intensify patrols to prevent shop raids as cases of insecurity escalate. Jamia Supermarket owner Hussein Hassan said they are forced to close early for fear of being attacked after armed thugs assaulted night guards and broke into the shop. A supermarket employee was killed by thugs on his way home from work. Hassan said his CCTV captured four thugs on motorbikes approaching his guards.  They attacked them with crude weapons. “The guards are still nursing panga wounds, one still admitted in hospital with deep cuts on the head,” he said. “This is not the first time that thugs are raiding shops. They raided my neighbour's shop and stole electronics.” Speaking to the press in Kisumu on Wednesday, Hassan urged the security apparatus to address the situation. He said Kisumu requires a 24-hour patrol to nab lawbreakers. Lake Region Bulletin Kisumu journalist Austine Ogalo was recently attacked while heading home in Nyamasaria. He sustained deep cuts on the head. “They were four men. One of them hit me on the back with a plank of wood, and when I turned, another one cut me in the head using a panga before stealing my wallet and phone,” he told the Star. Kisumu City Residents Association chairperson Audi Ogada last week wrote to the Nyanza police commander Karanja Muiruri to address the runaway insecurity in the city. The same week, police arrested 13 suspects linked to the killing of a supermarket employee. County police commander Alphonce Kimanthi confirmed the arrests, saying they have intensified patrol operations. “We have a new Officer Commanding Station. The suspects are in custody,” Kimanthi said. He said they impounded a vehicle and a motorcycle believed to be used by the criminals. “We have heightened up investigations into the incident and the suspects will be taken to court once we are done,” Kimanthi said.
