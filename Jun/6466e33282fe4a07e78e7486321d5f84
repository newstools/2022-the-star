A woman has been given a six-month non-custodial sentence after she pleaded guilty to beating a police officer at Hazina in Starehe subcounty in Nairobi. Makadara chief magistrate Francis Kyambia said Vivian Kwamboka willfully and unlawfully attacked Bernard Kalwe, a police officer, on April 20. According to court records, the officer at the time of the assault was on duty. The court heard that the accused arrived at the report office within Hazina at around 11pm and found the complainant and a colleague who were on duty. She then demanded to see her husband, claiming to have seen the complainant arresting him earlier in the day. The court heard that the officers explained to the accused that the report office had no holding cells and directed her to the Industrial Area police station. When she refused, the officers told her to go home since it was late at night. However, the prosecution said Kwamboka moved to the counter of the report office and grabbed the complainant’s little finger and bit it. The court heard that it took the intervention of the police who were on patrol to  free the complainant from Kwamboka. Kwamboka was then booked for the offence before being taken to court.
