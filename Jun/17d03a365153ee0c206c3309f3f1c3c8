The Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council has put in place measures to eradicate tsetse flies killing livestock and wildlife in the Mara  ecosystem. According to KENTTEC, there has been a tremendous decrease of tsetse flies in Mara ecosystem due to its collaborative effort with conservancies. Tsetse flies cause trypanosomiasis in livestock (Nagana) and sleeping sickness in human beings, which can be fatal when not treated. Speaking in Ol Kinyei conservancy in Mara, council's CEO Pamela Olet said continuous efforts in combating tsetse flies have led to reduction in flies’ density, a boost to tourism and livestock farming in the area. Olet said there  has been no recorded case of sleeping sickness in the recent past, adding that KENTTEC will continue working in the area to maintain the situation. Olet urged the Kenyan and Tanzanian governments to ensure that Mara belt is tsetse free because of the transboundary threat. Bogoria/Narok regional coordinator Sylvia Korir said KENTTEC has made huge strides in tsetse control in Narok county. A 2017 survey by KENTTEC showed the area had a catch of 34 fly per trap per day, while the latest survey in 2021 shows a decrease to 3.4 flies per trap per day. This has been realised through partnership between farmers who often spray their livestock, conservancies and KENTTEC. Ol Kinyei conservancy senior warden Simon Bwete said overtime, the tsetse fly has been a menace in the area causing disturbance to wildlife, livestock and tourists. Bwete added that deployment of over 1,000 tiny targets has helped reduce the tsetse fly density.
