Nyeri Town MP Ngunjiri Wambugu has said Mt Kenya leaders allied to Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition will not use Raila Odinga's photos on their campaign posters. He said it is a political strategy that candidates in the larger Mt Kenya region are employing as they want to be elected in August polls based on their manifestos and not a party. Speaking at a presser on Thursday, Ngunjiri explained that aspirants were trying to distinguish themselves from the Azimio presidential candidate by selling their individual agenda. Ngunjiri said candidates did not want to be elected because of Raila but rather because of their own manifestos. "We want people to be elected based on their own personal standing so that we do not get confused. We are trying to generate that aspect of personal responsibility," he said. "We do not want to confuse voters by hiding behind certain people." Wambugu further said having a party leader on a poster was not proof enough to portray loyalty to the party. However, he insisted that they were still popularising Raila's presidential bid, adding that their strategy was working to their advantage. “We are selling our presidential candidate but this time, compared to 2017, there is a distinction. This is because in 2017, there were people who got elected because of President Uhuru Kenyatta but immediately they got into office, they started undermining him," he said.
