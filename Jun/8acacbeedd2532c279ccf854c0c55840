Willy Ambaka and Sammy Oliech have joined the Kenya Sevens team ahead of next month's Commonwealth Games. Ambaka, who plies his trade for St Petersburg-based Narvskaya Zastava in Russia, last played for the Shujaa during last year's Olympic Games in Tokyo. He has been out injured for the past three months but has recovered in good time for the Club Games. Oliech suffered an Achilles injury last year, missing out on the Olympics. He did play for his club side during the Kenya Cup season and will be eyeing a place in the final 12-man squad. Ambaka said he was delighted to join the side. “It's an honour to be recalled to the national side and I am looking forward to improving on my fitness and gain selection to the Commonwealth and Rugby World Cup Sevens," said Ambaka. Head coach Damian McGrath said no one is guaranteed selection in the squad for the Club Games, slated for Birmingham in the United Kingdom next month. "No one has a guaranteed ticket to the Commonwealth Games. I know there are a lot of great players in Kenya and anyone who puts up their hand and puts up a good performance in the national circuit over the next few weeks will stand a chance. They have to prove their worth," he said. The English-born tactician said the next six weeks will be crucial in laying a foundation, not only for the Commonwealth and Rugby World Cup, but also for the 2022-2023 World Sevens Series. McGrath said he will focus on skills like ball handling, pass and catch and the breakdown. "Like I said earlier, the players have poor skills but in the next four to five weeks, we will improve on these skills," he observed. Skipper Nelson Oyoo said despite an underwhelming performance in the World Sevens Series, they still have a chance to medal at the Club Games. "Our focus is not to go and compete at the Commonwealth Games but to return with a medal. This training phase will, therefore, be crucial," said Oyoo.
