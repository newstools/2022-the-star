Harambee Starlets midfielder, Vivian Corazon Aquino, made her debut for Simba Queens barely three days after completing her dream move to the Tanzanian premiership champions. Aquino's maiden appearance, however, got off to a torrid start after they crashed 1-0 to Fountain Gate Princess in a charity match held at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium on Saturday. She becomes the second Kenyan player to turn out for Simba Queens after Bertha Omita who joined the team in 2020 and featured for only one season. Aquino, 23, joined Simba Queens on a two-year contract from Kenya Women's Premier League side Gaspo Women. She captained her former side to a third-place finish with 40 points in the just concluded season. In January 2020, Aquino made a giant leap to Portuguese side Atletico Ourense on a one-year deal before quitting mid-way into her contract. She has been a regular figure in the Harambee Starlets lineup since her call-up in 2016.
