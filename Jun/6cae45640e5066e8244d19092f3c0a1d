Taking chances is the only way Greensharks can beat the United States International University USIU-A Mashujaa in the Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League match on Sunday at the City Park Stadium, Sharks captain Victor Osiche has said. Three matches have been lined up this weekend in the men’s division with the women’s showpiece still in recess as the national team continues preparations for the Commonwealth Games slated for Birmingham, United Kingdom next month. Osiche said lack of cutting edge in the final third has cost the team points as Greensharks occupy eighth place in the 10-team league. Greensharks have seven points, four behind sixth-placed Mashujaa. “We start as underdogs because our rivals are currently enjoying a good run. We can only dream of winning should we take our chances. In our last encounter against Kenya Police, we played well, created numerous scoring opportunities but conversion was an issue,” said Osiche. Greensharks midfielder Eddy Odhiambo will be assessed ahead of the match after sitting out of the Police duel with a hamstring injury. A win will propel Greensharks to sixth spot. Defending champions and leaders Butali Warriors have a date with Wazalendo at the same venue. Butali have 20 points from eight encounters, having drawn two in an unbeaten run. South ‘B’-based Wazalendo will seek to do the unthinkable as they smart from a 4-1 defeat to Strathmore Gladiators two weeks ago. On-form Kenya Police, who are a point behind Butali, face a tricky Sailors team. Police have won their last five matches.
