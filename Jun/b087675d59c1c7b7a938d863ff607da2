The High Court of Kenya, Nairobi, has forwarded a case filed by Former Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko against the IEBC's decision to lock him out of the August 9, elections to Mombasa. IEBC had listed Sonko among aspirants who will not be cleared to vie  owing to their impeachment while in office. Sonko moved to court to quash the move terming it illegal and unconstitutional. Justice Ngaah Jairus said the matter would better be heard in Mombasa where Sonko is seeking an elective seat. "I therefore direct that the application be transferred to that court forthwith and be mentioned before the Presiding Judge for such orders or directions as the learned judge may deem fit to grant or give," Ngaah said. Sonko argued that it is illegal for the IEBC to block him yet he has already been cleared by the Registrar of Political Parties to contest. Chebukati's move was triggered by the EACC report to the Commission that listed two leaders who are not worth running for office, due to impeachment. Sonko was impeached in December 2020 following claims of abuse of office and gross violation of the Constitution .
