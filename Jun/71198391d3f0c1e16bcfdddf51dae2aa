Deputy President William Ruto is expected to lead the Kenya Kwanza Alliance campaign team to Vihiga county, to drum up support for their bottom up economic model. Ruto will be accompanied by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula among other dignitaries. The DP is set to start his rally in Kidundu stadium in Vihiga County. He will later proceed to Kakamega county in Mumias and Mayuba Stadium in Sirisia constituency. The rallies are set to end at around 4 pm at Muliro Gardens in Webuye constituency. Ruto’s tour in vihiga comes as UDA and ANC candidates battle out for their political supremacy at Mudavadi’s backyard. Initially Mudavadi had urged locals to vote in only ANC candidates and ignore UDA. “We have formed a coalition yes but his people can’t vote in ANC candidates be keen on that and don’t embarrass me,” he said. Ruto’s visit to the vote-rich region comes less than a week after he addressed a massive campaign rally at Bukhungu stadium in Kakamega, last Sunday. The rally at Bukhungu was preceded by a week-long campaign by Mudavadi and Wetang'ula in the region where they explained to supporters what their 30 per cent share of government promise to Luhyas by Kenya Kwanza means. DP has been in the Nyanza region where he had taken his campaigns to Kisii and parts of Nyamira. "I will ensure members of the Gusii community are given priority in my government," Ruto said.
