DP William Ruto has appointed Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki to be his chief agent ahead of the August 9 polls. The DP made the announcement on Saturday after receiving his nomination certificate from IEBC at Bomas of Kenya. Kindiki will be assisted by Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and UDA SG Veronica Maina in his new role, which will entail ensuring seamless communication between his team and the IEBC. "I have appointed responsible professionals to be our liaison between Kenya Kwanza and IEBC... They will work with you in making sure that the communication and the relationship between us as candidates and IEBC is useful and helpful," he said. Kindiki was among those fronted to be Ruto's running mate, but the DP picked Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua after a 17-hour meeting to unlock the running mate stalemate. Following the last month's decision, Kindiki announced that he was taking a break from politics and will not be available for any appointive position after the August 9 polls. Speaking at a press conference in a Nairobi hotel, the senator said he will be relaxing as he reflects on his future and prepare for a comeback. "I have taken a decision to take a break from elective politics. I will take the break to reorganise myself as I support my party to deliver the presidency," he said. He added that he will not be available for any appointment in Ruto's government even after the August polls. "I will not be seeking any appointive position whatsoever. However, I will be available to seek any position in future that may be available at the national level."
