The World Health Organization is pushing for a reduction of Covid vaccine doses ordered by Gavi and Covax from big manufacturers. Only 17.8 percent of the population in low-income countries have had at least one Covid vaccine dose but the global proportion is 66.3 percent. Covax has missed its target of vaccinating 70 percent of the population in every country in the world by this month. Around 31 percent of the Kenya adult population is fully vaccinated, ranging from over 50 percent in Nyeri to less than 10 percent in Marsabit. So around 70 percent of the population is not vaccinated at all, or only partially vaccinated. Now the positivity rate has shot back up to 11 percent. A Covid wave is again sweeping through Kenya. On Monday Health CS Mutahi Kagwe called on Kenyans to start wearing masks again, which we certainly should do, but more importantly we should all get fully vaccinated and get booster shots. Most developed economies are returning to normal because most citizens are vaccinated. Kenya must follow the same route. The Health ministry should launch an intensive publicity campaign for Kenyans to get fully vaccinated or to get their booster shots.
