Germany are working on their focus and how to attack more efficiently following four consecutive draws but will be ready for the World Cup in November, coach Hansi Flick said on Monday. The coach, who took over in September and is unbeaten in his first 12 matches in charge, saw his team win their first eight and draw the last four, including Nations League clashes with Italy, England and Hungary this month. Flick said he hoped his team would be rewarded for their hard work when they face Italy in Nations League A Group 3 on Tuesday in Moenchengladbach. “It is understood that I don’t see the four draws as something good,” Flick told a virtual news conference from their base in Herzogenaurach in Bavaria. “We want to win, the players and I. We want to develop our will to win matches when it matters. We are in a process of developing the team and we are very positive. “It is clear that there will be setbacks but then you go and do it better next time,” he said. Four-time world champions Germany, knocked out of the 2018 World Cup in the first round for their earliest exit in the competition in 80 years, want to hit top form at the year-ending World Cup in Qatar. “You can also say that we score in every game,” Flick said when asked about his attack’s efficiency. The Germans had just one effort on target in the entire 90 minutes of the 1-1 against Hungary. Flick’s team have scored four goals in their last four matches, with starting forward Timo Werner far from his best and none of these goals coming from a striker. “Wins are always important for teams and improve the confidence of the team,” Flick said. “It would good if we could be rewarded for our efforts. With a win there is also improved conviction that we have good quality.”
