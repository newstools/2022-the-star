The Central Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency has reported another milestone as one of its flagship projects nears completion. The agency says the much-awaited Chepareria Sewerage project stands at an overall progress rate of 95 percent and is expected to be complete by mid-July 2022. It is expected to unlock the business potential for the thousands of small-scale traders in the region. The multi-billion project is an endeavor funded jointly by Kenya and the African Development Bank under the Kenya Town Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Program. Chief Executive Officer Samuel Oruma said KTSWSSP is expected to catalyse commercial activities, drive economic growth, improve the quality of life and build resilience against climate variability and change. ‘The targeted towns benefiting from the project should be ready for the strategic opportunities poised by the completion of the projects,” he said. The Project is among the key enabler of the big four agenda and blueprint for the vision of 2030. Oruma disclosed that KTSWSSP is envisaged to provide more than 2.1 million people with reliable and sustainable water supply services and more than 1.3 million people with sewerage systems. “Water resources in the country are not evenly distributed. These projects are predicted to close this gap and achieve the right to clean and safe water to its citizens and ensure adequate quantities,” said the CEO. He cited the climate change phenomenon and its effects especially the emergence of severe cycles of droughts, and floods. Oruma said in addition to addressing the challenges posed by insufficient infrastructure base and weak institutional capacity, the proposed program will further support the reform initiatives such as regular performance monitoring.
