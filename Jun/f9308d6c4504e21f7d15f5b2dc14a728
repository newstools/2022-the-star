Five people have lost their lives following an accident that involved a train and a lorry in Ruiru, Kiambu county. The Monday evening tragedy also left 12 people injured. The lorry had stalled on the railway track in the Kihunguro area in Kiambu leading to the accident. The tragedy comes a day after 12 people perished in a road accident in a Kitui while on their way to the dowry negotiation ceremony. The 14-seater matatu is said to have carried beyond the required capacity with survivors blaming the driver for the accident. Survivors who spoke to the media accused the driver of being drunk and recklessly driving the car despite their warning. The matatu had 24 people on board. In another accident along Bomet -Narok road, 8 lives were lost on Friday after a trailer lost control and hit a 14-seater Ena Coach Matatu. 5 died on the spot while three succumbed to injuries while in hospital. Four others are recuperating at Narok County Hospital. A report released by NTSA last week showed that over 1900 deaths were recorded as a result of road accidents.
