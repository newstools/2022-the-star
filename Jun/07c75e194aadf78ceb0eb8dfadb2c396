ODM veteran politicians Fred Gumo on Monday accused Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago and allies of using abusive language and conducting a smear campaign against rivals. Gumo said it was very wrong of Mandago to use "unsavoury" language against other leaders supporting Azimio flagbearer Raila Odinga. "I was perturbed by some utterances made by UDA leaders who had come for a football tournament at the Kenyatta Stadium on Sunday," he said. He said it was unwise for the leaders led by Mandago to insult Raila, Defence Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa, former Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya and other leaders during their campaigns. Gumo said the insults could provoke violence, if not checked. Mandago must respect other leaders if he wants to be respected as a leader, he said. "Raila Odinga is the senior most politician in Kenya and he must be respected. He is not of your [young] age, behave yourself," Gumo said. The former Minister told the Kenya Kwanza brigade campaigning in Trans Nzoia and North Rift to uphold political tolerance and the rule of law. He further asked the National Cohesion and Integration Commission and investigative agencies to scale up surveillance and take action against those using hate speech. The Constitution, he said, should not be violated by leaders who want to be called "waheshimiwa." On Sunday, Mandago sparked outrage when he said Natembeya had used unsavoury language in referring to one community. Mandago, who was the chief guest during the Allan Chesang football tournament at the Kenyatta Stadium, used the occasion to endorse UDA candidates. Other leaders who addressed the crowd were Uasin Gishu governor candidate Jonathan Bii, Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi. (Edited by V. Graham)
