Strathmore University Blades coach Tony Ochieng has hailed his charges for bagging maximum points in their  Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) league matches. The fruitful weekend saw the students hit Thunder 76-69, the result coming after their 73-65 win over Umoja the previous day. Ochieng hailed Garang Ding and Denis Koja for their effort in the wins during the matches played at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. "It was a very tough game but the boys played their hearts out throughout the match to grind out maximum points,” said Ochieng. He added: “The key to that victory was our ability to contain Griffin Ligare and stop their scoring. The last five minutes was, especially, good for us because we made some crucial free shots from the line. We have made a good start and will keep on working hard.” In a balanced first half where each team gave as much as they got, the scores remained deadlocked 39-39. Blades hanged on 55-53. They had 22 points from Garang Ding and 16 from George Okoth. Ligare shot 33 for the losers. Thunder coach Sadat Gaya opined, “They did a good job on Griff that swung the momentum their way. We didn’t rebound well and gave them too much space." In the women top tie of the day, Eagle Wings nipped Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology 44-40. Benny Ramazani scored 18 points and Mshila Rose 12 for Eagle Wings, who were down 21-18 at the break. Sophia Rebecca sunk 17 points for the debuting students. "We had a good chance of winning this game but our finishing let us down. We need to be more lethal in the offence.” said JKUAT's coach Mary Chepkoi. In the Lower Division, Snipers opened fire against Strathmore University, gunning them down 62-54.
