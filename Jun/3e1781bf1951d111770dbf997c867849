Nothing slurps better than the moist feel of chocolate and vanilla in your mouth. Marble cake is basically a mixture of chocolate and vanilla cake. A marble cake is a cake with a streaked or mottled appearance achieved by very lightly blending light and dark butter. The ratio of wet to dry ingredients determine a cake's moisture level. If there's simply too much flour and not enough butter, a cake will taste dry. On the other hand, if there's too much milk and not enough flour, a cake will taste too wet. Ingredients Preparation Step 1: Preheat your oven to 175° C then grease or line a loaf pan completely with foil or parchment paper. Step 2: Using a medium bowl, place egg whites and egg yolks in separate bowls and beat them using an electric hand mixer on high. Beat egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Set aside. Step 3: To the egg yolks add oil, sugar & vanilla then beat on until thick as you slowly add milk, then slowly add flour mixture. Step 4: Using a spatula, gently fold egg whites into the flour mixture. Step 5: Place about 2/3 cup of the batter into the empty egg white bowl. Set the remaining mixture aside. To the 2/3 cup mixture fold in cocoa powder and 2 Tbsp. sugar. Step 6: Spoon alternating layers into the baking pan. Then for the swirl, run a dull knife through the batter 3 or 4 times, lengthwise. Step 7: Bake for 45 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes. Enjoy with a glass of milk or preferred beverage.
