Comedian Akuku Danger is detained at Nairobi West Hospital over Sh823,000 in accrued bills. His friend Sandra Dacha said Akuku was discharged on Monday but the hospital decided to detain him until he pays the remaining balance. She was appealing to Kenyans willing to help the former Churchill Show comedian and come through for him. "The hospital has refused to accept a collateral so that he can organise his finances from outside despite having their collateral from the January bill, which has a higher value than the total bill. Anyone willing to help in any way, please reach us," she wrote. Akuku was hospitalised two weeks ago. Sandra said Akuku's medical insurance card has cleared part of his bill. Akuku Danger was born with sickle-cell anaemia.
