Bonfire CEO Simon Kabu has told his fans not to listen to rumours surrounding his marriage. Simon Kabu was responding to allegations his marriage with Sarah Kabu had hit the rocks a few months ago. Speaking to Mungai Eve during Akothee's book launch on Saturday, Simon said, "Msiskie. The status quo remains, that don't listen. Don't listen we are there and moving on." Sarah Kabu had hinted she had 'left' the marriage after it became toxic. Kabu was coy to respond to rumours they are expecting a third child. "We are all very healthy, meaning things are still happening. The Bible says multiply and fill the world. I can respond to that question when Sarah and I are together," he said. Kabu said he is glad to be raising all his children, while wishing his 24-year-old daughter a happy birthday.
