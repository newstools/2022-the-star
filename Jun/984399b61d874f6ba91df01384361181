Lawyer Miguna Miguna on Friday said Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti is abusing his powers. He said in a tweet that governor aspirant Johnson Sakaja's tribulations are part of President Uhuru Kenyatta's ploy to impose Polycap Igathe on Nairobians. Miguna's tweet came moments after Sakaja was reportedly arrested. The police later clarified that the senator presented himself to the DCI to hand over a letter in which he had sought clarification on Kinoti's remarks linking him to a global crime syndicate. "The true position is that the senator presented himself at DCI headquarters following earlier newspaper reports that he was wanted by police over the university degree matter being canvassed by courts and electoral mechanisms," police spokesman Bruno Shosio said in a statement. Sakaja reportedly presented the letter to the head of investigations, John Gachomo’s office. His lawyer, Kamotho Adrian, however, said the Senator was arrested by four DCI officers from his office at Riverside where he had just concluded a campaign meeting with the Kamba community. Miguna claimed Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga has a fake degree and should also be investigated. "It won't succeed. Let them start with Kenyatta's and Raila's fake degrees," he said. "Let them investigate Odinga's fake degree with the same speed and thoroughness they have done to Sakaja's piece." Miguna had earlier said that the UDA party should replace Sakaja with lawyer Nelson Havi as its Nairobi governor candidate. Havi, who has already been cleared by the IEBC, is currently seeking Westlands parliamentary seat. Miguna said the commission should clear Havi, stating that Sakaja was cleared "erroneously".
