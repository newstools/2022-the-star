Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua have confirmed they will attend the 2022 presidential debate if called upon. The two spoke on Tuesday during a media conference in Karen. "I would love to attend," Karua said when asked if she was going to attend the debate. Raila on his part said he has no qualms presenting himself for debate. "I have participated before as you know. The other time I debated alone. So it will depend on the availability and preparations," he said. "But I am always ready," the ODM leader added. The debate is set for July. The Presidential Debate Secretariat (PDS) assured the participants and Kenyans at large of a fair and transparent process. "In these consultations, we will continue to ensure the debates are as inclusive and representative as possible," the head of the secretariat Clifford Machoka said on June 3. Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has threatened to not attend citing media bias. The four presidential candidates including Raila, Ruto, George Wajackoyah (Roots' Party) and David Mwaure (Agano Party) will be invited to explain to Kenyans their manifesto. The debate will allow live audiences, representing various sectors of society, to interrogate the candidates. Kenyans will also have a platform to send in their questions.
