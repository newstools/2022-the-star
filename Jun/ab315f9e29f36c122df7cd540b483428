Six matches are lined up in the penultimate Kenya Women's Premier League season with two more teams expected to join Kangemi Ladies in  Division One next season. Kangemi host 10th placed Bunyore Starlets at the Ligi Ndogo grounds with all the matches played on Sunday. Despite their early-season imperious form, Bunyore are winless in the last eight matches with a toothless attack blamed for the team woes. Zachariah Amakhanga's charges have only mastered 16 points to date. Failure to beat Kangemi will likely hand the Vihiga County side the direct ticket to the second tier considering they play red hot and merciless Vihiga Queens next weekend. Kayole will be hoping to recover from their 1-0 disappointing loss to Nakuru last weekend with Trans-Nzoia Falcons awaiting at the ASK Showground, Kitale. Kayole are second from the bottom also with 16 with the race tipped to go down to the wire. Kisumu All Starlets face an arduous task against Thika Queens. With 17 points, they are not yet safe unless both Kayole and Bunyore lose their matches. Champions Vihiga host Wadadia at Mumias Sports Complex. Wadadia with 22 points are safe even if they fail to win their remaining two matches because both Bunyore Starlets and Kayole have a superior negative goal difference. Super Cup champions Ulinzi Starlets face an awkward encounter against Gaspo Women. The soldiers are second with 41 points and need only a point to seal their position. Gaspo, who are third, have blown hot and cold and were out of title contention after the first leg.  Fifth-placed  Zetech Sparks face-off with Nakuru. Vihiga's Topista Situma tops the goal-scoring charts with 15 goals—three more than both Fasila Adhiambo of Kangemi and Sparks' Puren Alekwe (both with 12). Seven players have scored 10 goals namely: Monica Etot (Kisumu), Mercy Airo, Sheril Angachi and Siliya Rasoa (Ulinzi), Carol Khaemba (Nakuru), Stella Anyango (Thika) and Nakuru's Nabangala Nyongesa.
