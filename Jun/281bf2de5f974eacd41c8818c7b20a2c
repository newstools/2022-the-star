ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is a major beneficiary of Raila Odinga’s politics, former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende has said. He said Mudavadi was appointed as the minister for Local Government and Deputy Prime Minister during the Grand Coalition government of Raila and President Mwai Kibaki. Marende said during Kibaki's regime, he (Marende) was appointed the Speaker of the National Assembly and six other people in Western were appointed ministers. “Those claims made by Kenya Kwanza people from Western that Raila has been using the Luhya Nation for his selfish gains are misinformed,” he told the Star on the phone. “I worked with Raila between 2007-2013 when he was the Prime Minister. He also appointed six ministers from Western and promoted Mudavadi." Marende was reacting to accusations made by Kenya Kwanza alliance leaders from Western who claim Raila uses and dumps Luhya leaders. The former Speaker said Raila has been giving the Mulembe Nation a fair deal compared to what Deputy President William Ruto is giving to Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. “DP Ruto is demanding 70 per cent of votes for the two to get a 30 per cent stake in government,” Marende said. “Will they be able to deliver that? It is mission impossible." Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said Wetang'ula and Mudavadi are desperate to see how they will deliver the 70 per cent demanded by Ruto. He said under Azimio la Umoja they have no conditions to meet but are assured of government positions. He said when Mudavadi lost to Moses Akaranga in 2002 as Sabatia MP, it was Raila who brought him back from the political cold and helped him reclaim his Sabatia seat. Osotsi said when Wetang'ula was removed as the Senate leader of Minority, Raila tried to save him from the wrath of the fellow senators. Edited by A.N
