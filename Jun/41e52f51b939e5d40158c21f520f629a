Directorate of Criminal Investigations detectives are looking for a woman suspected of running a child trafficking ring in the country. According to DCI boss George Kinoti, Elizabeth Emboyoga Litonde is suspected to be the mastermind behind disappearance of school going children who are then smuggled outside the country as slaves. “She is believed to have escaped to western Kenya moments before our sleuths from the serious crimes unit pounced on her,” Kinoti said. He called on anyone with information that might lead to her arrest to reach to DCI. “Any info regarding her whereabouts will greatly assist us safeguarding the lives of our children. #FichuakwaDCI 0800 722 203.”
