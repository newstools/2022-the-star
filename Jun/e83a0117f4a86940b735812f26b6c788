Email provider Yahoo Mail is experiencing downtime again barely less than a week after users reported downtime. This has left users unable to sign in and access their emails. The problem reported by most of its users started on Tuesday morning. Most opted to use the alternative, Gmail, to send emails. Down Detector, an independent outage monitor recorded an increase in Yahoo Mail down reports from 7 pm on Monday with most Kenyans reporting the problem from Tuesday at 7 am. Although lately, users have complained most about emails not downloading the content, attachments, and it being very slow. This could certainly be due to server issues in different regions. With over 200 million users worldwide, outages will be felt by many even when located only in certain countries.
