Police in Kisii are pursuing suspects over a plot to cause violence. At least two machetes were found near the county IEBC  offices Monday morning, sparking a search by security agencies. County police boss Francis Kooli said the pangas were found as more governor race candidates presented their papers. Those cleared include Ezekiel Machogu (UDA) and Chris Obure (Jubilee Party). Police said a reflector jacket emblazoned "Hon Ezekiel Machogu" was found wrapped round the machetes. Machogu has since denied links with the incident, saying it is likely a set up this being a political season. He asked security agencies to undertake investigations with a view to taking action on the perpetrators. "I heard claims this morning that some people were arrested  with machetes. I want to tell you that I am a peace loving citizen and would not be party to such schemes," Machogu said. He said he has been a senior government officer and would not participate in any acts of hooliganism. "The whole story about this sounds cooked up to divert attention from the real culprits, who are likely to be our opponents." The incident was condemned by Senate hopeful Joash Maangi and Machogu's running mate Ogamba Migosi. Kooli  said they would be summoning Machogu over the incident. "We have done this as a precautionary measure as investigations begin," he told journalists at his office. They machetes were confiscated near Kisii Sports Club metres away from IEBC offices and were sharpened on both ends. It was not immediately ascertained if they were dumped by a team of Kazi kwa Vijana who were already at the site. Some daggers were recovered by police last week as security agencies upped surveillance, Kooli said.  They  were being transported by a boda boda rider. Kooli said they are pursuing more suspects being used to fan chaos. The weapons were seized following intelligence reports that had been monitored over a month, he added.   -Edited by SKanyara
