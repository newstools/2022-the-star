Croatia midfielder Luka Modric has signed a one-year contract extension with Real Madrid and will stay at the European champions at least until June 2023, the club announced on Wednesday. The announcement was made not long after the 36-year-old won his fifth Champions League title in a decade with the LaLiga champions. He also won the Ballon d’Or in 2018. It is the second year in a row that Modric has signed a one-year extension with Real as his current contract was set to expire at the end of June. Modric has played 436 games in all competitions for Real, scoring 31 goals and providing 73 assists. He is the 20th player with the most appearances in the club’s history, two behind Cristiano Ronaldo. Along with five Champions League titles, Modric has also won three LaLiga titles, one Copa del Rey, four Spanish Super Cups, three European Super Cups and four Club World Cups at Madrid. Meanwhile, Liverpool forward Takumi Minamino is attracting interest from a number of clubs, with the Reds prepared to sell the Japan international for a fee in the region of £17m. Leeds, Wolves, Fulham, Southampton and Monaco are understood to be admirers. Minamino made the move to Liverpool from Red Bull Salzburg in 2019. The 27-year-old joined Southampton on loan in February 2021 and made 10 appearances before returning to Anfield for the 2021-22 campaign. As Liverpool’s top scorer in domestic cup competitions last season, Minamino played a crucial part in helping Jurgen Klopp’s side win the FA Cup and League Cup. However, he made just 11 appearances in the Premier League as Liverpool finished one point behind Manchester City. Since joining the club, he has scored 14 times in 55 appearances.
