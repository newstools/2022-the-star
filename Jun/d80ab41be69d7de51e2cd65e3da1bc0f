Mwingi West MP, Charles Nguna has urged heads of state to convene a meeting and seek a lasting solution for the high cost of living occasioned by hiked fuel prices. Speaking at Muukuni primary school shortly after launching an administration block, Nguna said it is so unfair what Kenyans are going through stating the high cost of living has risen far too high. "We are not blaming our President but this is a global crisis that needs to be addressed in order to reach global solutions," Nguna said. He also said the war between Ukraine and Russia that has now lasted for four months has highly contributed to inflation. Nguna asked global leaders to intervene and stop the conflict that has led to the loss of hundreds of lives as well as the mass destruction of properties. "Different countries in the world have taken to streets to protest the high cost of living and it is time leaders come together to come up with a lasting solution in order to cushion citizens who are struggling to survive," he said. He also drummed up support for Azimio one Kenya alliance asking Kenyans to embrace the leadership under Raila Odinga for a better country evidenced by their manifesto. Nguna also lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for allocating sh.4.2 billion in order to complete the Kibwezi-Kitui road that had stalled at the Kwa Siku area in Mwingi west constituency. Upon completion, the road is set to join Thika-Garissa road at Mbondoni market.
