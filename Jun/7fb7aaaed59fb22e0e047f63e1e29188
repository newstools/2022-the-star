Deputy President William Ruto is yet again at the centre of controversy after he quoted a Bible verse that is non-existent. In an interview with NTV on Sunday, the DP quoted a Bible verse to explain how the disciples of Jesus asked Him what He has for them given that they had left what they were doing to earn a living to follow Him. "In Mathew 17: 29, when the disciples of Jesus Christ were following Him, they asked Him; 'we have left our families, we have le left our businesses. We used to be fishermen, we have come to follow you, what is in it for us?" Ruto stated. The above Bible verse the DP quoted is non-existent. The book of Mathew 17 ends in verse 27. The Bible message the DP quoted was from Mathew 19: 27 which says: "Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you. What then will be there be for Us". The mishap has degenerated into a war of words on social media with his opponents hitting out at him. The DP, who has fashioned himself as a God-fearing man, was disparaged by a section of Kenyans including leaders allied to the Azimio coalition. While reacting to the Video of the DP quoting the verse, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu said: "Mathew Chapter 17 ends at verse 27. Praise the Lord". Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu on her part posed: "Mathew 17:29? Which verse is that boss? It doesn't exist. Or we are using a different Bible?" Other reactions from Kenyans:
