Amber Ray and her Sierra Leonian ex-boyfriend IB Kabba have re-ignited their beef after their bitter fallout. Kabba said he felt sorry for any man who landed on her. "Tell her to stop living a fake life on social media and stop having intimacy in the bushes. She really needs to grow up," he wrote. This isn't the first time Kabba has attacked Amber. In May, Kabba went on a rant, complaining that Amber had accused him of trying to control her life while it was she who used to take his phone and block people. He also said that he regretted dating Amber, considering he didn't know her dramatic relationship history at the time. "I don’t think everyone is surprised that Amber Ray has moved on. If I knew the kind of person she was from the start, I would never have been involved with her," he said. "I don’t regret what we had, but it seems that she has moved on many times before." Amber Ray responded with a laughing emoji. "I know I’m not good enough but some people will never forget me in their life," she said.
