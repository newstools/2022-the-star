Murang'a Senator Irungu Kang'ata has been denied clearance by the IEBC to vie for Murang'a governor seat. This is after the electoral body established that his running mate Winnie Mwangi failed to resign within the legal timelines. The Elections Act requires state officers seeking elective seats to resign six months to an election. In the context of the August 9 General Election, state officers were required to resign by February 9, 2022. Mwangi had been working as a lecturer at the University of Nairobi for over 25 years before she was picked to be Kang'ata's running mate. EACC forwarded a letter to IEBC indicating that Mwangi did not resign by February 9 as was required by the law. But Kang'ata read malice into the decision and blamed his competitors who he said have ganged up against him in am attempt to block his clearance to vie for the governor seat. "We have evidence that she resigned on time and we will be coming back tomorrow to prove it," he said. Kang'ata is contesting for the seat against five other candidates through UDA party ticket.
