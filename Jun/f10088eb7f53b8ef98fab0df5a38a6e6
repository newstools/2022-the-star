A famous City actress has been charged with obtaining Sh152,550 credit by false pretenses after dining and drinking expensive liquor at a city restaurant. Dorah Ojenge was charged at Kibera Law Courts on Friday where she pleaded not guilty to the charges. According to the court, she was booked in at the hotel on May 26 and May 27. She then ordered two chicken breasts valued at Sh3,000, one cocktail drink valued at Sh2,000, two bottles of 300ml coke valued at Sh500. She also ordered a one litre bottle of mineral water valued at Sh400 and three bottles of Red Bull energy drink valued at Sh1,650.

When asked to pay, Ojenge said her bank had some problems and failed to pay. She however denied the charges before Kibera senior principal magistrate Monica Maroro. Her lawyer Mwihaki Nganga told the court that the actress was not a flight risk and should be released on bail. "Your honor, my client is not a flight risk and she will not abscond from courts, " Nganga said. The magistrate agreed and released her on Sh100,000 bond with an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000.
