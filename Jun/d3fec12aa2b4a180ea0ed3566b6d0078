The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) on Tuesday announced a hike in fuel prices by Sh9 per litre. The price change will be effective from June 15 to July 14, 2022. "The prices are inclusive of the eight per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2018, the Taxes Law 2020 and the revised rates for excise duty adjusted for inflation as per Legal Notice No 194/2020,"  EPRA said The Authority said the government will use the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) to cushion customers from the high prices. Super petrol will cost Sh159.12 per litre as opposed to Sh184.68 which would have been the pay had PDL not covered the Sh25.56 difference. The levy has covered Sh48.19 in the prices of diesel. This means motorists will pay Sh150 per litre and not Sh188.9. For kerosene, the government has cushioned by Sh42.43. The prices will be Sh127.94 per litre as opposed to the originally calculated Sh170.37. The landed cost of imported super petrol increased by 5.96 per cent from US$826.77 (Sh96,897.44) per cubic meter in April to US$876.05 (Sh102,673.06) in May. Diesel prices increased by 10.90 per cent from US$899.36 (Sh105,404.99) per cubic meter in April to US$997.35 (Sh116,871.84) in May. The cost of Kerosene has however decreased by 0.34 per cent from US$908.66 (Sh106,494.95) per cubic meter in April to US$905.60 (Sh106,136.32)  in May.
