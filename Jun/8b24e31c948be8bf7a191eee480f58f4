Civil society organisations in Homa Bay are engaging governor candidates in a dialogue to ensure issues affecting residents are captured in their manifestos. Under the umbrella of the Homa Bay County Civil Society Organisations Network, they have done public participation to identify key issues affecting residents. The issues include health, water, agriculture and the youth. The union chairman Mathews Owili, vice-chairman Japeth Ojijo and the Kenneth Ouma of the National Council for Churches of Kenya have already engaged UDA candidate Mark Rabudi. They presented the issues to Rabudi in Homa Bay town through a meeting held virtually. Representatives of more than ten civil society organisations met Rabudi in a Homa Bay town hotel. “We gathered information on key issues affecting residents. We have started with Rabudi before engaging the other two candidates,” Owili said. The remaining candidates are ODM’s Gladys Wanga and Evans Kidero who is vying as independent candidate. Speaking on Friday during the dialogue, Ojijo said they want to ensure the issues are incorporated in the County Integrated Development Plan of 2022-27 and the annual development plans. This will ensure that the issues are implemented regardless of whoever wins. “We don’t know who is going to win the gubernatorial seat but we are engaging all the candidates so that whoever wins implements the recommendations we have stipulated,” Ojijo said. He argued that the process also involves analysing the development agenda of the candidates and how they are going to be implemented. “All we want is leadership which is people-centred and this can only be achieved through public participation," Ojijo said. They urged residents to focus on a candidate’s manifesto rather than handouts. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
