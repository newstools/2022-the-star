Bungoma county commissioner Samuel Kimiti has warned those politicising the Kazi Mtaani programme. Kimiti urged those seeking elective positions to stick to selling their agenda to the electorate instead of interfering with government projects. The administrator was on Wednesday addressing youths who had come to his office to inquire about the programme. He said Kazi Mtaani is still on and dismissed claims that it has been canceled. He said the programme had just been paused to clean the data to identify the next group of youths who will be involved. “The programme is still on, so avoid listening to people who are peddling lies about it and all of those who received the messages will be notified on when to report to work,” Kimiti said. Kimiti asked those whose names are in the Kazi Mtaani system and require any classification to visit the assistant chief offices for any classification. He warned them against forwarding Kazi Mtaani messages to others who have not received job messages and wait for communication from the Ministry of Housing. “Some of you are forwarding messages that were sent to from the ministry, please if you applied wait for your time and you will be considered,” Kimiti said. He said slots for those who transferred from the areas they were living or joined middle-level colleges and universities will be filled by others. Kimiti added that he will work closely with the government to ensure the programme runs smoothly in Bungoma. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
