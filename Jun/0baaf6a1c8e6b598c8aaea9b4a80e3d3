Nandi Bears’ golfer Vincent Rugut registered his maiden win since venturing into the game four years ago during the Captain’s Prize (Nathan Tororei) yesterday on the 9-hole course. Playing handicap 32, Rugut fired 38 Stableford points to emerge winner on one of the most challenging golf courses. Rugut, who ventured into the sport in 2018, described the Eldoret Golf Club course as tough and challenging. “Things went smoothly though the captain exerted some challenges in holes 2 and 7, where we were forced to use an iron 3 and a driver, respectively,” he said. “There were further challenges on hole 10 but I am happy I prevailed,” he added. He admitted that the challenges introduced by the captain made the play more interesting and entertaining. “I almost blanked on hole 2 because I didn’t know that I was to use Iron 3. I am happy though that I came home with my first win at the club after managing the first nine prizes. Apart from golf, I also play tennis, badminton, and squash,” he said. The event was sponsored by County Pension Fund and Mediheal Hospital among others and attracted 90 golfers as they celebrated the final reign of Tororei as the captain. Jackson Kiprop will serve as captain for the next one year. Another Nandi player Isaac Kuto was second with 37 points and Eldoret’s Anthony Yano completed the podium with 36 points. Home lady captain Diana Chemweno and Kenneth Serem were the longest drive winners in women's and men's categories while Pyare Aggarwal was the nearest to pin winner.
