Google has revealed new updates for Android users as a part of its quarterly Feature drop this June. The new features will include new Gboard features, Google Play Points as an option to pay during checkout, improvements to background noise reduction in Sound Amplifier, and a new image mode to Lookout. The Gboard feature will allow users to turn text into a custom sticker. All you have to do is start typing, then choose an emoji recommendation for those words, and then you will see a new option to customize. The company is also rolling out more than 1,600 new Emoji Kitchen combinations to help users express themselves by making new hybrid emojis. Designed for and with people with hearing loss, Sound Amplifier will use your phone to amplify and filter important sounds around you. Designed with and for people with low vision or blindness, Lookout uses your Android device’s camera to provide information about the world around you with a variety of modes. There are also updates to the app’s Text mode, Documents mode, Food label mode, and Explore mode to make Lookout more accurate. The app also now works offline without the need for a Wi-Fi or data service connection. Google Play Points is a rewards program that lets you earn points and rewards for the ways you already use Google Play. You can soon use your Play Points for in-app items at checkout, without leaving your favorite apps and games. Cover the entire item with Play Points or split between Play Points and another form of payment. All of these new features will roll out over the coming days and weeks.
