Fast-rising Amos Serem is plotting to revive Kenya's dwindling fortunes in the 3,000m steeplechase by winning gold at the Commonwealth Games. He said despite doubts being cast on the country's chances in the event, Serem said they have mooted a plan to win the title. “The 3000m steeplechase gold has always belonged to Kenya and for sure, we want to keep it at that. "I know there is a lot of pressure, especially on me from the coaches and fans but we will deliver. "The strategy we are going to use is teamwork and effortlessly working on our speed, especially in the last lap where the likes of Girma Lamech and Bakkali have been giving us a hard time," he said. Serem clocked 8:17.03 to win the race during the just-concluded Commonwealth and World Championship National Trials at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The 2016 African bronze medallist Abraham Kibiwott finished second in 8:17.79 while world champion Conseslus Kipruto was third in 8:18.21. When he clinched the World Under-20 title last year, he stated that the next step would be to make it to the World Championship. His dream seems to have come to pass as he will make the four-man team alongside Conseslus Kipruto, Abraham Kibiwott and Amos Kirui.
