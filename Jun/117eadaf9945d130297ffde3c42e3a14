Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga will on Thursday take his campaign to Isiolo County. This will follow his extensive tour of the larger Ukambani region that began with Machakos on Sunday and ended with Kitui on Wednesday. The former Prime minister will take his time to sell the Azimio la Umoja agenda for the country if elected president in the August 9 General election. Raila's running mate Martha Karua will also take the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance campaigns to Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties, as they intensify their vote hunt in the Eastern region. Karua will hold rallies in Kathwana stadium and the Meru showground. Deputy President William Ruto will, however, continue with his tour of the Gusii region, with scheduled visits to Nyakoe in Kitutu Chache South, Isecha in Kitutu Chache North and Nyaguta in Nyaribari Masaba constituency. On Wednesday, Ruto campaigned in Kisii where he held a series of meetings across three Sub counties, including; Nyamache in Bobasi Constituency, Kenyenya in Bomachoge Borabu Constituency and Itierio in Bonchari Constituency.
