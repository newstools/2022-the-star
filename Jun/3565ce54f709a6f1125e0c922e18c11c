The county of Garissa has made tremendous strides to reduce maternal and perinatal deaths, Health executive Roble Nunow said. Nunow spoke during the maternal and newborn health knowledge management event in Garissa town on Monday. He said training of the technical staff by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and follow-ups has proven to be the best intervention mechanism. "The programme which began in 2019, has seen Garissa health management team partner with Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine to offer training to health workers on emergency obstetrics and newborn care,"Nunow said. The Health CEC said more training on advanced obstetric surgical, anesthesia care and maternal perinatal death surveillance is ongoing. He expressed government commitment to strengthen and provide oversight, technical support and resource mobilisation. The maternal mortality rate in Garissa stood at 5,000 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2008. In 2013, the rate reduced to 3,900 death per 100,000 births and improved further in 2018 to 500 per 100,000 births. “Our target is to have fewer than 50 deaths per 100,000 live births. This is achievable if we remain committed and focussed,” he said. He said the construction and subsequent equipping of facilities has been a game changer. More than 3,000 women die in Kenya annually because of complications related to pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium period. According to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study, Kenya has reported a decline in infant mortality from 62 deaths per 1,000 live births to 22 between 1990-19. For every woman who dies in childbirth in Kenya, it is estimated that another 20 to 30 suffer serious injury or disability due to complications during pregnancy or delivery. By 2030, the target is to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Global neonatal mortality to 12 per 1,000 births and achieve access to quality essential healthcare services for all through Universal Health Coverage. Kenya has made strides in improving maternal and child health outcomes, but a lot still needs to be done to address the supply and demand barriers in the delivery of maternal and newborn health services. The devolution governance structure has provided an opportunity to address the systemic inequities and inefficiencies in the health system. Counties have given priority to expanding primary health care services, hence increasing access to preventive and promotive services. Free maternity services through the National Hospital Insurance Fund also provide an avenue for reducing the financial burden on pregnant women and their families. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
