Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja on Monday got cleared by the IEBC to seek a second term. Samboja, who was accompanied by his wife Stella and his running mate Priscilla Mwangeka, said the time had come to solidify his support across the county. He said his clearance had opened a new chapter to get a new term as a governor. "It is a done deal, the goose is cooked for my opponents. Let us meet at the ballot," Samboja said while receiving his clearance certificate at the Taita Taveta University. He expressed confidence in winning the hotly contested race. Samboja asked his competitors to preach peace and carry out peaceful campaigns. "The most important thing now is peace. I urge my fellow candidates to ensure they preach peace," the county boss said, further promising to accept the outcome of the August 9 polls. The Jubilee candidate pledged to complete the development project he started during his first term once elected in office. He said his administration is committed to completing all ongoing development projects and initiating new projects that will boost the county’s economy. "Our agenda will be very simple, to complete projects that we started during our first five years," he said. Some 13 candidates are seeking votes from the 155,716 registered voters in the county. They are governor Samboja, former governor John Mruttu, Mwatate legislator Andrew Mwadime, and former senator Dan Mwazo. Others are Stephen Mwakesi, media personality Patience Nyange, George Mwandembo, Prof Agnes Mwang'ombe, Faustin Mghendi, Godino Mwasaru, Onsemus Mwinzi, Tom Mwakwida, and Francis Mwaita. As of Monday, IEBC had cleared 11 out of the 13 candidates. Those yet to be cleared are Mruttu and Nyange. Mruttu is scheduled to appear before the commission on Monday evening while Nyange is scheduled for Tuesday. Nyange was early set to appear before the commission on Sunday but she requested to be pushed until Tuesday in order to swap her running mate.    -Edited by SKanyara
