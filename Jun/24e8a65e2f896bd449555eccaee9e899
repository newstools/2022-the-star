The high court has temporarily barred Judicial Service Commission (JSC) from recruiting new judges to the court of appeal and high court. JSC had shortlisted candidates for interviews this month to fill positions of judges of the court of appeal and high court. Justice Antony Mrima has this morning issued conservatory orders suspending any further action by JSC, including invitation, consideration, evaluation, deliberation or interview of application for appointment of judges to the court of appeal and high court. Judge Mrima has said that whereas there is a need to recruit more judges to the superior courts, the recruitment process must itself comply and be within the constitution otherwise it will be null and void. In the case, Katiba Institute had sued CJ Martha Koome and JSC seeking to stop the recruitment of new judges until the 6 judges are appointed into office.
