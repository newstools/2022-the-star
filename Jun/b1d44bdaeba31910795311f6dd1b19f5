Deputy President William Ruto has arrived in Kwale for an economic forum event. It is his second day to tour the region after launching a series of political rallies at the coast on Friday. He commenced his rallies in Taita-Taveta, Kwale and Mombasa. The DP is meeting with Kwale locals at the county government headquarters in Tsimba/Golini ward in Matuga sub-county. He is hosted by Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya and his deputy Fatuma Achani. Ruto is accompanied by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula, Machakos governor Alfred Mutua and Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki among others. They are expected to discuss matters of the economy and future goals of the county. According to county UDA party official Mshenga Ruga, issues of land injustices and resettlement of squatters, minerals and improvement of the blue economy are expected to dominate today's discussions. Ruga said it won't be a political gathering but a special economy session between DP and locals. "This is not a political campaign meeting, what will be discussed here are key issues pressing our economy," he said. He said the Ruto is making a blueprint of his economic model and how he can achieve his agenda if elected president on August 9. On Friday Ruto held the rallies at Kajire, Wundanyi in Taita-Taveta, Samburu (Kwale) and Changamwe (Mombasa). In his rallies, Ruto faulted the handshake for the high cost of living and malfunctioning of the Big Four agenda. He said his bottom-up economic model was the way forward and salvation to the our bleeding economy. Ruto promised to create job opportunities and improve food security through agriculture. On Saturday, the DP will in the afternoon lead a major rally at Tononoka grounds in Mombasa.
