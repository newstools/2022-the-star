2017 top KCPE student Goldalyn Kakuya has continued with her sterling academic performance. She is the first girl with albinism to top the KCPE exams since its inception. Her sterling performance won the admiration of many including President Uhuru Kenyatta and first lady Margaret Kenyatta. The first lady sponsored her education at the Brook House School Karen where she undertook the Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE). She was transferred to the prestigious school a year after joining Kenya High School in 2018. On Friday, Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura took to Facebook to share her impressive academic results. "Goldalyn Kakuya has finally graduated from Form Six at Brook-house Karen after 5 good years.  She is an A* (star) student. She intends to study medicine at an International University. Today (Friday) I joined her family and friends in celebrating this victory," Mwaura said. Kakuya studied 10 subjects. She reportedly recorded 8 A*s (Star) and two As in the IGCSE exams. Mwaura is among the well-wishers who supported Kakuya to pursue her education. In 2017, he rewarded her Sh100,000 cheque for making the albino community proud. In 2017, Kakuya scored 455 in KCPE exams. She was a pupil of St Ann Junior School Lubao in Kakamega.
