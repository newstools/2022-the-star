Police have recovered 39 cattle that had been reported to have strayed in their grazing fields in Matalana in Marsabit. National Police Service Service (NPS) said the cattle recovered yesterday were due to collaboration between the multi-agency security team and elders from Shurr location. NPS called on residents to continue sharing useful information through community policing and nyumba kumi mechanisms. “We commend all the communities for their immense support and urge them to embrace peaceful initiatives in solving conflicts and to share information with the police,” NPS said. On Monday, the multi-agency team recovered eight cattle, which had been reported missing by residents of Jaldesa. "The security team is engaging all communities to sensitize on the importance of branding their livestock for ease of identification whenever they are stolen and stray away from the grazing fields,” NPS said. This comes in the wake of an ongoing operation to mop-up illegal guns in Marsabit county due to rising insecurity cases. Officials said the operation will continue until at least 5,000 illegal firearms are retrieved. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said although the multi-agency team deployed last month had restored peace in the vast county, the mopping of illegal weapons must be concluded as a long-term security strategy. He said more than 200 guns, 3,000 ammunitions, a grenade and assorted bayonets have been recovered under Operation Rejesha Amani Marsabit. Elsewhere, a multy-agency security team has also recovered an AK-47 rifle and an empty magazine from a resident of Chemurtoi in Baringo. According to police, the resident voluntarily surrendered the gun to the Chief of Naundo who handed it to .the Officer Commanding Tangulbei Police Station for safe custody on June 27. The security operation in Baringo is aimed at restoring peace in the area.
