Kenya Prisons men's volleyball coach David Lung'aho reiterated that his charges have picked up at the right time and deserve a playoff slot if their sixth leg results are anything to go by. The Warders began the penultimate leg lying sixth on the table and as outsiders to finish in the top four. Resounding wins against Kenya Ports Authority KPA, Equity Bank and Western Prisons, however, have placed Prisons back in contention. Prisons have climbed to third on the standings with 28 points from 11 matches and take on perennial rivals the General Service Unit, Vihiga, Central Prisons and Administration Police in the last leg this weekend slated for Nyayo gymnasium. "My players have hit top form at the best time when we needed excellent performance. Nobody gave us a chance, especially after the fifth leg but we are on course to achieving our targets," the former long-serving national women's coach explained. "We had to find a winning formula again and the playoffs destiny is firmly in our hands." Meanwhile, KPA and GSU's unbeaten records were finally broken. The Coastal side remain top of the log with 34 points. Despite losing 3-0 to KPA last Friday, GSU, who are the defending champions, are second with 28 points—having played two games less than KPA. Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) close the top four places while Kenya Forest Service, Trail Blazers and Equity follow in that order and have a chance to break into the top four. Central Prisons are last in the 16-team league with zero points from nine matches. Vihiga who are second last, have managed just three points from a walkover match against Central Prisons.
