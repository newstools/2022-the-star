TV host Joyce Maina says a while ago, she could never go out without makeup. Speaking about her insecurities with Kwambox TV, Joyce said she was also insecure about her small chest and being skinny. "With time, I started gaining weight and I was insecure about that as well," she said. "I have overcome those insecurities now, but we are human, so there are new insecurities every day." Joyce said fighting back against bullies helped her fight depression. "You could overpower me in a fight but I had a very sleek mouth. That is why I was never bullied." Radio personality Sheila Kwamboka, also known as Kambox, said she had insecurities about her big feet. "My dad used to joke that I should go and get married to a cobbler."
