Nothing is more hectic than using a lot of utensils when preparing a dish. It can be quite a buzz kill, especially if you love cooking but hate doing the dishes. You can mix rice with steamed carrots, peas, green beans, mushrooms and corn. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Season your diced chicken with paprika then toss to coat and set aside on a plate. Step 2 Heat butter in a large pan over medium-high heat and cook the onion for 2-3 minutes, until translucent. Step 3 Add your diced chicken to the pan along with the pepper, seasoning of choice and salt. Cook your chicken for 5 minutes until it is golden on all sides, stirring regularly. Step 4 Add in your minced garlic, and cook for one minute then add your vegetables. Stir in chicken stock and rice and bring to a boil over low heat. Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until rice is cooked and completely tender. Step 5 Stir in heavy cream and parmesan.  This step is optional. Then adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to your desired taste. Sprinkled fresh chopped parsley and enjoy with your favourite cold drink.
