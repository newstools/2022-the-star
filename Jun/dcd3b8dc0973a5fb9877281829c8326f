Nairobi independent governor candidate Agnes Kagure is intensifying her campaigns, pledging to boost the city's health sector. Kagure, the only woman in the governor race, on Monday met with Community Health Workers and Volunteers' leaders. If elected, she promised to operationalise the monthly salaries for the workers and volunteers. “Courtesy of our ongoing partnership, we'll roll out personal protective equipment across the 17 subcounties to our selfless CHW and CHVs who do so much but get so little,” Kagure said. “Further, as we work to get to office and operationalise the monthly salaries for this gallant team, I have committed to financially support the CHWs/CHVs self-help groups, even as we work towards formalising a Sacco for them,”she added. To win over the youth, Kagure picked Abel Oyieyo as her running mate. Kagure described Oyieyo as a young leader who brings "youthful zeal and insight" to the City Hall race. “I am a firm believer in the youth's potential to lead. This is why I settled on the youthful Abel Onchari Oyieyo as my running mate,” she said. In January, Kagure launched her bid for Nairobi governor seat, announcing that her manifesto would seek to revamp water supply, sanitation, ensuring healthcare for all and  reorganising public transport to ease movement. With less than 55 days left to the elections, Kagure is among  four candidates seeking to succeed Governor Ann Kananu. Others in the race are Azimio la Umoja candidate Polycarp Igathe, Johnson Sakaja of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance and Kenneth Nyamwamu of the United Progressive Alliance Party. Nyamwamu has urged Nairobi residents to usher in a new leadership, whose image is not tainted.
