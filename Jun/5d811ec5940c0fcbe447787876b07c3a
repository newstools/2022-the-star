President Uhuru Kenyatta has called on school principals to allow learners who profess the Akurinu faith to wear turbans. The president said the Constitution guarantees all Kenyans freedom worship wherever they are. “Every religion has its doctrines, our Muslim brothers and sisters go wherever they want in their hijabs and nobody questions them. The Sikh wear their turbans in schools, churches and businessess and no one questions them. “I want to reiterate, more so to our school principals who are still discriminating the Akurinu because of their turbans, that is not right. There is no law that bars anyone from identifying themselves by their religion,” Uhuru said. The president spoke on Sunday during the annual General Conference of the Akurinu church held at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani in Nairobi county. The conference was attended by thousands of Akurinu faithful as the church marked 100 years of existence in Kenya since its inception. Debate on the wearing of religious attire in learning institutions in Kenya has generated controversy for years. In January 2019, the Supreme Court overturned a Court of Appeal ruling that allowed Muslim students to wear hijabs in public and church-run schools. In their ruling, the judges said every school should has the right to determine its own rules. The court said students are not free to wear hijab in non-Muslim schools said schools as schools are free to decide their dress codes.
