President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday shocked the nation after he breached tradition and began addressing the Madaraka Day celebrations before his deputy William Ruto spoke. Ordinarily, it has been Kenya's culture that Deputy President would speak first and in turn, welcome the President to address the nation. In all national day celebrations held since Uhuru and Ruto took power in 2013, that has been the culture. That was not the case in the 59th Madaraka Day fete held at Uhuru Gardens on June 1. After conferring state investiture to a list of Kenyans, the President went straight to address the nation. Tellingly, Uhuru also skipped his deputy as he recognised the dignitaries present. After the recognition of those present, Uhuru welcomed Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio, who is the chief guest, to address Kenyans. "Before I talk, I want to invite Sierra Leon president to make his remarks," Uhuru said. A programme of 59th Madaraka Day celebrations showed that Ruto was not accommodated in the programme. After the award of State investiture, the next item in the order was simply "State Address" after which the National Anthem was to be played then the ceremony comes to a closure.
