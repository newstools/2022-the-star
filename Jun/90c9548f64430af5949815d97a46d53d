Agriculture CS Peter Munya has alleged that allies of Deputy President William Ruto were awarded dam and road tenders in Nyambene but siphoned the funds. Munya said this was to punish President Uhuru Kenyatta’s regime and make Meru residents revolt against him. He said once Azimio la Umoja flagbearer Raila Odinga captures power he will accomplish all stalled projects. "We had hopes of road connectivity that would have eased residents' burden. We don’t want Udaku, it is a combination of cartels," Munya said. "They have made it impossible for us to have the Mikinduri-Kunati-Gacibine-Athi road among others in Tigania and Igembe regions. "Thangatha dam, Ura dam, Maua sewerage funds were siphoned. How would you trust them with the presidency?’’ Munya asked. However, he didn't mention those involved in the alleged misuse of development funds. Munya exuded confidence that Raila’s government will liberate the country from the high economic burden. The former Meru governor said Raila has given him another chance to serve Kenyans as the Agriculture CS if he wins, to continue with reforms in the sector. Munya said Raila had told him he would oversee urban development, SMEs, business, industry and rural development and urged residents to vote for the ODM leader to make the pledges a reality. “I was yearning to be Raila's running mate but even serving the same ministry will enable me empower more farmers and uplift business people," Munya said. "I am contented with Martha Karuabecause she is capable and we are now one team." Munya told residents that voting for Raila is equal to voting for him. He was, however, skeptical in campaigning for Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi, who is seeking re-election but urged the people to vote for whoever they want. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
