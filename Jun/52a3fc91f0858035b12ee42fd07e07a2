Pumpkin pie is still pretty unpopular in Kenya but why not give them a try this season and see what all the fuss is about. Try out this recipe for homemade fresh pumpkin pie and thank me later. Malenge can also be used to make chapati, bread or cooked with potatoes and beef. Pumpkins offer vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, and folate, all of which strengthen your immune system. More pumpkin in your diet can help your immune cells work better to ward off germs and speed healing when you get a wound. Time (Preparation & cooking): 1 hr. 30 min Ingredients Preparation STEP 1: Cut pumpkin in half lengthwise; discard seeds and bring to boil for 15-18 minutes or until very tender. STEP 2: In a 9-inch pie plate. Transfer pastry dough to fit the pie baking plate. Then Trim pastry to 1/2 inches beyond the edge of the plate, then push the pastry to the edges of the baking plate. STEP 3: Drain the pumpkin and set to cool. When cool enough to handle, scoop out pulp and mash. STEP 4: In a large bowl, combine the mashed pumpkin, cinnamon, salt, ginger, beaten eggs, brown sugar, and cloves. Then beat until smooth. STEP 5: Gradually beat in milk. Then Pour the custard into the pie plate with the pastry. STEP 6: Bake at 218 degrees for 15 minutes then reduce heat to 175°C, baking for 40-50 minutes longer until a knife or toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. STEP 7: Cover edges with foil during the last 30 minutes so as to prevent over-browning. If desired, have it with ice cream or apply whipped cream around the edge of the pie.
