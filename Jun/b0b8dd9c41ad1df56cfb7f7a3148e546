Several towns in Western and Mt Kenya region have been allocated a total of Sh11 billion for urban roads. The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) said Western Kenya towns which fall under the annuity programme lot 18 will get  Sh5 billion in the new financial year. KURA Director General Silas Kinoti, speaking at the authority's offices in  Nairobi, said the towns include Kakamega, Vihiga, Bungoma and Busia. Kinoti said construction of some of the roads has already begun. In Mt Kenya region, which falls under annuity lot 15,  Sh6 billion will be used in roads construction. The towns to benefit are Laikipia, Nanyuki,  Tharaka Nithi, Kathwana town , Embu town , Kerugoya , Nyeri town  and Murang'a town. Kinoti also added that KURA’S priorities include the implementation of the Intelligent Transport system ( ITS). This is an advanced application which aims at providing innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic management. It also enables users to be better informed and make safer, more coordinated, and 'smarter' decisions when using transport networks. He said the ITS project will help in better management of traffic. “We have prioritized the implementation of ITS phase 1 and 2 and BRT line 5 which is Outering   road,” he said. He added that KURA is appealing for financial support to expand the Karen –Ngong Road, dualling of the Northern bypass, Kiambu road and Limuru road. He said all these projects are at the planning stage and that the road agency intends to implement them in the new financial year. He said the Eastern bypass is also progressing well. Kinoti added that the authority will continue building roads in each county headquarter under the annuity programme. He called for more funding adding that urban roads are a catalyst for development .
