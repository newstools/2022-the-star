Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua has reiterated that confrontation is not their style of politics. Speaking shortly after Raila Odinga was cleared by IEBC to run for presidency on August 9, Karua said they will traverse the country in search of votes in a polite and respectful manner devoid of insults. “We want every Kenyan to know that we are respectful people to everyone. We are asking for votes politely because in the long run we want a peaceful country,” Karua said. The team held a rally at the Undugu Grounds in Lang'ata constituency Sunday afternoon. Karua said the Azimio coalition does not have time to spread hatred against their opponents. She however stated that they will not hesitate to point out a wrong in their opponents. "The truth will be told and if you are wrong, you have to be told off, but we do not do insults. "We will argue on the basis of ideas on how to push this country forward.” Karua said Raila's clearance marked the beginning of a two-month journey of rigorous campaigns to liberate Kenya for the third time. “It is only two months and we want to do whatever we can to make it not just a win, but a historical win,” Karua said.
