Ukrainian  coach Oleksandr Petrakov admitted that he was lost for words after the country's football team bowed out of World Cup qualifier at the hands of Wales on Monday in Cardiff. Ukraine lost 1-0 to bring to an agonising end their quest to qualify for the prestigious tournament despite displaying exemplary piece of football but one short of luck in front of goal. "I think we did everything that we could, but I really want people in Ukraine to remember our team's effort. I want to say sorry that we didn't score," Petrakov said. Wales head coach Rob Page was however full of praise for the team. "We just want to show our appreciation to them to what they are going through as a nation. "I thought the team were outstanding the two games and a lot of credit for doing what they have done and their support as well. We want to show them that respect."
