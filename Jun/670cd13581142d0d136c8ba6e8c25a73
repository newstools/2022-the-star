An officer stationed at Kwanza police station in Trans Nzoia County was on Thursday murdered in a bar fight with his colleague. A police report said the brawl happened at Kwanza Shopping mall leading to the death of Joseph Wanyangu. Gilbert Koech, the officer who reported the matter, said the deceased and the assailant were at the bar section of the bar. He said a quarrel ensued between Wanyangu and corporal Robert Mungei Nyakeri of Anti Stock Theft Unit (ASTU) over pending bills. Koech recounted that the dead officer had gone to the counter to inquire from Nyakeri why he refused to pay the bill, but Nyakeri pushed him. This prompted a hit with a beer bottle by one Peter Maundi Kirong, a teacher at Kwanza Boys High school in an attempt to rescue Wanyangu. "The fight escalated further outside the said bar about 20 metres where the deceased body was found lying dead," the report reads. Scene of Crime Officers from Kitale DCI established that the body of the deceased officer had multiple stab wounds on his back. Nyakeri was arrested in connection with the incident while the body was removed to Kitale county referral hospital mortuary awaiting an autopsy.
