DP William Ruto has outlined his housing plans to Kenyans when elected president in August polls. Speaking in Kasarani on Thursday, Ruto said he shall Increase supply of new housing to 250,000 per annum. "...and percentage of affordable housing supply from 2 percent to 50 percent," he said. "We will achieve this by structuring affordable long-term housing finance schemes, including a National Housing Fund and Cooperative Social Housing Schemes." Grow number of mortgages from 30,000 to 1,000,000 by enabling low -cost mortgages of Sh10,000 and below. Strengthen Jua Kali industry capacity to produce high quality construction productions. Give developers incentives to build more affordable housing. Kenya Kwanza commits to establish a Settlement Fund similar to the one that was used to acquire land from settler farmers after independence. Avoid the same problem of land fragmentation that we seek to solve. "We will get land that is not expensive or provide infrastructure to connect to that land," he said. The land purchased by the scheme will be subject to land use planning where beneficiaries will own transfer able residential plots in planned settlement and right to lease non-transferable agricultural land.
