Anti-riot police officers have been deployed at the Kenya School of Government, Mombasa to try and calm the former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's supporters. A four-hour standoff is still being witnessed after IEBC declined to clear Sonko for the Mombasa governor seat. A heavy deployment of police led by County police Commander Steve Matu has taken charge of the premises. Charged supporters of the flamboyant former Nairobi governor have threatened to storm the institution where Sonko's team is still challenging IEBC's decision to block his candidature. Chants of "Yote yawezekana bila Joho" and "No Sonko, no Raila" have filled the air. Sonko who arrived at the centre at 2:15 pm is yet to be cleared. It's past 6:30 pm and yet no sign of the stand off ending anytime soon. IEBC Mombasa returning officer Swalhah Ibrahim had declined to clear Sonko on grounds that he failed to present his degree certificate and certified copies of the degree. She had argued that Sonko had also contravened article 75 of the constitution.
