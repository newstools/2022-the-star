Strathmore Gladiators coach Meshack Senge believes proper game management will enable his charges bounce back to winning ways against Wazalendo in the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League match at the City Park Stadium, Sunday. Gladiators lost their last two matches, against Sailors and Kenya Police, while Wazalendo drew 1-1 with Mombasa Sports Club last weekend. "We poorly handled our last two matches and we conceded early first-quarter goals. We have worked on that and I also hope the team will defend well. In as much as we do not know what tomorrow holds, we will put our best foot forward," Senge said. MSC with one point, face a tricky affair against Western Jaguars on Saturday and USIU-A Mashujaa on Sunday in Nairobi. Jaguars, whose only win came against Police, will not underrate their opponents according to coach Mike Malungu. "They (MSC) will be psyched up to face us so we shouldn't take them lightly. We want to win to scale up the table," Malungu pointed out. Jaguars will welcome back Ivan Ludiali and Calistus Muyale from suspension. Defending champions Butali Warriors flex muscles with Sailors. Though they sit second on the log with 17 points, the Sugar millers are yet to lose a match as their title defense gathers momentum. In the men's Super League, Kisumu Youngsters host Kenya College of Accountancy University KCA-U, Nakuru play Sikh Union as Mombasa's Mvita aim to put Park Road Tigers to the sword. Mvita also go toe to toe with JKUAT as Parklands handle Technical University of Kenya TUK.
