Reports that the Teachers Service Commission has banned teachers from taking IEBC temporary jobs are fake. Fact-Checker has come across one such report indicating that teachers will not be allowed to take IEBC jobs. The report also indicated that TSC has directed school heads not to give the teachers permission to take the jobs. Fact-Checker has, however, debunked the reports and can authoritatively say they are false. TSC has not issued such a directive. The commission has also flagged one such report as fake. In a tweet with a screenshot of the fake report, TSC stated: "The attention of the Commission is drawn to this fake news. Treat it with the contempt it deserves". The misleading report came at a time when the IEBC is shortlisting candidates for various temporary jobs it advertised weeks ago. The advertised jobs included Presiding officers, Deputy Presiding officers and clerical jobs among others. Reliable sources have told Fact-Checker that many teachers across the country are among those who have made the shortlist. Those called for interviews are advised to attend as there is no gag order blocking them from taking the jobs if they become successful.
