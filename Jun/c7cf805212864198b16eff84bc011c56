Fast-rising East African hip hop and rap star artiste Young Lunya has officially joined the Sony Music Entertainment Africa Family. Speaking about his signing to Sony Music Africa, he said it is a dream come true. "I come from a part of the region where even talking about major labels was a myth, but I have always kept this dream and hope alive," he said. "I am excited that I am signed to Sony Music Entertainment because they represent some of the biggest artistes that I admire, like ASAP Rocky, Future, Travis Scott and many others." Young Lunya recently won Hip Hop Male Artiste of the Year and Best Song in the Hip Hop Category at the 2022 Tanzania Music Awards.
