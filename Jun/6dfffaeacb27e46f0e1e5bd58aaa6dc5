Deputy President William Ruto has said that he will deport Chinese nationals involved in retail businesses that can be done by Kenyans. According to the Daily Nation, the second in command said that if elected president on August 9, he will not let them engage in businesses such as roasting maize, selling in kiosks, among others. Speaking during the Kenya Kwanza Economic Forum in Nairobi, he said this will not happen, yet most Kenyans are struggling with unemployment. “These are Kenyan businesses and for those engaged in them, we have enough aeroplanes to deport them back to where they came from,” Ruto said. The DP noted that Kenya has agreements with other countries on the level of businesses and jobs that can be done by foreigners and locals. Ruto added that the agreements also specify where work permits are needed and where they are not. "That level is not selling in kiosks, retail or roasting maize,” he said. Ruto's remarks followed a concern by a trader who was present at the forum who said that the Chinese had invaded the retail market and were selling products cheaply, which threatens their existence as local business people. The DP's remarks were also reiterated by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria who insisted that they must not be allowed to do that, "because you cannot find a hawker in their country." Kuria added that the Chinese must also be reminded that the debt Kenya owes will have to be re-negotiated. "I support this Chinese issue and when the planes are full, we can put them in wheelbarrows. Is there an African hawker in Beijing? And I want to put them on notice, that we will not only send them away but the debt we owe them, we must sit down and discuss and restructure and reschedule," he said.
