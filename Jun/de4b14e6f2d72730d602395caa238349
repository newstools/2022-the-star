Nyeri governor aspirant on the New Democrats' party ticket Thuo Mathenge has been cleared by IEBC. Mathenge was cleared to vie for the Nyeri Governor seat after confirmation of his degree certificate from the Presbyterian University of East Africa. Speaking to Star on Monday, Mathenge pointed a finger at his opponents whom he accused of plotting his downfall. He maintained that his certificates are genuine contrary to earlier reports by the IEBC. “We don’t have any problem with IEBC now since they have cleared us to vie,” Thuo said. He said he graduated in 2019 with second class upper division from Presbyterian University. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) last week warned the electoral commission against clearing 241 aspirants for the August 9 General Election over integrity issues. In a statement, the anti-graft agency asked IEBC to take into consideration the integrity issues before clearing the aspirants, among them, sitting and former governors and MPs.
