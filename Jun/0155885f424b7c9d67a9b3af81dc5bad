A video clip going viral on social media showing a crowd endorsing Deputy President William Ruto for the presidency at a rally attended by ODM leader Raila Odinga is edited. The video clip has been shared widely on social media misleading Kenyans about what really happened at the rally. Fact-Checker has established that the original video clip was of a rally convened by Raila in Isiolo county on Tuesday. In the edited video clip,  Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli was addressing a crowd during which he asked them who they will vote for the top seat come August 9. The response of the crowd, in the edited clip, mentioned Ruto's name. Fact-checker has, however, discovered that during the rally, the crowd endorsed Raila in response to Atwoli's question and not Ruto. With a few weeks to the August polls, you are advised to rely on information from credible media houses to avoid being misled by political players who will deliberately pass the wrong message for their advantage. Leading Presidential candidates Raila and Ruto do cover their events live on Facebook hence one can follow their verified pages to get the true affairs of their events as they unfold. You can also use their live videos to debunk fishy information being propagated about their rallies.
