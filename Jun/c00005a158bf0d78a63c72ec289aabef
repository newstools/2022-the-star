Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto on Wednesday hinted that Tharaka Nithi Senator, Kithure Kindiki will succeed him in 2032. Speaking during an economic forum in Tharaka Nithi County, the DP told residents that he was still mentoring Kindiki for the big seat. Ruto told the residents not to be angry that Kindiki missed out on the running mate slot, saying that he was still young and big prepared for the "big assignment". “When I came here I told you to let this man go and help me in national politics because he has bygone the post of being a senator or that of a governor,” he explained. "Speaker Muturi, Gachagua and I are ageing. When we will be leaving, we will leave the mantle of leadership to the young generation. But then, we have to guide and mentor the young in preparation for the leadership roles. After we are done with our 10 years it will be their turn. Are we in agreement?" He added that Kindiki is the third in the pecking order of the UDA party saying he is beyond county politics. “Kwa ile orodha ya UDA, yule nambari moja ni hustler, nambari ya pili ni Gachagua halafu Kindiki…sasa mtu mwenye atakuwa nambari ya tatu kule national mnataka kumfungia yeye hapa?” he posed. (In our pecking order, I am at the top followed by Gachagua and Kindiki…so why should you people continue someone who is ranked the third here?
