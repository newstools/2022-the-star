A fifty-five-year-old man escaped death narrowly on Tuesday night in Nyeri County after he snatched a firearm from a robber who had attacked him. Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti said Irungu Mwangi wrestled down the assailant and snatched the firearm from him. "Irungu was walking home at around 8 pm last night, and on reaching Chaka primary school, he was accosted by a gunman who pointed an AK-47 assault rifle to his chest and ordered him to lie down," Kinoti said. Irungu obliged, and when the thug demanded money, he fished out the only Sh200 note and handed it to him. The thug demanded more money, but Irungu kept telling him that that was all he had. Unconvinced, the thug bent forward and began ransacking Irungu’s pockets. He stepped on his back with one foot and placed the firearm on the ground. It was at this point that Irungu shoved the assailant to the ground and grabbed the firearm, leading to a brief scuffle as the thug tried to regain control of the firearm in vain. The thug later escaped before the police arrived at the scene. Police established that the firearm, serial number AK47 S/No. KP 4915512 with a magazine loaded with 15 rounds of 7.62mm special, was stolen from Nairutia police station in Kieni West Sub-county, on April 15, 2022, and reported vide OB 05/18/04/2022 at the same station. Also recovered at the scene was a police beret belonging to the Administration Police Service. A manhunt for the suspect is ongoing
