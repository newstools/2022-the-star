The 2021 men’s Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League playoffs have been declared null and void by the Sports Dispute Tribunal. In a ruling delivered on Wednesday, SDT stated that KBF violated the League and Competition rules with Lakeside awarded the win against Ulinzi Warriors. Kenya Morans’ head of Covid-19, Dennis Achiego, filed a case with the SDT on April 13, calling for the Warriors to be disqualified after they used an ineligible player in their quarter-finals tie against Lakeside. The soldiers won the contentious game against the Kisumu side 2-1 in the best of three series to proceed to the semi-finals. Ulinzi will face a fine in accordance with the League and Competition rules as the KBF meet the cost of restarting the playoffs. The ruling also recommends full investigations pertaining to the forged score sheet with KBF meeting the cost of the petition. KBF secretary Ambrose Kisoi said they were due to meet as a federation and find the way forward on the issue. “We will meet and deliberate after which we will talk to our lawyer and give direction,” said Kisoi. “Another thing we will look at is to continue with the new season that is already ongoing even as we play the semis.” Lakeside will play Strathmore University Blades who lost to Ulinzi Warriors in the semis. Kenya Ports Authority, who have crowned the champions will then battle the winners in a fresh final. The ongoing 2022 season tipped off three weeks ago.
