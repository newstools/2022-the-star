After plotting the fall of the Kenya Ports Authority, Africa Nazarene University coach Mike Oluoch now plans to bring down their next opponent. The newly-promoted Wolf-packs, who shocked KPA 73-63 in a Kenya National Basketball League, have their morale high as they focus on the next assignment. He said he was to meet former champions Ulinzi Warriors this weekend but the fixture has since been rescheduled. “We need to correct the mistakes we made in defence. Our rotation under the rim was slow and we must reduce our turnovers. The boys played well, they were composed and they followed instructions which made the game flow smoothly,” Oluoch said. He added: “Most of the players were sick and God saw us through. We thank God for the game and for the win.” Rattled KPA tactician Sammy Kiki said it was a wake-up call for the porters and they will now put that loss behind them and focus ahead. “Any team that plays us will always come strong on us. We also underrated them and we didn’t have the urgency of playing defence,” he said. “Our execution was not good... we just played badly. We will keep our heads high and rectify our mistakes and focus on our next games.” The dockers shocker against ANU was their first loss in their opening two games of the season. They dismissed Strathmore University Blades 54-46.
