Kariobangi Sharks goalkeeper, Brian Olang'o, has left the country for tryouts with Egyptian top-tier clubs. Olang'o severed ties with the Kenyan Premier League club at the peak of his two-year stint after joining them in September 2020 from KCB. The club confirmed the player's departure in a statement carried on their social media pages. “Exit. After 2 seasons of service, Brian Olang'o has left the club having made six appearances in all competitions. Thanks, Olang'o and good luck,” the club tweeted. Olang'o thanked the club for allowing him to prove his mettle in top-flight football. “I want to take this opportunity to thank the entire Kariobangi Sharks family and fans for the support and the opportunity they gave me to showcase my ability,” Olang'o said. “It is hard to say goodbye to a place I've called home over the past few years. To the players and members of the technical bench, I say God bless you till we meet again."
