Nakuru Town West MP Samuel Arama has been sentenced to six months in jail or in default, Sh1.5 million fine. This is after he was found guilty of conspiring to grab Sh60 Million parcel of land. Magistrate Victor Wakumile on Thursday sentenced Arama and his co-accused after they were found guilty of grabbing the said land. In his ruling, Wakumile said he had considered the legislator's mitigation and had been guided by the policy guideline in his sentencing. He said the accused had to be condemned adding that the property in question had been restored so Arama never benefited from it. “I hereby sentence the accused to pay Sh260,000 per count each in default to serve six months in prison,” the court. The court also noted that Arama and his co-accused are first offenders and the title deed in question was surrendered to the owner therefore they did not benefit.
