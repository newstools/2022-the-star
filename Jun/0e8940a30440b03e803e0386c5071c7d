Nyashinski's wife Zia Bett has paid tribute to her late sister, Janet Bett- Karoney, on her first birthday in heaven. Zia shared two photos of her lovely sister, wishing that she had spent more time with her. "Happy 1st heavenly birthday @juicydiaries! I know Heaven needed more angels, which is why they called you there," Zia wrote. "I just wish they delayed a bit longer. I miss you every day, but especially today. I know we will meet again in Eternity. I love you so much. Happy birthday, my sweet sister and best friend." The mother of one succumbed to a rare condition known as severe aplastic anaemia, leaving behind her husband and a child. Before her death, Janet Bett wrote her eulogy, celebrating her biggest milestones and relationships.
