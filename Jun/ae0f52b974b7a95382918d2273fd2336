Six people early Saturday killed and eight others injured at Degogicha in Isiolo county after heavily armed bandits raided a village and made away with unknown number of livestock. The bandits struck at dawn killing three members of a family; a mother, two children aged three and ten years and injured the father. They killed three other people and injured seven others in a fierce gunfight with residents which lasted for hours as they drove away the livestock. Isiolo County Commissioner Geoffrey Omonding confirmed the incident saying a contingent of police officers has been deployed to track down  the suspected raiders. He said those injured have been admitted at Merti health facility while others have been referred to Isiolo general hospital with serious gunshot wounds. Isiolo gubernatorial aspirant Abdi Guyo termed the incident as unfortunate and called on security agencies to move with speed and avert further killings. On March, five people were killed following clashes between two pastoral communities in Degogicha location. On June 10, three herdsmen were and seven others seriously injured in a dawn banditry attack at Chinchoftu in Cherab ward Isiolo county. Guyo regretted that the county is facing serious security issues and called for deployment of more Kenya police reservists to deter attackers from neighbouring counties. "We lost more than ten lives and 13 others are nursing gunshot wounds due to senseless killing and banditry attack in a span of a week" Guyo said.
