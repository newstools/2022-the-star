The battle for the Bondo constituency Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ticket is now over. This was confirmed by the Bondo Constituency Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Returning Officer Dennis Obara. Obara on Friday said that incumbent MP Gideon Ochanda was cleared by the poll agency on May 31, 2022, as the ODM nominee. "Mr Ochanda was cleared on May 31 but we invited him back today for the signing of a sample ballot paper," Obara said. Ochanda said that he had confirmed his details in the sample ballot paper and okayed them for use in the August 9 general election. Ochanda was announced the winner of the ODM primaries through universal suffrage on April 13, 2022. However, one of his competitors Andiwo Mwai petitioned the Orange party claiming a lack of credibility and fairness. "I have been in ODM but I have never seen a long protracted court battle like the one that I got embroiled in. It was as if I, as the ODM aspirant, was fighting my own party," Ochanda said. Ochanda thanked the people of Bondo for remaining calm as the matter was being settled. He urged other aspirants who may still want to go to court to save the people from anxiety over who their next MP will be. Meanwhile, the lawmaker said that elections in Kenya are now a life and death matter and the IEBC should be extremely careful with the poll management. "Right now the IEBC is denying that close to a million voters have been removed from the register yet the initial information was that they were lost. If there is a mistake, the public should know exactly what kind of solution they are coming up with," he said.
