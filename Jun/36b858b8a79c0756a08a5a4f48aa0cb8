Kenya Sevens' stars Johnstone Olindi and Alvin Otieno will play for KCB at the Driftwood Sevens slated for June 18-19 in Mombasa. The duo missed the opening legs of the Kabeberi and Christie Sevens due to commitments with the Shujaa. KCB Sevens coach Dennis Mwanja said the two will be a big boost to the team. “Olinda and Otieno selection will be a big boost as we explore various combinations and look at bouncing back after we lost to Strathmore during the Christie sevens final,” he said. Mwanja's charges won the Kabeberi Sevens after beating Strathmore 12-10 but a week later lost to the varsity side 15-10 at the Christie Sevens final. Otieno's return is a big boost with veteran Jacob Ojee joining the Simbas squad for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers slated for France next month. Mwanja said the team will work on ball handling, concentration,  communication and perfect other areas ahead of the trip to Mombasa. "We had a lot of handling errors at Christie Sevens. Lapses of concentration and our communication in the defence was poor. We want to sort all these areas before traveling to the coast," said Mwanja. He said the race for the seven-circuit will be competitive and his charges can't rest on their laurels with four tournaments remaining. “ It will be tough. Teams like Strathmore,  Oilers, Mwamba and Homeboyz are formidable and the moment you get complacent you get punished,” he added. The former international said the side can handle the pressure of the circuit, especially with Strathmore also in contention. “We have a very experienced group of players in the setup and the hunger and desire to do well is still there,” he said. The bankers face rivals Kabras, Daystar Falcons, and Pirates in Pool B of the Driftwood Sevens. KCB and Strathmore are tied at 41 points each after two rounds of the National Sevens circuit.
