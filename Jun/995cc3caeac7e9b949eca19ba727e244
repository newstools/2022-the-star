Azimio flagbearer Raila Odinga is the most preferred presidential candidate if elections were held now, an opinion poll by Infotrak Research and Consulting shows. The survey conducted in all the 290 constituencies said 42 per cent of the respondents would vote for Raila while 38 per cent named Deputy president William Ruto as their preferred candidate. The poll said Raila would garner 9.3 million votes and Ruto 8.4 million votes. None of the two candidates would secure fifty plus one to be declared winner, the poll said. It added that Raila would lead in 20 counties while Ruto would be ahead in 16. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus one. A total of 9,000 respondents were interviewed between 23-27 May.
