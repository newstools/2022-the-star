Kilifi County senatorial aspirant on Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) party ticket Benjamin Kai Chilumo has dismissed graft allegations levelled against him by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC). According to EACC, Kai defrauded the Kilifi County government Sh250 million, while serving as a Finance Chief Officer. However, Kai said he is not aware of the allegations, saying that the reports are fake and aimed at tarnishing his name and political image. Speaking in his office in Kilifi town on Friday, Kai said he had served the people of Kilifi County diligently for the eight-year period he served as Finance and Planning Chief Officer. The senatorial hopeful said he has no corruption records against him during his tenure at the county government. "I was among the first whistleblowers of the first Sh51 million shillings that the county government was said to have been stolen back in 2015," he said He said during his time as the chief officer, he reported the Sh51 million scandal to the relevant authorities including EACC and other anti-fraud agencies. Kai said he was shocked to hear his name was among the list of those investigated by EACC, adding that he got the news only through the media. "There was no official communication from EACC to me instead I just heard my name from the media which indicated how this matter was being handled politically," he said. Kai said so far he has been cleared by IEBC to contest for the senatorial position in Kilifi. "I was cleared two days ago by IEBC to run for the senatorial position in Kilifi and today EACC puts me on the list of shame, How is that?" asked Kai. The senatorial candidate however said the issue might be having a hand from his political opponents, who intend to reduce his political popularity in Kilifi. Kai called on his supporters to shun the ongoing propaganda on corruption and focus on changing Kilifi for the better.
