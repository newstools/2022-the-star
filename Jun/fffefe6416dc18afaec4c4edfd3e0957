Thirdway Alliance presidential hopeful Ekuru Aukot has been disqualified from the presidential race for failing to provide supporters' signature at the Bomas of Kenya on Saturday. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said that Aukot also failed to provide ID copies of his supporters. Aukot failed to provide signatures and copies of national identity cards of 48,000 registered voters who endorsed his presidential bid. The same fate befell Independent Presidential aspirant, George Munyottah who failed to submit the minimum number of supporters' IDs and signatures. Aukot protested the requirement, saying it was impractical of the IEBC to ask for supporters’ signatures and copies of IDs from the contestants. Aukot argued that he ran for presidency in the 2017 General Election, and that during clearance, he wasn’t asked to produce any signatures or ID cards proving his endorsement by Kenyans. “No Kenyan is willing to give you his ID card to photocopy, let us be realistic. "I’m even wondering where the cleared candidates got the photocopied ID cards of Kenyans from,” he said. Aukot said that they deliberately decided not to bring the signatures. "People want to be bribed so that they can give you their ID cards to photocopy,”Aukot said. He said he will challenge the ID and signatures requirement in court. In April, Aukot wanted to block Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga from vying in the August polls on grounds that he is a public servant.
