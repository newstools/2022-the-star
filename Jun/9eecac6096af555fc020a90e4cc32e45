Lentils are much underrated, they are fast and easy to cook, not forgetting the deliciousness. Lentils do not require pre-boiling but can be soaked in order to reduce cooking time by about half. Before cooking, rinse lentils in cold water, pick over to remove debris or shrivelled lentils, then drain. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Using a mesh colander, rinse the lentils well, strain and set aside. In a large skillet, heat oil and add diced onion and carrots. Cook for 4-5 minutes until onions are translucent and carrots are tender. Step 2 Add in minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 1 minute. Add curry powder and ground cumin, and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant. Step 3 Add rinsed and strained lentils to the pan, and stir quickly to coat the lentils in spice and onion mixture. Step 4 Pour in water and coconut milk, and stir to ensure everything is well combined. Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook on low for 30 minutes until lentils are tender and the sauce has thickened. Step 5 After 30 minutes, add chopped spinach to the curry, cover again and cook for another 5 minutes. The spinach should wilt down into the lentils, it might need to be stirred a little to encourage it. Remove curry from the heat and give it a good stir to ensure everything is well mixed together. Season to taste as needed. Serve curry with a side of basmati rice or chapati and a sprinkle of coriander.
