Police in Nigeria on Friday arrested a businessman for allegedly attempting to kill his daughter for a ritual. Evans Oppong, 42, a resident of Fise near Amasaman, was nabbed after police got word that he took his 11-year-old daughter to a traditional priest at Oyibi Kom in Accra, for ritual purposes on Thursday. "We are grateful to the patriotic citizen who provided the information leading to the arrest for his selfless service which saved the life of the child involved," the police said. They also said that the victim was safe and they were working to reunite her with her family. "Meanwhile, the suspect is in police custody assisting with the investigation," they added. Nana Adu-Boafo Jnr, the herbalist, said he was shocked when Oppong brought him his daughter claiming he wanted her sacrificed for money. It prompted him to alert the police. "He promised me 10,000 GHc and other good surprises after the ritual," Boafo Jnr said in a Facebook post. He told the police, Oppong had told him that he travelled to Nigeria for greener pastures, in an effort to make more money. Oppong is said to have pulled his daughter out of school claiming he wanted to take her out for cloth shopping. Boafo said that the man had also planned to sacrifice his other child, as he is a father of 12. "This is a bad man with many evil intentions. He doesn't feel anything for his own girl," Boafo said. The case will be heard on June 20, 2022.
