Africa Concours d’Elegance organisers are hoping to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the event on September 25 in style. Speaking during the official launch of the event in Nairobi, Alfa Romeo Owners Club of Kenya chairman Peter Wanday said several foreign entries have been confirmed for the event including five motorcycles from South Africa, a car from Tanzania and 15 motorbikes from Uganda. Wanday also noted that the increased international interest is expected to spice up what is anticipated to be their greatest event in history. "Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to host the last two editions in 2020 and 2021. But we are now headed back for Ngong Racecourse for the 2022 edition and we hope to be back in a big way to mark the Golden Jubilee Celebrations," Wanday said. Launching the event, Sports Cabinet Secretary Amb (Dr) Amina Mohamed at the Panafric Hotel predicted a full entry of 70 cars and 40 motorcycles. Among the notable entries are the 1990 Lancia Delta Integrale which will be driven down the judging line by Tanzanian enthusiasts. Among other notable entries from outside Kenya is Kakoozar Wazir who will be driving from Kampala to contest the event. Tumaini Muthiga, a regular in the event, will have a busy day rushing from the car judging line to the motorcycles. He has entered a 1967 Ford and a Harley Davidson motorcycle. "The international status of the event continues to market the country as a potential sporting destination. We hope other sporting disciplines in the country will emulate Alfa Romeo Owners Club's spirit of fairness." A total of 40 entries have been received so far with a few months to the iconic event.
