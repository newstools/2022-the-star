Nairobi governor candidate Polycarp Igathe on Thursday claimed that the recent polls that showed he was trailing his main rival are fake and funded by politicians to create a perception. Speaking to a local media during the KEPSA meeting at Kempinski, Igathe said that he will win in August polls with over 1.2 million votes. "Tifa polls are lies told by liars... I don't even read it," he said. The Azimio governor candidate pointed out that the Kamba nation, the Luhyas, Luos and the Kikuyus are all behind him. "How are we going to lose to Sakaja? They must be completely out of their minds," he added. Igathe is contesting for the position against Kenya Kwanza's Johnson Sakaja and other independent candidates. On Monday, Tifa announced that Sakaja was leading in the race for the Nairobi top seat. "Regarding the gubernatorial and senatorial contests, the former is now a much closer race than it was two months ago, with Senator Johnson Sakaja of UDA only slightly ahead of his main opponent, Jubilee’s Polycarp Igathe (40 per cent vs. 32 per cent)," it read. It also showed that Sakaja has higher female support as compared to Igathe. Of 41 per cent female supporters are backing Sakaja's bid while 24 per cent support Igathe. Some 632 respondents were interviewed on June 20, 2022. The poll had a margin of error +/- 3.8 per cent. Igathe noted that he is a professional marketer and a member of the Marketing Research Association, adding that is a shame what the researchers are doing. He added that Nairobi will be freed from corrupt leaders.
