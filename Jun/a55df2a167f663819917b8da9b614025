Jubilee party secretary-general Jeremiah Kioni has expressed the party's satisfaction with Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance manifesto. While speaking in Embu on Tuesday during his visit to the party candidates, Kioni said the manifesto is set to continue with Jubilee's projects and vision. "Azimio manifesto was impressive because it has included everything we hoped to implement as the Jubilee administration," said Kioni. Kioni said that the manifesto will benefit the Mt Kenya region through the continuation of the proposed projects by the Jubilee party in favour of the region. The Ndaragwa Member of National Assembly said the Azimio manifesto is set to increase the resources allocation to Mt Kenya region by over Sh50 billion. He added that the manifesto also highlighted the issue of increasing the number of constituencies in the Mt Kenya region counties. "Jubilee administration had aimed at initiating several projects which included increasing funds allocation by over Sh50 billion and taking care of constituencies," said the secretary-general. Kioni also lauded the free education offer saying it will offload the burden facing many Kenyans who are battling the high cost of education. Azimio la Umoja manifesto was unveiled on Monday night in a colourful event at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. The Azimio la Umoja Presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua unveiled the 10-point agenda that their government will implement should they be voted for in the August 9 polls.
