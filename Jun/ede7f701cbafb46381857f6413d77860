"We had cleared Kisia, Valentine, Ruth and now evening we have just finalized with Philgona as candidates for the women representative positions," he told the media. However, Ruth told the media that she was looking forward to being cleared by IEBC and now they will start their campaigns across the county. " We are going to do a thorough campaign crisscrossing the county, moving door to door to ensure that come August, the victory is ours," she said. She also urged for peaceful campaigns across from all the politicians. Ayugi who is vying on UDA, however, said it was a great day for her and remained confident that she will also clinch the seat. "Am a Christian and I want to urge my opponent to ensure that we maintain peace during this entire campaign period," she added.
