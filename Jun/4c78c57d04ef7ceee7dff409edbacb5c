After 27 years, Microsoft is officially pulling the plug on one of its oldest browsers, Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer was first released in 1995, when Bill Gates decided to install the browser with Windows. According to the company, Internet Explorer will retire from Wednesday June 15 and those who attempt to open the application will be redirected to Microsoft Edge, their recent browser. “Change was necessary, but we didn’t want to leave reliable, still-functioning websites and applications behind. We’re here to help you transition to the more comprehensive browsing experience of Microsoft Edge and tell you a bit more about why we think it will address your needs, both at home and at work,” they said in a statement. Microsoft Edge was introduced in 2015 and has gradually phased out Internet Explorer, however, it still faces competition on Google’s Chrome which is in most mobile operating systems.
