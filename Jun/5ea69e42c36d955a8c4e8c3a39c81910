GEORGE MUGO/ The state has formed a special police unit to deal with politicians inciting citizens to violence, during and after polls. National Security and Administration Committee chairman Peter Mwathi has said the Ministry of Interior and the police have already mapped out areas they suspect might be hotspots, and will deploy the units if need arises. Mwathi, who is also the Limuru MP, on Monday said the government aims to ensure peace and security prevails countrywide. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s government cannot and will not sit back and wait to see the country being torn down by chaos from a few individuals over their own interests. The legislator said the government has employed enough police officers, who are are collecting information regarding security daily. “The special unit officers will protect the country with zeal and zest. No one who will try to cause mayhem will be spared. We cannot sit down and watch the country burn,” he said. Mwathi, who was cleared on Monday to defend his seat on a Jubilee Party ticket, asked residents to consider re-electing him. He said he needs to finish some of the projects he had started. “We have done so much with residents in terms of education, roads, sports and youth and women empowerment. Give me another chance and you will never regret,” Mwathi said. The legislator will face off with former MP John Kiragu (UDA), Bibirioni MCA Jacquie Nungari (Chama Cha Kazi), Wanjiru wa Ndungu (Narc Kenya) and independent candidate Phillip Mbugua.
