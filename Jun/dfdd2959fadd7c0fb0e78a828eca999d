Safina presidential candidate Jimi Wanjigi has been denied clearance by the IEBC to run for the presidency. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati cited failure to meet the requisite signatures and failure to submit copies of IDs of supporters who endorsed his presidential bid. "We have allowed others who have problems with signatures to harmonise, and we can also allow you in the remaining hours to do so," Chebukati said. "But you must bring a physical copy of your degree certificate before I clear you," he added. Chebukati said Wanjigi attached transcripts of his education contrary to the regulations which states that each of the candidate must submit a certificate from a recognised institution in the country. He further stated that there was inconsistencies on the ID cards he presented. But Wanjigi read mischief in the decision arguing that the commission was applying double standards in clearing candidates. "It is very clear what is going on here. There is a very clear mchujo (sieving) that is being decided elsewhere not here," Wanjigi said. He claimed that some presidential candidates were cleared by the commission without question after they submitted their documents in a similar format as him. "You cannot apply different rules to different people. And if this is the intention and your direction as a commission then I fear greatly for the coming election," Wanjigi said. He maintained that he had fulfilled all the statutory requirements and even had a pre-nomination conference with the commission and was assured that all his documents were in order. Chebukati, however, firmly told Wanjigi to use the dispute resolution process if he feels aggrieved. "This is my decision and if you have any issues we have dispute resolution committee," Chebukati said.
