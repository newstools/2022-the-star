President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday presided over the 2022 National Youth Service (NYS) recruits pass-out parade. The parade was held at  NYS Gilgil Campus in Nakuru County. Uhuru was received at the college by Public Service CS Margaret Kobia, NYS Director-General Matilda Sakwa, and College Commandant Nicholas Makokha. Speaking, Uhuru said the government has upscaled their absorption of NYS service men and women into the discipline services and other private and public agencies. "I am glad that after my directive of last year, the administration has secured 2,649 job placements for NYS graduates," he said. The President added that KDF and NPS have recruited 500 NYS graduates each, Kenya Prisons 61 and Kenya Airport Authority concluded their interviews for 200. The 9,464 recruits are graduating after a six-month paramilitary and character development course. They are expected to proceed for community service before being absorbed into the NYS vocational training. In 2021, the number of recruited graduates was 7,479.
