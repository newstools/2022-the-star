Fans and family of the late Alex Ndawula, one of the pioneer DJs in Uganda, have described him as a legend. Alex died on Monday at the age of 59. A fan identified as Charles Onyango-Obbo, while paying tribute, said Alex was the original rulebook breaker. "He was a norm defier – and in the process changed radio in Uganda forever," he wrote. The cause of his death is still unknown, although he had been hospitalised for some time. Ndawula started his career at Sanyu Radio before moving to Capital FM in the early 90s. Alex was famous for his dance force mixes. He retired from Capital FM in May 2017 after over 20 years at the station and 40 years of service.
