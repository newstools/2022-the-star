Unsettled IDPs in Nyamira, who were displaced by the 2007-08 election violence are now demanding to be resettlement or boycott the August 9 general elections. For 15 years, the Internally Displaced Persons have been camping at the county commissioner’s office demanding resettlement. “We have been in the tents for the last fifteen years and we have been surviving by the grace of God. We are not going to entertain any more lies,”  Juliet Moraa who was displaced from Molo, in Nakuru county said. The IDP's led by Momanyi Agwata have said they should be paid their compensation before the election day or else they will not vote. “We know a time will come when leaders will be giving us false promises to get our vote but they should be informed that it will not happen. We resolved that none of us is going to vote until we are resettled," Agwata said. They have been complaining for two years about delays in getting their compensation and even with regular follow-ups, nothing has been done to ensure they get their right. North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko called upon county commissioner Michael Lesmam and Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i to intervene and ensure the IDPs are compensated. “We are aware during the Mashujaa Day celebrations in Kisii a year ago, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave out money to settle the issue of IDPs once and for all." Nyamoko said. "We don't know whether there were cartels that diverted the money to their pockets and it did not reach the IDPs." (Edited by Tabnacha O)
