Aston Villa have turned backup goalkeeper Robin Olsen's loan move from AS Roma into a permanent deal, the Premier League club said on Saturday. Sweden international Olsen spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and made his debut in their 3-2 defeat at Manchester City on the final day of the league season. Villa have moved swiftly to secure signings for the next season after finishing 14th in the 2021-22 campaign. They have signed defensive midfielder Boubacar Kamara on a free transfer from Olympique de Marseille, made Philippe Coutinho's loan move from Barcelona permanent and brought in defender Diego Carlos from Sevilla. Meanwhile, former Argentina striker Carlos Tevez confirmed late on Friday that he has retired from professional soccer, one year after leaving Buenos Aires club Boca Juniors citing burnout. The 38-year-old said on a national TV show in Argentina that he would no longer play professionally. Known as 'El Apache', Tevez began his career at Boca and had successful stints with Corinthians. He moved to England in 2006, where he played for Premier League sides West Ham United, Manchester United and Manchester City, before moving to Italy to join Juventus. Tevez had two more stints with his hometown club Boca on either side of a spell with Chinese Super League team Shanghai Shenhua. He made 75 appearances for the Argentine national side and won an Olympic gold medal at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
