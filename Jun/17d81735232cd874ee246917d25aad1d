President Uhuru Kenyatta has officially been received in Lisbon, Portugal, by his host President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Uhuru is on a two-day State Visit to the southern European country. Uhuru was received by his Portuguese host at the iconic Jerónimos Monastery in central Lisbon in an elaborate military ceremony that included a Guard of Honour and a Gun Salute by the Forças Armada (The Portuguese Armed Forces). Jerónimos Monastery, which President Kenyatta toured extensively, is an imposing masterpiece of 16th-century Portuguese architecture. It is also a global monument where the remains of renowned Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and poet Luís de Camões are interred. Kenyatta later took a short drive, escorted by a ceremonial cavalry of horse riders, to the nearby Belém Palace, the official residence of the Portuguese President. The two leaders led their respective delegations in bilateral talks and addressed the media.
