Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has lashed out at EACC boss Twalib Mbarak over his response to her calls for impartiality in the war against corruption. In a tweet on Friday, Waiguru termed Twalib's remarks as reckless after the anti-graft czar termed her complaints on the fight against corruption as shameful. "You're supposed to be an impartial investigator, not a peddler of “everyone knows” village shopping centre narratives. "Produce evidence if you have it not the info that is politically instigated by your Harambee house masters. As I've always said Kenya is a nation of law not might," Waiguru said. On June 1, the EACC blacklisted 241 aspirants and asked the IEBC not to clear them saying they are unfit to vie for public office. Waiguru, former Nairobi Governors Evans Kidero and Mike Mbuvi Sonko are among the notable names EACC named on the red list. In response, Waiguru said were it not for Constitutional safeguards that separate investigations, prosecution and adjudication, the EACC would have hanged them over politically instigated allegations. In his response to Waiguru's comments, Twalib said her social standing on corruption was in the public domain. "Governor Anne Waiguru's comments are extremely shameful, as Kenyans know her well, including her social standing on integrity." But Waiguru termed the response as shocking and irresponsible and asked the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission Chief Executive to exercise professionalism. "You hold a constitutional Cap 15 office that demands highest level of impartiality and professionalism. Your reckless response on such a matter proves your unworthiness to hold such a serious office," she said.
