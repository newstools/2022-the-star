Diamond Platnumz is currently in Nairobi just hours after his baby mama Zari Hassan arrived. Diamond Platnumz silently jetted into the country that same Wednesday. Although he posted on his Insta story, the veteran superstar did not reveal details of his visit. Sources say the two ex-lovers are in the city for business and to shoot an episode of the 'Young, Famous and African' reality show. Speaking to the press, Zari said she is in Kenya for business. "I’m also supposed to be working with the governor’s (Mike Sonko's) wife, and we are supposed to visit children’s homes," she said. "Me coming to Kenya and not tapping into that would not be a Zari visit. I love the Kenyan food, that’s ugali, nyama choma and sukuma wiki."
