The High court in a Judicial review case has suspended the Commission for University Education's decision to revoke the recognition of Senator Johnson Sakaja's degree. The court directed CUE to maintain the validity of Sakaja's degree pending further direction by the court. "An Order of Certiorari to remove into this honourable court and quash the decision of the Commission for University Education Made on 14th June, 2022, revoking the recognition of the applicant's(Sakaja) degree from Teams University, Kampala, Uganda," the court reads in part. The High Court has also blocked the IEBC from striking out the name of Sakaja from the list of candidates cleared to vie for the governor seat. Sakaja moved to court on Wednesday evening to quash the CUE's move to revoke recognition of his degree. The major orders he sought at the court have all been granted. CUE had revoked recognition of Sakaja's degree citing numerous complaints. A letter from the Commission dated June 14, 2022, said it had received material information about the authenticity of the Bachelor of Science in Management degree. The commission said the degree will further be investigated to ascertain its validity. “Consequently, in accordance with the CUE recognition procedures, we hereby revoke the recognition of your degree from the aforementioned university,” CUE chairman Chacha Nyaigoti Chacha said. The commission had on June 6 written to the senator confirming the recognition of the certificate.
