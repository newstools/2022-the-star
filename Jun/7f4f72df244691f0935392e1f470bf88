A 17-year-old girl was on Monday found stranded at Kanduyi in Bungoma town. Marceline Situma, 17, told the press that she used to stay in Nairobi with a woman whom she thought was her mother. The class seven girl divulged that things went south a few days ago after she asked the woman about her birth certificate while preparing to register for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE). A birth certificate is a mandatory requirement for the registration exercise. Situma narrated that the woman was unable to provide the birth certificate saying she opted to confess to her that she was not her mother. “I have been staying with my stepmother since I was a small girl. Things fell apart when I wanted to prepare for the KCPE exam registration. That is the time I knew she was not my parent,” she said. According to Situma, the woman told her that she found her with her father when she got married to him years back. It is during their marriage that Situma's father is said to have abandoned the two and went to Bungoma where his ancestral home is perceived to be. The revelation prompted the pupil to embark on a journey to Bungoma in search of her dear father in the company of the woman. On arrival to Bungoma, however, Situma's stepmother is said to have excused herself but went missing never to be seen again. “I don't know what happened after we alighted. My stepmother disappeared in unclear circumstances and I don’t know her whereabouts,” Situma noted. It is after the dramatic turn of events that Situma found herself alone with nowhere to go. She now appeals to members of the public to help her trace her family. Situma was picked by a Good Samaritan Catherine Nafula who took custody of her as she continues with the search for her father.
