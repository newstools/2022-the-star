If you have been on a group call with someone that just won’t stop talking, you now have the ability to mute them with WhatsApp’s new feature. In addition to muting individual users, you can also send messages to specific people while on a group call that involves up to the maximum of eight people on video calls or up to 32 on voice calls. The feature was announced by Will Cathcart who is the head of WhatsApp at Meta through Twitter. In addition to the features, WhatsApp is also rolling out a new banner that will alert you when someone new has joined the call after it already started. On Friday, WhatsApp announced that you can now choose which contacts can see your profile photo, about, and last seen status that shows when you were last active on the platform.
