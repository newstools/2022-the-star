Malkia Strikers' trip to Brazil for High Performance Training as part of preparations for the World Championship hangs in the balance with the government remaining non-committal. The team is expected to leave for South America on June 18 for a two-month training camp but the government is yet to respond in regard to the team's budget, which was presented on April 27, according to Kenya Volleyball Federation vice chairman Charles Nyaberi. Nyaberi, however, remains optimistic that a consensus will be arrived at as KVF seeks funding for tickets, allowances for players, visas and Covid-19 related expenses. "We are making a passionate appeal to the government to help us raise air tickets and allowances. Our budget is Sh45.8m for the whole period," Nyaberi said. "FIVB are catering for accommodation, local transport, meals and salaries of the technical team. The government sponsored us for the qualifiers in Rwanda. It would be an anticlimax if we have gone through all that and fail to participate in the World Championships proper." On Tuesday, a 20- member provisional squad was named for the quadrennial show with Brazilian Luizomar de Moura named as head coach. The 19th edition of the World Championships will be jointly co-hosted by the Netherlands and Poland between September 23 and October 15. Kenya are in the Pool 'A' alongside continental rivals Cameroon, Belgium and Puerto Rico. Also in the pool of death are European champions Italy and the Netherlands.
