Reigning Enschede Marathon champion Maurine Chepkemoi is keeping her fingers crossed as she hopes to feature at next month's Commonwealth Games despite being named as a reserve athlete. The Kenyan road running specialist was named by Athletics Kenya as a reserve runner in the four-member women's marathon team ahead of the Commonwealth Games set for July 28 to August 8 in Birmingham, Britain. The shy athlete has promised to produce a superlative performance if not bag a medal in the event if given an opportunity. She said she is happy to be on the team even though she is a reserve. “This came as a surprise for me and I am happy to make the Kenyan team to the Commonwealth Games. As much as this will be my first time in Team Kenya, I hope to rise to the occasion given the chance,” said Chepkemei. Chepkemoi finished second at the Amsterdam Marathon last year in a time of 2:20:18, behind compatriot Angela Tanui. She said she suspects her time in Amsterdam inspired Athletics Kenyan to include her in the team. “I ran my personal best in Amsterdam and that must have informed my selection in the team. Irrespective of my role at the Commonwealth, I promise to repay this faith," she added. This year, the former Kisumu Marathon champion beat a star-studded field to win the Enschede Marathon title in 2:21:10 in April. “My dream is to come home with a medal one day. Here, I am on the reserve list and I can't say much. However, anything can happen but let us wait and see," she added. She also finished third at the 2019 Istanbul Marathon timed at 2:24:16 and posted similar results in Vienna City (2:26:16) the same year, behind compatriot Nancy Kiprop. Others in the Kenyan team are— Purity Changwony (2:22:16, Siena, 2021), Margaret Wangare (2:29:29, Los Angeles, 2020) and Stella Barsosio (2:22:08, Rotterdam, 2021).
