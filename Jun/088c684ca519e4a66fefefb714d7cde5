Our Constitution makes it mandatory that no one can be elected governor or president without a college degree. The degree can be obtained at a Kenyan college or abroad from a credible institution. But even with a clear and unequivocal condition, many aspiring and even politicians already holding office, degree certificates remain a challenge to a considerable number. And because we have a cutthroat approach to political competition, rivals get into overdrive to use the degree hurdle to block potential competition. Everyone nursing political ambition knows years in advance that they will be asked to provide their degree certificate as part of a list of conditions to be allowed to run for election. The decision by some politicians to hope that the IEBC will look the other way or they could somehow be exempt from the condition probably stems from our politicians' well-worn tendency for influence peddling. How else would a governor be unable to demonstrate that they have been tested and certified as a graduate of a specific college. The present rush to court to obtain orders to let some of them run for office is a waste of court time. The IEBC must never allow anyone regardless of status to skirt around the law. It must scrutinise with a fine toothcomb all papers lest the institution becomes a conduit for graft, which is on the verge of taking over our nation.
