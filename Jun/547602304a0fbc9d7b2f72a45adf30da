Police officers on Tuesday arrested two form three students from Njenga Karume Secondary school in Molo sub-county, after being found in possession of cannabis Sativa. Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti said the juveniles aged 16 and 17 were nabbed following a tip-off indicating that they had carried the prohibited drug to school. The 16-year-old believed to be the mastermind was arrested carrying four rolls, while his accomplice was arrested with a half-smoked joint intending to distribute it to other students. Kinoti said detectives in the town are on high alert after intelligence reports indicated that school-going teenagers have been recruited into a drug trafficking ring, led by a notorious suspect who has since gone into hiding. "A specialized team drawn from DCI’s Anti Narcotics unit will be conducting a major crackdown in the town aimed at flushing out the drug traffickers, who are targeting school children and using them as agents to traffic the prohibited weed," Kinoti said. Kinoti further said that marijuana is a prohibited drug and being found in possession, trafficking or growing the plant attracts heavy penalties of up to 20 years behind bars.
