Nyamira should be handed over to the national government, former KeNIA boss Reuben Marwanga says. He said the county has had a poor development record since devolution. The gubernatorial candidate who spoke in a phone interview on Tuesday said there is no need to have leaders who are stagnating the devolved unit. “We should have Nyamira handed back because despite the millions pumped by the national government, there's nothing down here,” Marwanga said. The former Kenya National Innovation Agency boss accused Governor Amos Nyaribo for failing to develop the county over the ten years, yet he wants a new term. “He has not helped much in ensuring there is development in the county. How will he establish development, if he never did it in the past years he has been in power,” he said. Marwanga seeks to unseat Nyaribo in the August general election on a Kanu ticket. The candidate has called upon residents to consider electing leaders who have vision and good will for the devolved unit. He said there are so many things that have not been done hence with change of leadership, some of the mistakes can be corrected. “Someone is in power and there are no drugs in hospitals, roads are impassable, ECDE teachers are crying, yet the government has given him the resources to do all these things. "And he still tells us to re-elect him. What new will he do, which he did not achieve before,” Marwanga noted. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
