Former head of county delivery unit John Mugwe has joined the Kiambu Senate race after he was cleared by IEBC to vie as an independent candidate. His clearance comes two months after he was edged out in the Jubilee nominations by George Maara. Mugwe unsuccessfully contested for governor in 2017 but later joined former governor Ferdinard Waititu. He was assigned the role of road executive but was later sacked by Waititu. Governor James Nyoro later brought him back as his advisor and head of the delivery unit. Mugwe exuded confidence that he will win the seat, saying he plans to begin fierce campaigns to convince the electorate to vote for him. “After I lost the ticket to my friend Maara, I had to take time and listen to my heart. I also consulted experts, friends and my family. I realised that I have the passion to serve residents of this county” he said. “I did not come back because I lost the Jubilee ticket; this is not a revenge mission. I’m here to seek votes since I want to serve the people. I know I have friends across the county who will support my strategies." Apart from Maara others seeking to succeed Kimani Wamatangi include  Machel Waikenda( Tujibebe) and Beth Wangui. Wamatangi is not defending his seat as he seeking the governor position on a UDA ticket. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
