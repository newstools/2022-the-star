Kisii Governor James Ongwae has assured Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga that he is working round the clock in ensuring he gets over 80 per cent of the votes in the region. Ongwae who is part of Raila's campaign team in Nyanza region said the Azimio candidate will get more votes from Kisii and Nyamira. He said Raila deserves to be the country's fifth president because of his fight for democracy. “The debate on who will be Kenya's fifth president has been concluded because people have since settled on Raila,” Ongwae told the Star on phone on Monday. The governor said Raila's manifesto is a clear indication that he will transform Kenya if he wins. He said Raila will support all sectors which contribute to the economy. Ongwae said leadership is about policies and agendas but not cheap propaganda. “Election is not only about the type of leader but it is about one who has the vision and agenda for the development of the nation,” he said. Ongwae welcomed all those seeking to succeed him saying they should convince voters of what they will do for them when given the chance. He urged competitors to engage in peaceful campaigns. Those seeking to succeed him are Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu, his Dagorreti North counterpart Simba Arati, Manson Oyongo and Senator Sam Ongeri. Ongwae however condemned an individual who he did not mention for organising goons to heckle other leaders during presidential campaigns in the region. “The era for hooliganism during campaigns has been passed by events,” he said. “All candidates should be accorded the opportunity to sell their policies free of interference.” Ongwae last week hosted Raila for the ground-breaking ceremony of Nyangweta Sugar Factory in South Mugirango. Raila promised that if elected, he will create a factory in all 47 counties.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
