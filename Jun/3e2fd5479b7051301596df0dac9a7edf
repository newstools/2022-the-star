ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru now says the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga currently enjoys the support of over 64 per cent of Kenyans. Mucheru cited the latest reports that he had accessed, saying they have put the ODM leader on top. He divulged that Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka have catapulted the opposition chief to a clear lead. "Many reports are showing the numbers continue to change and are in favour of Raila. Bringing in Martha and Kalonzo has seen these numbers increase. Now it is over 64 per cent,” he said. Mucheru was speaking in an interview on KTN News on Sunday. He used the platform to dismiss those chiding them for drumming up support for Raila. He argued that nothing bars Cabinet Secretaries from campaigning for their preferred candidates. He denied complaints from the Kenya Kwanza Alliance incriminating him of trying to influence the August 9 polls. Mucheru opined that the Deputy President William Ruto-led camp is angry at them because the DP has sensed defeat Ruto has already dismissed claims by CSs showing Raila is on the lead, saying they are created to influence perception. Ruto said the intelligence report he is privy to shows his camp is ahead. "I am the deputy president of Kenya. After the intelligence report is handed to the president, it comes to me," Ruto said. "In fact, our intelligence report that NIS has released is that Kenya Kwanza is ahead by 8 per cent against our competitor."
