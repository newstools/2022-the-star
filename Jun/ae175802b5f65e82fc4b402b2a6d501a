Deputy President William Ruto now claims the current economic model is to blame for the high level of poverty in the country. The DP said the current system has made it possible for only few people to get absurdly rich while condemning millions of ordinary Kenyans to poverty. He said his administration will change the economic model to give all Kenyans equal opportunity should he win the August 9 elections. “The model has entrenched poverty by making few people filthy rich while at the same time condemning millions to poverty,” Ruto said. He was speaking at Mukuru Kwa Njenga in Nairobi moments after being cleared to run for the country’s top seat by IEBC. The UDA presidential flagbearer drummed up support for Kenya Kwanza candidates telling residents to vote for only aspirants contesting on the coalition’s tickets. He was accompanied by his running mate Rigathi Gachagua, Kenya Kwanza co-principals Musalia Mudavadi, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi and Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. Others are Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and nominated Senator Millicent Omanga. Other than Mukuru, the DP addressed rallies at South B, City Stadium, Gikomba and Majengo. Ruto is later expected to address a major rally at the historic Kamukunji grounds.
