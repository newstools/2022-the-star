Gospel singer Daddy Owen has finally removed his cherished wedding ring. Owen has recently been spotted without it about one and half years after his split from wife Farida Wambui. Speaking to Word Is, Owen said it was time to remove it. Asked if it is a sign he has moved on, Owen said he would talk about it later. In an earlier interview, Owen said he kept his ring since he was not shy from challenges or issues. "I'm like a bull, I'll face it head-on. The truth is like a lion, once it's out, it's out, and I'm ready to fight in the jungle." In October last year, South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro asked singer Daddy Owen to look for another woman. This was during his 'Chapter IV' album launch.
