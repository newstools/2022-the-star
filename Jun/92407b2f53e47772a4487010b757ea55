Agriculture CS Peter Munya has told off Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi for opposing the new miraa regulations. He said the regulations are meant to benefit miraa farmers. Speaking on Thursday in Ruiri, Meru, he said Kiraitu should instead put aside the market levies for miraa farmers. The CS said Kiraitu should not provoke him if he has failed to deliver on his developmental agenda. "When he wakes up in the morning, he launches an attack on Munya. In the evening, he attacks Munya," he said. Munya said he is not contesting for Meru governor as he is concentrating on national politics. "I am looking votes for Raila Odinga but if Kiraitu rattles me, he will surely get what he is asking for," he said. The CS said he is shocked as to why Kiraitu is attacking him, yet they are both in the Azimio coalition and campaigning for Raila. "Kiraitu should concentrate on the likes of Kawira Mwangaza and Mithika Linturi, his rivals," he said. Kiraitu had on Monday opposed the new regulations saying he was not consulted. "We know that agriculture is devolved, they should have consulted me before they put up the regulations," he said. The governor said the regulations will do more harm than good to miraa farmers and traders. He said the many licences required in the miraa sector will cut farmers' profits and, hence, are unacceptable. "If you have a miraa nursery you must have a licence. To grow miraa, you must have a licence. To sell miraa, you must be licenced as a trader. To export miraa you must also be licenced as an exporter," Kiraitu said. The county boss threatened to seek court arbitration in opposing the regulations. Munya however said no money will be required for farmers to get licences. "Kiraitu is saying I have written bad regulations and he was not consulted. As Meru governor, he should draft his own regulations. "He has been governor for almost five years, what has he done to assist miraa farmers?" he asked. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
