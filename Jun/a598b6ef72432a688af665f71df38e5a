The Commission for University Education has revoked recognition of Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja's degree from Team University in Uganda. A letter from the Commission dated June 14, 2022, says it has received material information about the authenticity of the Bachelor of Science in Management degree. The commission says the degree will further be investigated to ascertain its validity. “Consequently, in accordance with the CUE recognition procedures, we hereby revoke the recognition of your degree from the aforementioned university,” CUE chairman Chacha Nyaigoti Chacha said. The commission had on June 6 written to the senator confirming the recognition of the certificate. The credibility of Sakaja's degree from the Team University has been brought to question by four people who claim it was forged. The matter came up soon after Sakaja was cleared by the IEBC on June 7 to contest for the Nairobi governor seat on a UDA ticket. One of the complainants, Dennis Wahome, claims in an affidavit to IEBC that Sakaja never studied or graduated from the Team University. He claimed that Sakaja's Bachelor of Science in Management degree from Team University was printed on May 29, 2022. Wahome further said Sakaja never graduated from the University on October 21, 2016, as he claimed since his name is not on the university's graduation list. In fact, he claimed, Team University scrapped the Bachelor of Science in Management degree course in 2015, a year before Sakaja's alleged graduation. The Senator has, however, maintained that his academic credentials are valid. The matter is before the IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee whose verdict is expected anytime.
