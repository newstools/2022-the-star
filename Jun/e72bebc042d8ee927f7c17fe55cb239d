Reigning Paris Marathon champion Judith Jeptum Korir believes a podium sweep is possible for Kenya considering the calibre of runners named to represent the country at next month's World Championships in Oregon. Jeptum said their target is to replicate the 2011 performance in Daegu, South Korea, where Edna Kiplagat led Priscah Jeptoo and Sharon Cherop to the top three places. Jeptum, who trains in Kapsait in Elgeyo Marakwet county under coach Erick Kimaiyo has, however,  predicted a tough race. “This is my first time in Team Kenya and I know it won't be easy despite having a very strong company. However, we would like to run as a team and collect all medals on offer,” said Jeptum, who is also the reigning Abu Dhabi Marathon champion. She believes her selection was mainly based on her consistency in various marathons across the world. “The team is fine because we have the best runners like Peres Jepchirchir, Ruth Chepngetich and Angela Tanui. Personally, I  have also been improving with every race and I believe I am up to the challenge,” she said. She said the decision by Athletics Kenya (AK) to allow them to train in their familiar grounds is the best as a change of environments is likely to affect some of them. Jeptum noted: “Being in Team Kenya means a lot for me as an athlete and I hope to reciprocate the good gesture by winning a medal,” said Korir. The World Championships will be her 5th marathon following her triumph in Paris Marathon and Abu Dhabi and second place in Eldoret City Marathon. “Considering I will be running for Team Kenya for the first time, I know I am bound to face some challenges but I am ready," she added.
