Kenya Kwanza Alliance presidential running mate Rigathi Gachagua has told off his critics saying he has no time to waste on trading barbs with them. Speaking during a Kirinyaga County Economic Forum on Tuesday, he is focused on delivering the task bestowed on him by Deputy President William Ruto. "I am a man on a mission. Nimepewa kazi na William Ruto ya kupanga uchumi. Nikona kazi ya kutafuta kura," he said. This loosely translates to, "I am a man on a mission. I have been assigned the duty of planning the economy by Ruto. I have a duty to look for votes". The Mathira MP said the team has no time to rest as their work schedule is fully packed. " From here in Kirinyaga we will be heading to Laikipia. From there, we will go to Samburu. We have no time to engage anybody. We are focused and we know will do good for this country," he reiterated. "Our eye is on the goal. We cannot be distracted because we know what we need to do." This comes even after a section of Kenya Kwanza leaders accused him of being the cause of division in the outfit. Tujibebe Wakenya party leader William Kabogo and CCK leader Moses Kuria last week accused Gachagua of being the cause of the rift after showing open bias for UDA candidates. Kuria, however, exonerated Gachagua from any blame saying it is the UDA party to blame. Kabogo on the other hand fingered Gachagua saying he is the root cause of the diplomatic tiff. "Before Gachagua was picked as Ruto's running mate, I opposed. It is after he was picked that our relationship with UDA deteriorated," Kabogo said while addressing his electorates at Thika on Thursday. "It is because that man is a dictator. My problem is talking the truth because I told Ruto Gachagua will cost him votes."
