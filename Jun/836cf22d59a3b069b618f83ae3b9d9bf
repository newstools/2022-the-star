Kisumu Central MP Fred Ouda was on Saturday attacked by an angry mob at Kirembe Grounds where Governor Anyang' Nyong'o was holding a campaign rally. The area MP was whisked away in a police Land Cruiser as police lobbed tear gas canisters at the youth. Ouda, including other leaders, led governor Anyang Nyong'o, Deputy Governor Mathews Owili, Murang'a Women Rep Sabina Chege, Kisumu Women Rep Rosa Buyu, amongst other MPs, MCAs and ODM nominees for the various posts were from Otonglo market where Nyong'o officially opened the market. The chaos started when Ouda tried to make his way to the main dias, when he was attacked by the youths. His clothes were torn during the fracas. The youths ran after the police car ferrying the MP, saying they will not allow him to access the venue. "We will not allow him to access the dias to address us," the youths shouted. Ouda attended the event following an invitation from Governor Anyang' Nyongo's campaign secretariat in a letter dated June 3. "Prof. Peter Anyang’ Nyong’o will launch his gubernatorial re-election campaign on June 4, 2022, at Kirembe grounds near Otonglo market. This will be preceded by the presentation of the nomination papers to the County IEBC Election Manager at Tom Mboya Labor College from 9.00 a.m. The Governor, therefore, invites you to join him for this auspicious occasion," read the invite. His supporters criticised his ejection from the rally, saying the MP only honoured the invite. "If we knew this is what was going to happen, we could have not attended the event," one supporter said.
