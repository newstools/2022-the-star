The annual Maseno School Amadi Open tournament resumes on July 23 and 24 after a two-year break. The 27th edition of the tournament has already attracted more than 50 teams, according to Maseno School’s sports director, Caleb Olang’o. The tournament took a two-year break due to the suspension of sports activities following the Covid-19 outbreak. Next year, the tournament will be held in February when the school games calendar resumes. “This tournament normally attracts all national secondary schools champions and this year’s event will not be different. Already, some of the current and former national and East Africa champions have confirmed their participation,” Olang’o said. Some of the top teams already included are hosts Maseno, Kakamega High School, St Mary’s Yala, Dagoretti High, Lenana School, Koyonzo, Kisii county giants Nduru Boys, Kisumu Day, St. Peter’s Mumias and Kabianga High School. “We expect a highly competitive tournament since every team will field their strongest teams without fear of spying scouts,” he noted. He said Maseno School will hope to assert their authority in rugby, hockey, handball, and basketball. “During the St Mary’s Yala tournament, we won the handball title while in basketball, we lost to USIU in the finals. In rugby, we once again lost to USIU  in the semis. This time, we want to go for the titles,” said Olang’o. Teams will pay a registration fee of Sh2,000 while those teams requiring accommodation will pay Sh300 per student. The tournament will feature table tennis, lawn tennis, badminton, handball, soccer, hockey, volleyball and basketball for boys and girls. Teams will also take part in rugby 7’s and 15’s. The tournament is sponsored by Maseno School, CIC Insurance and Hechlink Ventures. “We have also written to corporates like Equity Bank and Equator Bottlers requesting sponsorship,” added Olang’o.
