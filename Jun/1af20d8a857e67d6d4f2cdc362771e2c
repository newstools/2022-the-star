Vihiga senator George Khaniri has been endorsed by the Tiriki Council of Elders for the governor seat. In the Saturday event, the elders said it was time for the Tiriki to clinch the seat after the incumbent Wilber Ottichilo, who hails from Bunyore and the former Moses Akaranga who hails from Maragoli. However, Khaniri will also have to face off against  Akaranga, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi and former county secretary Francis Ominde who are also eyeing the seat. Agoi who is vying on an ANC ticket has already picked Joyce Mmaitsi as his running mate. Mmaitsi hails from Khaniri’s backyard. Akaranga has picked Paul Mbuni, who hails from the Tiriki community as his running mate. Ominde, who hails from Maragoli picked Wycliffe Chabeya from the Tiriki community as his running mate. Ottichilo and Khaniri have picked their running mates from the Maragoli community. Khaniri has picked Jerald Samoya and Ottichilo picked former Lugaga wa Muluma ward rep Wilberforce Kitiezo. Khaniri is banking on the Tiriki community which has about 80 per cent of the votes. “I have consulted my people and they have given me the mandate to go for that seat,” Khaniri said. “I am urging my brother Agoi and our senior Akaranga to rally behind me and I will send Ottichilo home, but if we all contest, we might not make it." Ottichilo termed the three opponents as fl​​ower girls who can’t give him sleepless nights. “Politics is not just making noise in funerals or churches and on-road shows, politics is a game of numbers and that’s all,” Ottichilo said. "I have heard some people say they will send me home, so I wonder who told them that I don't know the way to my home," Ottichilo said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
