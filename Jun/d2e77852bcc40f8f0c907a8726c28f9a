Bomet is the fifth county to launch a spatial plan to guide sustainable development and ensure environmental protection for current and future generations. Governor Hillary Barchok said the launch of Bomet County Spatial Plan could not have come at an opportune time as policymakers are seeking easier and efficient avenues to formulate sector policies and plans. "Implementers of the plan will be able to align their programmes and projects with the national aspirations in Kenya Vision 2030, National Land Policy and government development programmes,” Governor Barchok said during the launch at the county headquarters on Saturday. The county boss said the 10-year Bomet plan was developed in a participatory and transparent manner, with input of multiple stakeholders, including the public. The county spent Sh48 million in developing the plan. Its main purpose is to transform Bomet into a balanced agro-based economy. The other counties that have launched spatial plans to guide spatial planning  are Lamu, Kericho, Tharaka Nithi and  Kajiado among others. Conservation organization WWF-Kenya provided technical and financial support through the mobilisation of people for public participation and the establishment of a GIS laboratory in the county. “As Bomet county commits to implement this 10-year spatial plan, WWF-Kenya commits to offer the necessary support and advice to the county to help the realisation of this ambitious plan, for the benefit of the people through the improvement of their quality of life and for conservation of nature,” WWF-Kenya Head of Conservation Programmes Jackson Kiplagat said. The National Land Commission, the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning and Bomet-based universities also provided technical assistance to facilitate development of the plan. NLC commissioner Esther Murugi said the review of the plan will be done after 10 years and urged all residents and leadership to support it.
