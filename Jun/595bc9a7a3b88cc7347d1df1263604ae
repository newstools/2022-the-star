The Azad Maidan police on Wednesday arrested a 50-year-old Kenyan for allegedly attacking eight pedestrians at Parsi Bawdi near Bombay High Court with a knife. The accused has been identified as John Menty. Police said the eight injured persons are out of danger. The attacker, who also sustained injuries to his hand, has been admitted to JJ Hospital. Four of the injured were taken to JJ Hospital while the remaining four were admitted to GT Hospital. “Only one person out of the eight has sustained serious injuries to his neck. The rest will be discharged,” an officer said. According to police officials, the incident took place at around 4.15pm. Police are trying to ascertain whether Menty was under the influence of drugs or alcohol as he became violent after a verbal altercation with his female friend. “He attacked eight people and subsequently the locals present there informed the police control room, after which a team went to the spot to take control of the situation,” an officer said. Menty allegedly even tried to attack the police, but officers managed to overpower him and took him to the police station. Edited by A.N
