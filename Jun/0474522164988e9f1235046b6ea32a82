Interior PS Karanja Kibicho on Tuesday, May 31, said images of Deputy President William Ruto's rallies are manipulated to create a perception that he has a huge fanatical following. The Interior PS cited a case example of DP's Kirinyaga rally where he claimed the images were 'photoshopped' to show a massive turnout. "I saw a photo of my town Kagio that has one road that three vehicles cannot pass side-by-side. But their images showed their rally had a crowd of about 2 kilometres wide on the same road," Kibicho said in an interview with Citizen TV. "That is perception creation that is very far from facts." Fact-checker has, however, assessed the images and established that they are not photoshopped as claimed by PS Kibicho. A search of the image using Google lens takes you back to Ruto's social media handles where they were first shared showing the images are authentic and have not been sourced from anywhere else. Like many other images the DP shares on his handles, photos of the Kirinyaga rally were shot using a wide-angle lens and at an elevated point. In such a case, it is wrong to say such images are photoshopped or manipulated since the cameraperson deployed his or her skills to get a photo that suits their interests.
