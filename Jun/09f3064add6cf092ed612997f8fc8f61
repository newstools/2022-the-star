Fresh from winning a silver medal in the 5,000m at the just concluded Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Reduit, Mauritius, Daniel Simiu Ebenyo is keen to book a slot for either World Championships or the Commonwealth Games. With the Athletics national trials set for Friday and Saturday at the Kasarani stadium, Ebenyo, who won silver at the Africa championships in 5,000m, will be chasing for a slot to Oregon and Birmingham. The Berlin 10km champion will be hoping to write off the memories of 2019 when he missed a ticket to the World Championships in Doha, Qatar after failing to comply with anti-doping rules alongside his counterpart Michael Kibet. The reigning Cape Town 12km road race champion said his priority is the  World Championships but will be good to head to Birmingham if he misses the slot. “It was my first medal for this country and that has motivated me to win a medal on the world stage. But first things first and I will have to focus on this week's trials before plotting for the global event,” he said. Ebenyo finished second at the recent Africa Senior Athletics Championships behind Ethiopian Hailemariyam Tegegn. "My training is going on well and a slot for World Championships will be the most appreciated," he noted. He said his target is not only to improve his 5,000m performance but also to win medals. The reigning Valencia Ibercaja 10km champion won the silver medal in 13:38.79 and will be facing off with other athletes like Olympians Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli, and Jacob Krop among others. “Making my debut in the race will be great and my preparations are currently top-notch,” said Ebenyo, the inaugural Nakuru City Half Marathon champion. He is also the winner of the Corrida de Houilles 10km race as well as the Family Bank Half Marathon.
