Former half marathon world record holder Kibiwott Kandie wants to end Kenya's 20-year title drought by bagging gold in the men's 10,000m in the Commonwealth Games slated for Birmingham. The quadrennial showpiece is scheduled for July 28 to August 8. Kenya last won a gold medal in the men's 10,000m during the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester through Wilberforce Talel. "I am optimistic about returning home with a gold medal. I have invested my time in training and I believe my dedication will pay off," Kandie said. Kandie posted 27:33:57 to with the race during the trials over the weekend, earning himself a direct ticket to the Commonwealth Games and World Championships. However, he will only compete in Birmingham, unlike other runners who will also feature in the World Championships in Oregon. Despite his knee injury which has been a nightmare for him since last year, Kandie has proven to be formidable both in the 25-lap race and on the roads. Kandie said he is unperturbed by the threat that has recently been posed by neighbouring Uganda and Ethiopia among other countries. He said he believes with teamwork, the gold medal will come back to Kenya. "I am optimistic that with teamwork and self-belief, we will definitely bring the medal back home," he said. Kandie edged out 2018 World Under-20 5,000m silver medalist Waithaka Mburu to second place in 27:34:01. Mburu is optimistic that the team is strong and in good shape to take on the competition. "I have observed that the team is fit to take on the race and perform well. As a team, we have to come up with tactics to help us improve...individual effort is also essential so that we can represent the country well," he said. Mburu will represent Kenya in the World Championships alongside Daniel Mateiko and Rodgers Kwemoi while Kandie will be accompanied by Edward Zakayo and Daniel Simiu.
