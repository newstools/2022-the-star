Deputy President William Ruto has for the first time opened up on why he settled on Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate in the August 9, polls. The DP said his choice of Gachagua is because of his passion for the people and ability to connect with ordinary people. He said Gachagua has the people's interests at heart and that is why he believed he was the best person to be his deputy. "He (Gachagua) is a passionate leader. He is a people's person. He speaks about things I speak about. He speaks about ordinary Kenyans. The nexus between me and Gachagua is the people," the DP said in an interview with NTV on Sunday. At the same time, the DP confirmed that even though Tharaka Nithi won on several aspects that were being considered in choosing his running mate, he opted for Gachagua. He said the decision to pick Gachagua was made by him in consultation with members of his Kenya Kwanza Alliance team. "There were many other instruments I was using to pick my running mate. I looked at very many things that were required of a running mate. We all settled as a team on Gachagua as a running mate," he added. Gachagua in an interview with Inooro TV on My 15 said the DP settled on him because he is a skilled mobilised who would easily connect with the people of Mt Kenya region, remarks the DP also agreed with. "He (Gachagua) is an accomplished public servant. Is a self-made person. What I like more about him is the passion for the people," he stated.
