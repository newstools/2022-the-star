AFC Leopards are hoping their victory against Homeboys last weekend will act as a morale booster for them in Wednesday’s Exhibition match against Gor Mahia during the Madaraka day celebrations. Leopards head coach Patrick Aussems said he is optimistic of good results against Gor Mahia. This, he said will serve as a precursor for Kenya Premier League matches against Nairobi City Stars on Saturday and Nzoia Sugar on June 11 to wrap up the league. He said despite their current position, their dream to finish in the top five or four is still very much alive. “The game against Gor Mahia is very special for us because it will act as a build-up for our last two Premier League matches against Nairobi City Stars (Saturday) and Nzoia FC (June 11),” said Aussems. He added: “As you all know, we are targeting the top five or four in the league and we are trying to pile pressure on our opponents and it is paying dividends.” Against Homeboyz, he said they capitalised on their opponents' complacency to win the match.
