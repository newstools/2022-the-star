Kenya men’s team have been drawn in Pool D alongside Wales, Poland, China and Chinese Taipei for the 2022 World Lacrosse Championships scheduled for August 10-20th in Limerick, Ireland. However, the trip hangs in balance owing to financial hiccups. With a month to the event, the Kenya team is still looking for funds to purchase tickets for the tour. According to the information posted on the Kenya Lacrosse Instagram page, the team has managed to secure 17 passports for their players and they are waiting for four more. If the trip materializes, the team will be the first junior men’s team from Africa to feature in the prestigious event. However, the women’s national team was the first to feature at the World Lacrosse Women’s Championship in 2019 in Canada. "We have finally managed to secure passports for our players to travel to Ireland for the global show, days after appealing for financial aid. However, we still need help to raise tickets for the team,” said the statement in part. Kenya needs a total of US$60,000 and Africa Lacrosse Foundation is working to raise the amount to cater for both food and accommodation for the players during the 12 days' stay in Ireland. So far US$34,634 has been raised for the project.
