ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday clashed over comments made on Mitumba business. Raila, who launched his manifesto on Tuesday, is accused to have made remarks that have been misconstrued to mean he meant he will ban Mitumba business. The comments formed part of the major discussion on social media with supporters of the DP accusing Raila of saying he will ban the business completely. Weighing on the debate, the DP took to Twitter to disparage the ODM leader over his comment. "Trickle-down is dangerous. They branded business people's merchandise counterfeit & destroyed them. Now clothing enterprises are dealers in dead people's wares to be banned. BOTTOM-UP, using TVET will assist these enterprises to grow from sewing, cottage to textile & leather industry." The comment did not last long before the ODM leader fired back saying: "Ambieni wale majamaa, the internet never forgets". Raila's response was a caption to a video of Ruto making similar remarks to that he made about the business. Ruto, on a day yet to be established, was recorded saying his government will boost local manufacturing and stop the importation of clothes and shoes into the country.
