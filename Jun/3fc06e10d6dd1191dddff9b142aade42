A man on Wednesday caused drama during the meeting between presidential candidates and IEBC on voter preparedness. The man identified as Julius Kamau approached the electoral agency chair Wafula Chebukati with a banner and made some demands just as Chebukati was about to invite the candidates to voice their concerns. "What I want is freedom," Kamau shouted as orderlies carried him shoulder high out of the room. It was not clear on what issue he wanted freedom on. The IEBC is currently receiving concerns from the presidential candidates touching on the electoral processes at Windsor hotel, Nairobi. The bone of contention from all the candidates is the availability of a complementary system of identification of voters. Save for UDA's William Ruto who is absent at the meeting, Azimio's Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua, Roots Party leader George Wajackoyah and Agano's David Mwaure Waihiga are present. Ruto was represented by Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok and UDA secretary general Veronica Maina. The meeting arose from the commission's intentions not to use the manual voter register to identify voters on election day in the event that Kiems kits fail. The agency said it prefers the exclusive use of the electronic voter identification because the alphanumeric system can track voters and prevent double voting. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission further argued that hard copy voter register is prone to manipulation.
