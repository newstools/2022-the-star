Former Kakamega senator Boni Khalwale was a man under siege in Matungu area, Kakamega county. A chaotic incident erupted that saw his vehicle pelted with stones as he raced against time to save his dear life. Trouble began after the senator failed to endorse Senator Cleophas Malala for the governor seat despite both of them being in the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The Former senator urged residents to weigh all leaders from the area and elect whoever they want for any seat. He, however, campaigned for himself saying he is the best legislator known across the country. "All of us are seeking seats. Weigh us and pick whoever you want for any seat. Choose one who will care for you. Remember Khalwale is the best legislator in Kenya. " The remarks rattled Malala who took on him head-on saying he is "confused". It is after the confrontation that Khalwale was forced out of the rally seemingly by angry Malala's supporters. "Go away from here. Disappear," the senator was ordered by rowdy youths in a video seen by the Star. As his security details cleared the way, the agitated group trailed his car telling him to hasten. Things turned for the worse after the group started throwing stones at his convoy. The senator eventually managed to leave the chaotic scene as the youths continued to hurl stones at his vehicle. After he vacated the scene, the youths were heard chanting: "We want Lishenga! We want lishenga!" Lishenga is the ODM candidate for the Kakamega senate seat.
