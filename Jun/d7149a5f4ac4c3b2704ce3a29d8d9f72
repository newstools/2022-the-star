The government has been urged to speed up internet connection to support e-learning. The director of Neb College of Science and Technology in Garissa Prof Abdi Maalim said many activities are being digitised globally and Kenya should not lag behind. Maalim spoke at the Third Capacity Building and Midwifery Leadership in Africa conference held at St Paul's University in Limuru subcounty on Friday. The chief guest of the conference was Prof Michelle Frankich from the University of Tampa in the USA. Frankich urged the government to ensure all students throughout the country access internet to promote e-learning. Maalim said the lack of internet connectivity in many parts of the country exposes learners to inequality. The scholar applauded the government for the efforts it was making to ensure it connects many people with high-speed internet. However, Maalim proposed that the connectivity should be hastened in libraries, technical institutes and government offices. “Schools need to be connected with the internet. Today a lot of work is done using the internet. Lessons, research, marketing and trading is done using the internet” he said. “Our county and national governments should look at that. The mode of communication is the internet and it is not waiting for us, let us move with it." Kathoni Mungai, a nursing student at the varsity said they managed to proceed with their syllabus at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic because of the internet connectivity. “When Covid-19 cases were reported institutions were ordered to be close but we switched to e-learning and continued with our studies,” she said.
