Tunisia international Wahbi Khazri has joined French Ligue 1 side Montpellier on a free transfer from relegated Saint-Etienne. The 31-year-old forward scored 37 goals in 114 appearances for the club after joining from Sunderland in 2018. However, he could not help Saint-Etienne extend their 18-year stay in the top flight as they were beaten in a play-off by Auxerre on penalties. Khazri has won 68 caps for Tunisia and captained the side at the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, but he missed the 2022 World Cup play-off win over Mali in March because of injury. “It’s a new challenge,” he told the Montpellier website. “I think I needed it and now I look to help the club grow, achieve its goals and give my best.” Khazri has previously had spells in France with Bastia, Bordeaux and Rennes. Meanwhile, former Manchester City captain Fernandinho has re-signed for Brazilian side Athletico Paranaense, the club where he started his career. The 37-year-old former Brazil player said he had offers from several clubs but was “fulfilling a personal wish to wear the Athletico shirt again”. Fernandinho left City at the end of the 2021-22 season after nine years. The five-time Premier League winner returns to Athletico 17 years after leaving them for Shakhtar Donetsk. Athletico are managed by former Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari. “We had numerous proposals, from several different clubs, from Brazil and abroad,” said Fernandinho. “But the most sensible decision was to return home and try to deliver my best here at Athletico now. “Establish a brand that will end my career playing for just three clubs: two in Europe and one in Brazil. I’m very happy, I thank my family, which has always supported me in this decision. “Not only my heart, but all of us ended up speaking louder at that moment.”
