Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka will on Thursday reunite with ODM leader Raila Odinga barely a month after he announced that he had decamped from the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance. Raila Odinga Press Secretary Dennis Onsarigo said the Wiper leader will announce his comeback to Azimio during a joint rally at Mkuru Kwa Njenga in Nairobi. The development comes just a day after Kalonzo announced that he would make a major political announcement in two days' time. Speaking at the burial of former diplomat Joseph Katithi in Kyawango village in Mwala, Machakos, Kalonzo hinted that he could be on his way back to the coalition, casting speculations that he had abandoned his ambitions to run for the presidency. While making the announcement, he urged the Kamba community to bear with him and support his political move, stating that it was in their best interest. "I will give a political statement within two days’ time. That’s why I am requesting the Kamba community to support my political move,” Kalonzo said. He asked the region's leaders not to ridicule him once he makes the announcement since he has the blessings of the Wiper party’s delegates. The delegates last week urged Kalonzo to rejoin Azimio and renegotiate on behalf of the community what is at stake for them as a region. They urged him to abandon his plan to run for the presidency for the sake of his community. The Wiper leader had announced his intention to vie for president two weeks ago after Raila named Martha Karua his running mate. He had said he would run for the presidency on the Wiper ticket under the One Kenya Alliance coalition after he felt shortchanged in the Azimio. "If there is no faith, you can't do business... For how long will we sacrifice and even of we sacrifice, they mess up," he said. But a week after his announcement, his allies held an emergency meeting to chart a way forward. They voted overwhelmingly (45 to five) against Musyoka’s departure from the Raila-led coalition.
