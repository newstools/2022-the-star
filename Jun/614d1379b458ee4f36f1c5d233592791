Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance Presidential candidate Raila Odinga now says Deputy President William Ruto is setting the stage for rejecting the presidential results of the forthcoming elections. In a letter to IEBC and DPP with regards to Ruto's UDA seeking the prosecution of five Cabinet secretaries and a principal secretary, Raila said the Kenya Kwanza team has sensed defeat. UDA had written to the two institutions seeking the prosecution of the five CSs and the PS for involvement in politics. The five CSs mentioned by UDA were Fred Matiang'i (Interior), Joe Mucheru (ICT), Eugene Wamalwa (Defence), James Macharia (Transport), Keriako Tobiko (Environment) and Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho. "The continued participation of CSs and PSs in the political activities of the Azimio coalition is brazenly contrary to section 16 of the public officer and ethics Act, 2003 read with section 23 of the Leadership and Integrity Act, 2012," UDA secretary General Veronica Maina's letter read in part. Through his lawyer Paul Mwangi, Raila has, however, asked IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati and DPP Noordin Haji to trash the demands. The ODM leader said the issue of CSs participating in partisan politics was settled with finality in 2017 by the Supreme Court of Kenya. Raila said the claims raised by Ruto through the UDA secretary- are just but a ground for rejecting the August elections. "The legal position being advanced by UDA is therefore duplicitous...it is intended to establish grounds for UDA's legal challenge at the Supreme Court of the imminent Raila Odinga victory in the Presidential election of August 9, 2022," Mwangi said in a letter seen by the Star on Saturday.
