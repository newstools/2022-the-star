Marinating adds flavour and creates the best steak ever. To avoid getting a chewy steak, include lemon juice in your marinade to help soften the steak. It also breaks down the tough fibers in the meat. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, seasoning, pepper, salt, and a pinch of pepper. Step 2 Add steaks to a resealable zip lock bag or large bowl and pour the marinade on top. Marinate for 2 hours or overnight. Step 3 To cook the steak, add butter to your pan, and then add the steaks. Cook on each side for 3 minutes or until the outside is browned. Reduce heat to medium-high. Serve with roasted potatoes, vegetables, or rice, and enjoy.
