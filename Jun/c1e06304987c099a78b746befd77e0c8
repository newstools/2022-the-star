Azimo deputy presidential candidate Martha Karua is visiting Eldoret for a church service and a series of campaign meetings. It's the first time Karua is visiting the region after she was appointed as running mate to presidential candidate Raila Odinga. The region is Deputy President William Ruto's home county and a perceived stronghold but Azimo enjoys support mostly within Eldoret. Karua, accompanied by other Azimio leaders, is attending a church service at PCEA church in Eldoret before holding closed-door meetings to plan campaigns. She will then have a roadside meeting at the main market in Eldoret before the main rally at Huruma grounds. She is with Azimio leaders including Elgeyo Marakwet governor Alex Tolgos, Dr Mukhisa Kituyi and Kipkorir Menjo among others.
