Kenya earned its fourth gold at the ongoing Senior Africa Athletics Championships in Reduit, Mauritius after clinching the men's 4x100m. The Kenyan quartet of newly-crowned Africa 100m champion Ferdinand Omanyala, Dan Kiviasi, Samwel Imeta and Mike Mokamba timed 39.28 as South Africa (39.79 ) and Zimbabwe (39.81) finished second and third respectively. Omanyala was over the moon, tipping his hat off to his teammates for their dogged determination to fly the national flag high at the Cote D' Or National Sports Complex. "Things are changing now. The world should get used to seeing more sprinters from Kenya. Now we have a strong relay team and soon we will be on the world stage," Omanyala said. The gold was the perfect icing on the cake for Team Kenya who also bagged a silver and two bronze on Day Three of the continental showpiece. Nicholas Kiplagat timed 1:46.43 to clinch silver in the men's 800m as Algeria Slimane Moula ran away with gold in 1:45.59. Botswana's Tshepiso Maselela finished third in 1:46.65 Geoffrey Kirwa finished third in the men's 3000m steeplechase, timing 8:29.74, behind the Ethiopian pair of Amare Hailemariyam (8:27.38) and Takele Tadese (8:28.31) in first and second respectively. In the women's 400m, Veronicah Mutua bagged another bronze, timing 52.76 in third.
