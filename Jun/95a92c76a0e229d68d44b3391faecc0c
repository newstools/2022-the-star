The electoral commission is left with less than 100 complaints filed by complainants relating to the nomination and clearance of aspirants for the August 9 polls. The Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission  (DRC) said on Saturday the Dispute Resolution Committee has so far dispensed of over 160 cases out the 262 that were filed. "As of Friday, 17th June, 2022 at 11pm, the DRC had delivered 163 judgments out of the 262 complaints that were filed," the commission said in a tweet. The tribunal sittings entered the eight day Saturday at the Milimani Law Courts. The number of the cases resolved so far is expected to rise after Saturday's hearings. Among the verdicts expected on Saturday is on the legality of the degree certificate of the Machakos Wiper governor candidate Wavinya Ndeti. Ndeti is under fire over the legality of her Computer Science Degree from London South Bank University. The former CAS shared a letter on social media reportedly from the university confirming she was a student. The letter indicated she undertook the computer degree course over a span of only ten months, between September 1994 to July 1995. The DRC has been holding sittings until late in the night in a bid to resolve all filed complaints with just 51 days to the polls. On Sunday, the tribunal is expected to deliver its verdict on the authenticity of Nairobi governor seat aspirant Johnson Sakaja's degree. Sakaja's Bachelor of Science in Management degree from Uganda's Team University is under scrutiny over alleged forgery. On Saturday, the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai asked the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to probe the two and estalish the truth.
