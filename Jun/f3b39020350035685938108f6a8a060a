Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday arrived late for the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission meeting with presidential candidates. Ruto explained that it was not intentional for him to arrive late, saying earlier communication indicated the meeting was to start at 11 am. Ruto said his Secretary-General, Veronica Maina, informed him late that there was a change of time for the meeting. He said he had already scheduled time for other meetings in the morning hours hence his lateness. "I would request maybe in future, give us three to four days notice to give us ample time for preparation as you understand Mr. chairman, every minute counts," Ruto said. Ruto had earlier pitched a tent in Tharaka Nithi where he held a county economic forum meeting. Ruto was accompanied by Tharaka Nithi Senator and United Democratic Alliance chief agent Kithure Kindiki. Before Ruto's arrival, he was represented by Turkana governor Josphat Nanok and his party SG. Nanok had explained that Ruto missed the start of the IEBC meeting because of confusion in the schedule issued by IEBC. "I am the chief agent for UDA Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate who is not here with us with his running mate because of a schedule you had done earlier," Nanok said. "Your letter yesterday changed the timing from afternoon to morning and was received by us very late and we even wrote to you to reschedule the time and I think in the absence of a response from you we were forced to come and represent. But he may catch us later." Chebukati, however, denied changing the meeting time and said the communicated time remained the same, at 9 am. "There was no afternoon session, the letter of invitation talked of 9 am so there was no afternoon session," Chebukati said.
