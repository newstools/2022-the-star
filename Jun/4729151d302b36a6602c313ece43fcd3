Deputy President William Ruto has come under sharp criticism over his two-thirds gender rule programme. Speaking in Watamu, Kilifi Azimio leaders said his failure to appoint a woman as running mate speaks volumes about his commitment to accommodate women. The leaders, led ODM Kilifi gubernatorial candidate Gideon Mungaro, said Ruto was insincere. "If he says that he will implement the gender rule in his administration yet he did not bother to go for a woman as running mate, that is a sign of a leader who cares less about women," Mung'aro said. "If you look at our Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, he went for a woman running mate, opening the gates for more women empowerment in his future government." Mung'aro added that he himself decided to implement the same by picking Flora Chibule as his running mate in implementing the gender rule. Kilifi Senator Stewart Madzayo also poked holes into Ruto' s two-thirds gender rule commtiment, saying he was misleading Kenyans. "How do you say that you can implement two-third gender rule while in real terms you are filling your top appointments with men instead of women. That is daylight lie," he said. Kilifi youth Azimio leader Fikirini Jacobs said the DP was lying to Kenyans that he will implement the two-thirds gender rule while in reality, he is doing the opposite. He said the only leader people can bank on is Raila Odinga who has shown his love and care for women in this country. Jacobs said Ruto failed to rally his lieutenants to back the two-third Gender Bill when it was taken to Parliament. “His number one supporter is Aden Duale who was the number one leader to reject the Bill. The DP [then] went ahead and picked Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate," Jacobs said.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
