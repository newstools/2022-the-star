A case seeking to bar Dagoreti North MP Simba Arati from contesting for Kisii gubernatorial seat has been dismissed. Arati was handed the reprieve after the complainants withdrew the matter on grounds they had based their arguments on a lie. Lawyer Peter Wanyama who appeared for the two complainants-Moses Ayieko and Wesley Obwang'i-said they have since obtained evidence confirming that Arati possesses a degree certificate from Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University and hence qualified to run for the seat. "We have abandoned that lie which was made in a press conference that the candidate did not complete his education at Kenya Polytechnic," Wanyama told the panel chaired by Willis Otieno. He added, "Based on this development, we wish to confirm that Arati possesses genuine degree certificates and diplomas which I have personally confirmed from the examinations council." The complainants had claimed Arati did not have the required educational qualifications further alleging that his degree certificate was a forgery. The lawyer representing Arati prayed for the matter to be dismissed with costs since his client had been defamed.
