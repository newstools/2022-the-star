Blogger Sharon Mundia, aka 'This is Ess', thought she had met the one, at the age of 23. In a Q and A, Sharon was asked if she had her life figured out at 23. The content creator responded by saying she was too young to do some of the things she did. "I have the worst memory but by my math, I was 23 when I started blogging. So did I have my life figured out? Hell no!" she said. "I had no idea what I was doing with my career, the man I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with wasn't in my life anymore, my closest friends weren't in the country." Sharon was married to Lonina Leteipan and they have a daughter together.
