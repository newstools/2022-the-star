Two-time former Kenya National Rally Championship winner Alastair Cavenagh is coming out of injury-induced early retirement from rallying for a final 'one-off' appearance at the inaugural Rally Cross Motorsports festival. The event, set for July 9/10, is being organised by Cavenagh's former teammate and multiple KNRC and Safari Rally champion Carl Flash Tundo in Machakos. "I am greatly looking forward to it," said Cavenagh who has not sat in a rally car in over five years and who was forced into early retirement due to a neck injury. "I have no idea what car I will be driving but I am confident that after a few laps, I should be near the required pace to compete at a reasonable level." Fans will be treated to two days of non-stop action involving some of the great names and hero of yesteryears Motorsports in Kenya, said Cavenagh. "Flash has dragged me out of retirement for one final event to support his inaugural motorsport festival in Machakos. I have not sat in a rally car for almost five years. I had to retire from the sport because of a back and neck injury," revealed Cavenagh. "I am looking forward to the event which will almost definitely be the last time I will drive competitively. I hope that motorsport fans across the country will turn out en masse to support this exciting new annual extravaganza."
