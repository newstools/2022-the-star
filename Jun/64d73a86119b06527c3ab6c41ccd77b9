The IEBC returning officer for Mwingi North constituency, Martin Malonza, has ruled out any possibility of unfair polls, saying they have cutting-edge technology to secure votes. Malonza spoke in Meru town on Tuesday after the conclusion of a four-day training for journalists from Eastern region on coverage of elections. In the capacity-building session, journalists were inducted on how the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission uses technology to make the elections transparent, free and fair. The 60 scribes were exhorted to help allay fears about possible manipulation of the August 9 polls. Malonza said Kenyas should not be worried as they go to the elections as the process is extremely secure. "I want to assure our people that the system is so secure and there is no way anyone can interfere with results from the 54,000 polling stations in the country," Malonza said. He said if armed with the right information journalists will help debunk the lies peddled against IEBC. Malonza said IEBC is using tamper-proof Kenya Integrated Election Management System that not only identifies voters but also transmits results electronically. He said the commission will also allow political parties’ agents, observers and media to access polling centres a sign of openness. "It is a collaborative effort to ensure that our elections are credible and verifiable," he said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
