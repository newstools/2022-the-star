The government has put on notice individuals destroying campaign billboards and posters in Kirinyaga county. County commissioner Moses Ivuto said there have been numerous complaints by aspirants whose billboards have been pulled down or defaced by unknown people. He warned anyone caught destroying campaign posters and billboards will be charged in court. “Those destroying banners, posters and billboards are hereby warned that they risk prosecution should they continue with their wicked  activities. We will not tolerate this because the democracy to seek votes cannot thrive in an unconducive environment,” Ivuto said. He said the government will also not tolerate disruption of political meetings. He said those hired to heckle or disrupt political meetings will be arrested. The administrator spoke in Kerugoya during Madaraka Day celebrations on Wednesday. Ivuto said all candidates have a right to market their manifestos without being booed or their political meetings disrupted. During Azimio la Umoja presidential running mate Martha Karua’s homecoming, six people were arrested for allegedly heckling and pelting her convoy with stones in Kagumo and Kerugoya. “We have already arrested some and will continue nabbing those sent to destroy other people's meetings. If you are confident of a win, why then should you send goons to heckle your opponents?” he posed. He said presidential candidates have a right to visit the county and market their bids without being turned away. Ivuto urged residents not to allow politicians to divide them as they will need each other after the campaigns. “We all have a responsibility in maintaining a peaceful country by ensuring we carry out mature politics. Let us tolerate one another irrespective of our political differences. Remember we still need one another after the polls,” he said. Edited by A.N
