ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna has endorsed Jubilee party candidate Harrison Mwangi Wangoro for Embakasi North parliamentary seat. Orange party candidate Jane Muringi has, however, rejected calls from Sifuna to step down. Wangoro and Muringi are facing off with United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate James Gakuya in the race for the seat. Sifuna at a rally in Embakasi North on Saturday said Raila has promised Muringi a job in his government after the August polls. It is during the rally that the SG  said Muringi had been convinced to step down for  Wangoro. “Raila Odinga has sent me a message to ODM Jane Muringi to step down on behalf of Wangoro Mwangi (Jubilee) and we will slot her for another job in Raila Odinga secretariat,” Sifuna said. He said the member parties of Azimio have agreed to respect zoning criteria agreed upon by both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. However, Muringi has told the Star that she won't step down for anyone unless compelled by Raila or president Uhuru Kenyatta. “I would like to send this message to ODM S.G Edwin Sifuna, kindly concentrate on your bid for senate and that of Raila Odinga and stop taking side shows," she said. Muringi said that negotiations have been ongoing and she is determined to face off with her opponents. She claimed she wasn't invited to a rally where Wangoro was unveiled as the Azimio candidate. Wangoro on his part welcomed Sifuna's endorsement. “I’m very happy for our brothers in ODM as they respect the spirit of Azimio la Umoja and for My sister Jane Muringi, we will work together to make the lives of our people better,’ Wangoro said. During the Saturday rally, Sifuna was accompanied by Azimio governor candidate Polycarp Igathe, MP candidates Beatrice Elachi (Dagoretti North), Philip Kaloki (Deputy Governor candidate), George Aladwa (Madaraka), Mureithi Mweje and Rachel Shebesh among others.
