Kenya Commercial Bank head coach Japheth Munala yesterday said losing the national league title to Kenya Prisons last year inspired his charges to win the 2022 Africa Volleyball Club Championship. The Lionesses stunned record holders Al Ahly 3-1 in the final on Tuesday night to seal the title for the first time in 16 years. Munala believes his charges are set for a domineering period both locally and internationally if their latest success is anything to go by. "The pain of losing the title to Prisons last year was tough to bear. We had the pressure to deliver the title this year and luckily, we've managed the prestigious African trophy," said an elated Munala. He went on: "The team has remarkedly improved. We are going guns blazing for the league title with the same energy and desire. We owe this success to the players who had a point to prove." Sharon Chepchumba bagged the Most Valuable Player accolade while Malkia strikers' captain Mercy Moim was feted as the best receiver. Team captain Edith Wisa was the best middle blocker. Wisa said the challenge for KCB now is to maintain the standards but assured that the players are up to the challenge. "I am proud of what we have achieved as a team. We navigated through all the challenges to be crowned Africa's finest but this is not the time to rest on our laurels. It's easy to be a champion but maintaining the standards comes with added pressure. It calls for consistency and hard work," she affirmed. After her achievement, Chepchumba said she has a lot of offers on the table but will need time to analyze them before plotting her next move. "Honestly, I have a lot of offers but I need time first to assess them. I have matured in the game and I know what it takes to be a top professional player. It is a dream to win the title with KCB but I also believe it is time to uplift my game and maybe move to a different level."
