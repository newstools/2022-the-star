Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi now wants his backyard to support leaders vying on his party ticket, and not those seeking seats on Deputy President William Ruto's UDA. In a video seen by the Star, Mudavadi told Vihiga residents not to embarrass him by voting in UDA candidates since the area is perceived as his political bastion “If you look keenly, do you think Sugoi residents can elect an ANC MP in their backyard despite some of us being on one Coalition?” Mudavadi posed. “Let’s be honest and say the truth as much we are going to form a government, yes, but Ruto's home MP will be from the UDA party." He added: "don’t embarrass me in this forthcoming general election; just give me ANC MP in my backyard". Mudavadi pleaded with residents in his local dialect while in the Sabatia constituency on Wednesday night. Mudavadi was campaigning for Emanuel Ayodi of ANC who is seeking Sabatia MP Seat that is currently held by Alfred Agoi who is eyeing the Vihiga Governor Seat. Ayodi will be battling with Clement Sloya of UDA, Ibii Kidunduhu of ODM, Ikumu Arafat (independent) among other candidates in the race His sentiments came after Vihiga UDA candidates vowed to vote six-piece pattern from the presidency to the MCA seat. “We are going to vote for UDA candidates in this forthcoming elections here in Vihiga. We have no Kenya Kwanza candidates,” Jackeline Mwenesi, who is vying for the woman rep seat said. “We want Senator UDA, MCA UDA, and Woman Rep UDA MP UDA, in fact, that MP position by 9 am will be a done deal,” she added. Mwenesi was addressing the press last Friday after being cleared by IEBC to contest in a bid to oust the incumbent Beatrice Adagala of ANC.
