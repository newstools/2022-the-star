The Ministry of Health has urged Kenyans to prioritise wearing facemasks and vaccination as the country heads to the cold season. Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Monday said the continued upsurge in infections is a concern to the ministry. Kagwe said Kenyans in confined places such as PSVs, aircraft, offices, supermarkets and places of worship will have to wear masks. "Political indoor meetings are super-spreaders events. We also require worshippers to wear face masks when inside places of worship to contain the virus," Kagwe said. He warned of an increase in Covid-19 cases in the country as the country moves into the cold season. He noted the weekly average has gone up from 0.6 per cent at the beginning of May to 10.4 per cent this week. "The sharp rise in infections should mean something to our country and we must once again take steps to prevent a slide into a crisis like the one we experienced in 2020 and 2021 when we lost many lives and resources," Kagwe said. Kagwe at the same time appealed for immediate vaccination to those yet to receive the jab saying all Kenyans should take necessary precautions. "Those who have not been vaccinated should do so immediately. Those who have been vaccinated and need a booster shot should do so immediately," Kagwe noted. The increase in cases is so far not associated with increased hospitalisations. The majority of cases are under the home-based care program. Kagwe said the steady increase in infections is likely to get worse in the coming weeks due to the cold weather. "It is important for us to appreciate that we are faced with a number of challenges that are going to affect these numbers. The first one is that we are in a political season where everybody is out there in the open, many gatherings continuously at all times," the CS added.
