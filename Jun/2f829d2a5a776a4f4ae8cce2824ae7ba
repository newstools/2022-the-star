Businesswoman Betty Kyallo has rubbished claims she only dates rich men. Betty, on her Instagram stories, shared a screenshot of a Facebook account that had her photo and a claim that she only dates men with big cars and a lot of money. Betty said she respects people's hustles and has never made such a statement. "Utter nonsense. Fake," she wrote. Betty said people create such fake posts just to get clicks and numbers online. Betty said she has never been impressed by cars and asked her fans to ignore the post. "We all gotta work hard no easy way out. That's the only thing I always advocate for; Hard work," she said. "Also, everyone's hustle and journey is to be celebrated. We all have to start from somewhere. Cars don't impress me. Good day."
