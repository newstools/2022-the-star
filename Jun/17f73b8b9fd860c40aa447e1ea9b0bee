Davis & Shirtliff has appointed its long-serving finance director George Mbugua as the new CEO, taking over from David Gatende who retires this month after 36 years with the company. The change of guard comes as the water and energy solutions provider is redefining its distribution strategy to capture the bigger African market, improve customer experience and play an even bigger role in helping the continent address perennial water and energy challenges. Announcing the management change, Davis & Shirtliff chairman Alec Davis hailed Gatende as an exceptional colleague having joined the company in 1986 as a young sales engineer. ''David’s departure has initiated a number of changes to the executive team and I particularly welcome long-serving CFO George Mbugua as David’s CEO successor,'' Davis said. The new CEO holds a Master of Business Administration (Marketing) from the University of Leicester and a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce from Strathmore University. He is a Certified Public Accountant (Kenya) having started his career at Deloitte. “I feel honoured by the opportunity to contribute towards further building this world-class organisation that solves important problems for and addresses critical needs of Africa’s people,'' Mbugua said. Founded 76 years ago in Westlands, Nairobi, the company is now the leading supplier of water and energy-related equipment in the East Africa region. Davis & Shirtliff has a presence in 11 countries and participates in seven product segments all focused on providing energy and water solutions. A particular focus is its growing presence in the solar energy business where it is already a market leader. Other activities include surface and borehole water pumping, water treatment, swimming pools, power generation and irrigation where it sells many products under its own brand Dayliff as well as other international suppliers.
