Mathare Jubilee aspirant Kevin Kioko popularly known as Bahati has dismissed as false claims that he has stepped down. The musician claimed that some Azimio La Umoja members have been causing confusion among his supporters by alleging that he has withdrawn his bid. “Dear Azimio… stop misleading the voters of Mathare. Bahati – MP Mathare has not stepped down for anyone," Bahati said in a Facebook post on Monday. He said he would be addressing the media over the matter at 2pm. Bahati's remarks followed revelations that Azimio had settled on Anthony Oluoch as its preferred candidate during a joint meeting of ODM and Jubilee delegates. Jubilee and ODM are constituent parties of Azimio and have in some regions reached boardroom deals to front a single candidate against their Kenya Kwanza opponents. A case in point is when Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi (ODM) shelved his ambition to support Polycarp Igathe (Jubilee) in the Nairobi governor race.
