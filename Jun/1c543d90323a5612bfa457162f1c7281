Kisumu All Starlets are banking on their recent form as they seek to avoid relegation when they tackle Kayole Starlets at Stima Cub in their Kenya Women's Premier League final match of the season, Sunday. Kisumu have 20 points, one better off both Kayole and Bunyore. Kayole were on Thursday awarded three points after protesting against Trans Vzoia Falcons' move to change match venue late, thus forcing the abandonment of the encounter. With two teams expected to join Kangemi Ladies in Division One, fireworks loom. "Beating both Trans-Nzoia Falcons(2-1) and former champions Thika Queens 1-0 is enough evidence that we have what it takes to beat Kayole. Football is about 90 minutes, we feel less pressure because we know what our players can do," Berryl Oketch, Kisumu team manager said. Newbies Bunyore could face baptism of fire at their backyard if Vihiga coach Boniface Nyamunyamu's sentiments is anything to go by. Nyamunyamu said they won't spare their 'sisters' Bunyore since they are chasing an unbeaten record. "We are going to play for maximum points. If they have to win let them win but for us, the intention is to end the season unbeaten, " Nyamunyamu stated. Falcons will not honour their match against Gaspo citing biasness by the Football Kenya Federation Transition Committee following their move to award Kayole the abandoned clash between the two sides. "We read malice in the decision. If it's about making Kayole survive, well... but we are not traveling to Nairobi. The morale in camp is low and players haven't trained for the last two days. How many times have we played in Nairobi after the venue was changed at the last minute?  quipped Falcons coach Justine Okiring.
