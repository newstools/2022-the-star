Wiper Democratic Movement has formally written to the Independent Electoral and boundaries commission notifying them of Kalonzo Musyoka's withdrawal from the presidential contest. In a letter to the commission's chairperson and national returning officer Wafula Chebukati, the party said Musyoka will not be presenting his nomination papers for clearance on Saturday as scheduled. "By strength of this letter, we notify your office that he will not be presenting his papers as earlier scheduled," read the letter in part signed by Agatha Solitei, the party's national elections board chair. It further reads, "kindly acknowledge receipt of this notification by stamping the duplicate of this letter". "Musyoka was set to appear before the commission on June 4, a day Deputy President William Ruto is also presenting his documents for clearance." On Thursday, the presidential candidate made an about-turn throwing his weight behind Azimio-Oka candidate Raila Odinga. This now means, Ruto will be the sole candidate to face Chebukati- clearance panel on Saturday. Azimio la Umoja candidate Raila Odinga has a date with the commission on Sunday. Meanwhile, the commission continued to clear various candidates at the Bomas ahead of the June 6 deadline. On Friday morning, one more candidate James Kamau was disqualified after failing to present the required documents despite being granted three chances.
