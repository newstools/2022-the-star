West Mugirango United Progressive Alliance party candidate Fred Makamara has denied reports that he has stepped down for another candidate. He accused some leaders of lying to his supporters. Makamara is among other hopefuls targeting to unseat Vincent Kemosi. Those eyeing the seat are city-based lawyer Stephen Mogaka (Jubilee) businessman Rodgers Moturi (UPA), and Charles Ongoto (UDA) among others. He spoke to journalists in Nyamira on Wednesday after an article on social media claimed he had met ODM leader Raila Odinga and Moturi, where he allegedly stepped down for him. Makamara said the article was meant to taint his name and deceive his supporters. “We have never had any meeting. I am going to be on the ballot. Avoid any misleading information,” he said. “There is a need for us to have leaders who can bring real change to the people and therefore they should elect leaders who cannot fail them.” Makamara said he is committed to reviving the status of West Mugirango to ensure there is service delivery to the people of West Mugirango. This, he said, would need a change of leadership.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
