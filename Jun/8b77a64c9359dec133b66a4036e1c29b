Police should stop the extra-judicial execution of innocent civilians, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has urged. Kalonzo spoke on Saturday during the burial of the four people killed in a shooting in the Masimba area, Kajiado County on June 2. Kamba and Kajiado leaders who graced the burial of the victims termed the killings as“extra-judicial execution”. Speaking during the church service, Kalonzo said from time immemorial, humans have harmoniously co-existed with wildlife. “It thus deeply aggrieves me that in the guise of conservation, Stanley Ntidu Tereu, Duncan Kabari Munke, Letomir Topoika, and Dennis Matheka Mutua had their promising lives cut short by some members of our GSU,” said Musyoka. He remarked at the World Arising Church, Grace City in Masimba, during a mass service for the departed souls. Musyoka said the four who died in a hail of bullets were spectators during a demonstration against Kenya Wildlife Service by Maasai women whose children had been locked out of school because of the invasion of elephants into their farm. The Wiper leader was joined by former Kajiado governor David Nkedianye, governor Joseph Lenku, Environment CS Keriako Tobiko, MP Peris Tobiko, and Daniel Manzo. This was the first time he was appearing in public after reports that he had flown out of the country together with ODM leader Raila Odinga. Others were Tarayia Kores, ODM secretary-general Edwin Sifuna, Senator Judith Pareno, and the area MCA Henry Kimiti. The leaders asked that those responsible must be brought to book as soon as humanely possible. CS Tobiko said: “We mourn the loss and pray with their families today in a way of showing solidarity with our people at this time of grief.” Nkedianye said a permanent solution to the jumbo menace in opening up wildlife corridors in Kajiado and Makueni counties should be acted upon immediately.
