Homeboyz fast-rising star David Odhiambo Okoth is banking on the remaining two matches to seal the Kenya Premier League title. Okoth, who was crowned Kakamega Homeboyz Player of the Month for April, said they intend to capitalise on the remaining matches to realize their dream of a maiden title, which slipped through their fingers last season. The league is currently a  two-horse race with Homeboyz and Tusker chasing the top honours.  The midfielder was feted last weekend despite a  2-0 defeat to 13-time KPL champions AFC Leopards. “I  want to thank God for this award. I also want to thank my teammates and the technical bench for making it possible for me. This means a lot for me as a player and it's great motivation as we seek to seal the title," he said. Okoth said it was a good feeling to be among the title contenders this year. “We are not taking any chances. We still have a chance to win it and we will do everything within our powers to win the title,” said a confident Okoth. As far as Homeboyz are concerned, Okoth said it isn't over until it is over. “We shall fight to the bitter end," he added. He noted: "We still have two matches which are a must-win for us. As a team, we still believe we will win the title,” he said. The Kakamega-based club face FC Talanta on Saturday before concluding the league with Kariobangi Sharks next Saturday.
