A Kakamega voter has moved to court seeking to bar IEBC from clearing Kakamega governor aspirant Cleophas Malala, claiming he does not have a degree certificate. Fred Muka claims that Malala’s alleged USIU degree is not authentic so he does not qualify to vie for the Governor position. Through lawyer Duncan Okatch, Muka has further said the legislator's KCSE certificate from Kamusinga High School is also not genuine. Muka claims Malala does not have the requisite papers to be cleared to vie for the Kakamega Governor seat. According to court papers, Malala’s USIU degree certificate has inconsistencies, irregularities and contradictions that have them believe that it’s not authentic. In a recent interview, Senator Malala was put to task to explain why his certificate read 2019 yet he claims to have graduated sometime between 2010 and 2011. In the interview with a local TV station, the vocal senator struggled to recall the exact date and year of his graduation, dismissing questions from the journalist who wanted clarity on the contradicting dates. “Ndio nakuambia kama hukufanya degree huwezi jua,” Malala stated. This loosely translates to "If you didn’t graduate with a degree then these things may be difficult to follow." Malala who is vying for the Kakamega gubernatorial seat on a ANC party ticket in the August 9 polls, has been fighting allegations of forging his academic certificates. For one to qualify for the position of a county governor in Kenya, he or she must among others; be a holder of a degree from a University recognised in Kenya.
