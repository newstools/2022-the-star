Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo has said he has put up measures to boost early childhood education. In a statement read on his behalf by Nyamira finance executive Emily Ongaga, Nyaribo said there was a need to build more ECDE classrooms to boost intake. “This is an integral part of human development and for the last nine years, child health and early education have occupied a central position in our budgetary allocation,” he said. Nyaribo spoke during a sensitisation programme on Thursday, dubbed Smart Start initiative. The event was spearheaded by Kisumu Medical Education Trust. Nyaribo said his government has greatly invested in the health sector to improve livelihoods. “This includes expansion of basic and integral maternal and child health services and renovation of health facilities to provide integrated maternal and child health services,” he said. The governor also said the county government has put in place measures to ensure the availability of enough oxygen supply for those in need,  and to match the increasing demands as the country battles Covid-19. Nyaribo highlighted some achievements since the inception of county governments. “Infant mortality rate has significantly dropped from 46 per cent in 2012 to 27 per cent,” he said. “Skilled delivery has increased from 62 per cent to 95 per cent, therefore, I request more partnerships now and in the future.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
