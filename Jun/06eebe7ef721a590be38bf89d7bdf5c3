Potato pancakes are crispy on the outside and creamy delicious on the inside. Here is how you can put leftover potatoes into good use. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a medium bowl, combine the potatoes and all the ingredients except the oil. Add water to form a thick paste. Step 2 Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Step 3 Heat a large pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of butter. Step 4 Pour the mixture to form small round circles and fry for about 3 to 4 minutes before turning. Flip over and fry the other side before removing. Step 5 Drain excess oil on a plate covered in serviettes or paper towels. Step 6 Repeat with remaining potato pancakes. Sauté the remaining onions and serve with the potato pancakes.  Enjoy with a fresh cup of coffee or preferred beverage.
