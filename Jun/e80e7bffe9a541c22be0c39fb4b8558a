Parents in Kabete, Kiambu, have asked the government to increase CDF funds to enable schools to expand and build more classrooms for junior secondary. The funds will also help more needy students to pay school fees. They said the CDF kitty has helped rehabilitate primary schools that were built in the 1970s and 1980s. "We have seen the CDF used to refurbish both primary and secondary schools to appear beautiful just like private schools. This has motivated our students to work hard to compete with those in private schools,” parent Jencita Wanjiku said. Parent Michael Ndung'u said if the government gives more cash for the CDF kitty, more learners will be assisted, especially now that the CBC is being implemented. Kabete MP Githua Wamacukuru said the CDF kitty has helped build classrooms, renovate those in deplorable conditions, connect schools with water supply, start feeding programmes and issue bursaries to the needy. "Many primary and secondary schools were old and rusty, had broken window panes and had rough walls," he said. "When we did all that in many of the schools, we realised that the performance of learners started improving, lateness and absenteeism reduced." They spoke at Karura Kanyungu Primary School on Tuesday when the MP attended the institution's prize-giving day and opened newly built classrooms which were funded using the CDF cash. Edited by A.N
