Ndulele Conservancy off the Moi North Lake road will for the second year running serve as World Rally Championships (WRC) Safari Rally venue for Shakedown on  June 22 from 10:01hrs onwards. Shakedowns are meant to offer opportunities for crews to test their competition cars on terrain similar to the rally before the event starts. Competitors must drive through the shakedown stage at least three times, with all passes being timed. The challenging 5.4kms of Kenyan rally tracks will see the first action of a WRC Rally1 hybrid-powered car at a competitive pace on African soil. The ground-breaking new-generation Rally1 cars from three manufacturers (Ford M-Sport, Toyota Gazoo Racing and Hyundai WRT) competed for the first time in the season-opening WRC Rallye Monte-Carlo on January 20-23. The event, sponsored by KCB Bank to a tune of Sh100 million, Kenya Wildlife Service and Toyota Kenya will provide a great spectator experience, according to WRC Safari Rally CEO Phineas Kimathi. Kimathi said this year's edition will once again retain its fabled reputation as the 'World's Toughest Rally'. "It will be the first time ever that the P1 cars will have been driven on any other surface other than Europe. We are proud of being the first country in Africa to host the Rally 1 hybrid-powered cars where crews will savour their first feel of the spectacular challenge ahead," Kimathi explained. Kimathi, who is also the KMSF chairman, revealed that the Shakedown will precede reconnaissance of the Kasarani Spectator Stage (SS1) where Priority 1 drivers will use their WRC Rally1 cars from 07.30hrs on  June 23. Thereafter, crews will proceed to Kenyatta International Convention Centre at 11:00hrs for a press conference to be followed by the Ceremonial Start at 12:46hrs. From 14:08hours on June 23, the first two cars will tackle the Super Special Stage (SSS) at Kasarani. Kimathi quipped: "It's only on Safari where two cars race against each other at the same time in a WRC set-up." The Safari will take place in the Great Rift Valley, around Lake Naivasha and Elmenteita with the Service Park returning to the Kenya Wildlife Services Institute in Naivasha on the main Nairobi-Nakuru Road. Administrative checks will begin on June 19 in Naivasha and reconnaissance will start on  June 20 from 0700hrs. Reconnaissance will continue from June 21 through to June 22. Shakedown for Priority 1 and other invited drivers will take place from 10:01-11:30 hours followed by FIA P2, P3 and P4 drivers from 11:31 to12:30hours. Non-priority drivers will start at 12:31 to 14:00hours. Action proper begins on June 24 with SS2/5 Loldia 1 & 2, a 19.17kms stage that will be run at 08:00hrs and 13:14hrs through to Hells Gate "Wolf Power Stage" on Sunday, June 26.
