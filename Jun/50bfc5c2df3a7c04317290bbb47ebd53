A National Health Service doctor in England UK has advised couples against sleeping next to each other in the same bed, if they want to get a proper night sleep. According to Dr Karan Raj, who boasts more than 3.4 million followers on TikTok, says co-sleeping could be affecting your overall wellbeing. He explained that people have different sleep cycles, so forcing them to share a bed could result in them becoming chronically sleep-deprived. “You should always sleep alone, if the other person moves in their sleep or snores that will stop you getting into the deep stages of sleep your body needs to recharge, affecting sleep quality,” he shared in the video below. Dr Raj added that sleeping in separate beds is a good idea because it triggers the ‘drift off’ experience and can also result in sharing body heat. This means that it will take longer for you to fall asleep. He also works as a surgeon and lecturer at the University of Sunderland, United Kingdom. The question is, would you stop sharing your bed with your partner?
