Menengai Oilers coach Gibson Weru believes the side has what it takes to win a leg of the national Sevens circuit. The Kenya Cup finalists reached the semifinals in both the Kabeberi and Christie Sevens tournaments, losing to KCB on both occasions, and say it's only a matter of time before they get into the final and win with four legs remaining. “We have been to two semis and there is no doubt we are knocking on the big door. We will make a couple of adjustments and by the time we go for the Driftwood Sevens in a fortnight, there will definitely be an improvement,” said Weru. The tactician said the team has to focus on their mental fortitude especially when they get to the semifinals of the Sevens tournaments. "When you get to the semis, mental strength and proper preparations play a big part. This is one area I think we have to do better," he observed. The Nakuru-based side lost 17-12 to KCB in sudden death a match, which Weru described as a final before the final. "Credit to the boys for fighting till sudden death. We learnt our lessons and going forward, we will be sharper,” he added.  The former Kenya Sevens playmaker said he expects competition to get better moving forward. “The circuit is competitive. Teams like Strathmore and KCB look strong.  Homeboyz and Mwamba are thereabouts while Nakuru and Western Bulls have emerged as surprise outfits.  So it's wide open and on any given day the Sevens game is unpredictable,” said Weru. The national Sevens circuit has taken a break for the next fortnight to pave way for the Simbas Currie Cup clashes against Leopards and Eastern Province for the next two weekends at the RFUEA ground. The circuit will resume with the Driftwood Sevens on June 18-19 at the Mombasa Sports Club. The Dala Sevens will then take the centre stage in Kisumu from July 2-3 followed by the Prinsloo Sevens in Nakuru (July 9-10) and the Kakamega Sevens (July 16-17) at the Bullring.
