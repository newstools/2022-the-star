Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said there are no plans to zone candidates in Vihiga county. The lawmaker spoke on Monday, saying negotiated democracy will only apply in specific Azimio areas. "We want all parties in Azimio to promote Raila's bid to state house," Osotsi said. His remarks came after rumors emerged there are possibilities of zoning in Vihiga. Analysts say if Azimio goes for zoning in Luanda constituency, Albert Obbuyi of Jubilee and Dick Maungu of DAP-K will be elbowed out of the race. This is to narrow the contest into a two-horse race between the incumbent, Chris Omulele of ODM, and Vihiga majority leader Tom Atingo. Other candidates who could be dropped include Leo Ongadi and Aineah Makanga of DAP-K, who are contesting for the Senate and MP seats respectively. Mary Amalemba (DAP-K)  and  Winnie Majani (ODM), who are contesting for the woman rep seat, also risk being dropped in favour of Violet Bagada of UDP. Initially, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri, who is vying for the governor's seat, had urged ODM leader Raila Odinga not to interfere with the local politics. "Baba just focus on your top seat and leave us down here to fight our own wars," Khaniri said. "We are going to deliver the presidential seat under Azimio, that one is assured." (Edited by Tabnacha O)
