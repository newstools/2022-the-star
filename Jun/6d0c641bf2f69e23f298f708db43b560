Mastercard signed a partnership with the Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) to aid the tourism sector to rebound to its pre-pandemic state last week on Wednesday. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between KTB and Mastercard aims at driving the growth of tourism in Kenya. "With Mastercard aligned with KTB’s strategy of expanding our partner ecosystem to strengthen the sector and deliver on the goal of bouncing back fully to pre-2019 levels within the next 2 years," KTB CEO  Betty Radier said. The MoU also involves increasing transparency on tourism trends, anonymized traveller profiles and economic impact through Mastercard’s Data. It will also explore a loyalty and rewards program to boost tourism and impact the effect of marketing strategies, including using its Priceless.com platform. Priceless.com is a platform that will be used for campaigns to complement the tourism recovery efforts and access to discounts for Mastercard holders. Mastercard Vice Chairman and President for Strategic Growth Michael Froman said that tourism is a critical sector for driving employment in any country. "At Mastercard, we’re committed to helping countries come out of this pandemic with stronger, more resilient and inclusive economic growth," he said. He went ahead to add that they add insights and assets to the table so as to help Kenya's tourism industry recover from the Covid-19 effects. Mastercard and KTB partnership will also enhance the proposition by including bespoke travel packages. This is Mastercard's first three-year collaboration in Africa. With Kenya having many beautiful destinations, the MoU will work to ensure over 3 billion cardholders around the world are reached.
