Zambian Super League giants, Zesco United, have extended the contract of Kenyan forward Vincent Oburu for another three years. The 24-year-old former Wazito and AFC Leopards talisman has been in great form after landing a short-term deal with the Ndola-based club four months ago. He was instantly absorbed into the squad after impressing coach Numba Mumanga in the trials. A statement published on Zesco's official portal quoted Mumanga expressing delight with Oburu's willingness to pen a new deal. Mumanga said he was pegging his hopes on Oburu to steer the side to unprecedented glory in the continental showpiece. “We are very happy as a technical bench because the period that we gave Oburu to prove himself, he did wonders. We only hope that what he showed us is what he will give us in the upcoming season and in CAF competition,” Mumamba said. Oburu endeared himself to the Zesco United faithful after netting a goal in a crunch tie against traditional arch-rivals, Nkana. However, he suffered a major setback after sustaining a career threatening injury that incapacitated him for the better part of the season. Editing by Tony Mballa
