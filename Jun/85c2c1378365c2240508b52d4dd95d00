The inaugural edition of the Nyamira Great Run 21-km race will now be concluded on June 19, according to the organisers. The race was initially scheduled for December 13 but was postponed indefinitely to give athletes time to register and prepare properly. Nyamira County Sports Minister, Grace Nyamongo said the event will run on Chepilat-Ikonge Road. The race will start at Chepilat Shopping Centre on the Nyamira/Bomet border and finish at Ikonge Primary School, according to Nyamongo. Winners in the men’s and women’s categories will pocket Sh250, 000. Nyamongo said the full prize structure will be released later with organisers expected to award the top five runners and local winners. The registration fee is Sh1,000 and those wishing to participate should register using Mpesa pay bill number 8043785. Nyamongo said they expect a huge field of elite and amateur runners to take part in the event and asked athletes to register in large numbers. The 21kms race is the final event of five-part road races and cross-country series which were held in all the five sub-counties. Nyamongo said the events were successful. “The series helped in unearthing some talent and rekindling the spirit of athletics in Nyamira County. We are hoping to stage a successful final event,” she added. Speaking separately, Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South chairman, Peter Angwenyi, appealed to sponsors to come on board and support the race. So far, Cooperative Bank and Helsinki Hotel in Nyamira have come on board.
