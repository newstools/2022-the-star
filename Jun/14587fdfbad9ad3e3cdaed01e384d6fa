APS Bomet consolidated their position at the apex of the National Super League log following a hard-fought 1-0 win over Naivas at the IAAF Bomet Stadium on Wednesday. First-half substitute Lawrence Kibet converted from the spot to secure the crucial win for the league leaders who have bagged 63 points thus far. Kibet was introduced early in the game after Duke Muhoro limped off with an injury. Fortune Sacco reclaimed the second spot after beating Mombasa Elite 2-0 at Kianyaga Stadium. Jacob Kareno's brace in the second half was all the Nichodemus Omasete-coached team needed to fire their tally to 57 points. Their ascension was made easier after Muhoroni Youth who had held the second spot heading into Wednesday's encounters crushed 1-0 to SS Assad at Shamu Grounds to slump to third with 56 points. Kisii-based Shabana squeezed out a slim 1-0 win over Vihiga United to go fifth on the log with 50 points. Murang'a Seal went sixth after a hard-fought 3-2 win over Mwatate United at Wundanyi Stadium. Coastal Heroes momentarily put their relagation worries aside after rallying from a goal down to pip Mara Sugar 2-1 at Serani Sports in Mombasa. Mara's Victor Nguma drew the first blood to put the visitors ahead but goals from Marcus Jairo and Ali Halafu later in the game overturned the deficit. MCF dislodged Naivas from the fourth spot following an emphatic 3-0 win over Kibera Black Stars, courtesy of goals from Ezekiel Okare, Kevince Ochieng, and Alex Waiswa. Silibwet Leons stunned former Kenyan Premier League side Kisumu All Stars 4-2. Gusii FC and Migori Youth both earned walkovers after Dandora Love and Zoo Kericho failed to show up.
