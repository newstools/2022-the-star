Bahati Member of Parliament Kimani Ngunjiri urged Bahati residents to re-elect Governor Lee Kinyanjui in the upcoming August 9 poll. The legislator urged Nakuru residents to consider the incumbent governor and not Senator Susan Kihika who is also in the governor race. The move seems to have worsened the feud between Kihika and the MP. Speaking during an event in Bahati on Wednesday, Ngunjiri told the residents that the power was in their hands to elect the candidate that they feel will bring more developments. "Have they forced you to elect them? You know the type of leader to choose and the best person to continue developing the region. The answer for Nakuru is Lee and here in Bahati it is Kimani Ngunjiri," he said. His remarks did not go well with Kihika, who took to her Facebook page to urge her supporters from Bahati Constituency to send the legislator home. "What did that person from Bahati say? If that is how it is going to be, then my Bahati supporters know what they ought to do. This time around the old man should go home," the post read. This is not the first time their feud has played out in the public domain. Last year December, the two claimed they had set aside their differences, with Ngunjiri promising to support Kihika’s governor bid. Ngunjiri said Kihika is like a daughter to him and likened their differences to a family conflict. “I fully support Susan to be Nakuru's first woman governor and she is welcome anytime for consultations and assistance from me,” Ngunjiri had said.
