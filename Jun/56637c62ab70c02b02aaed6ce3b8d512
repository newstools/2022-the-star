When you cook your beef on the grill, heat burns the fats and most of it tends to drip to the surface of the grill. The excess oil that collects on the grill, forms a thick layer of grease. When it comes into contact with dirt, particles of food, and flames, it attracts bacteria and can cause food poisoning or contamination. Here are some of the things that you should get: Step 1 Prepare the vinegar solution by adding equal amounts of water and vinegar in a spray bottle then shake. Step 2 Spray the mixture on the grates on top and bottom of the grill and leave them to soak up for 5 minutes. Step 3 Crample up the aluminium foil and wet it, or the brush, then give the grates a good scrub. Step 4 Rinse with clean water and dry the grates with a kitchen towel. You can also use a cotton cloth to scrub the grates if you are out of aluminum foil.
