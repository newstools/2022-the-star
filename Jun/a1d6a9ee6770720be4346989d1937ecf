Chief Justice Martha Koome now wants President Uhuru Kenyatta impeached for failing to appoint six of the 40 judges nominated by the Judicial Service Commission. In an appeal against the High Court ruling, CJ Koome wants the appeal court to declare that the solution to the President's refusal to appoint the six is his impeachment from office. The High Court had directed the President to swear in the six judges, failure to which, the CJ should do so. The CJ, however, in the appeal case has refused to take up the role and instead seeks the court's declaration that the President has violated Articles 3(1) and 166(1)(b) of the Constitution or any other order that secures direct accountability of the President. "It is proposed that the court makes a declaration that the President... is in violation of Articles 3(1) and 166(1)(b) of the Constitution. A declaration that the appropriate remedy for the violation of Articles 3(1) and 166(1)(b) of the Constitution is the impeachment of the President or any other order that secures direct accountability of the President," Koome said in the court papers. The judges Uhuru refused to appoint are Justices George Odunga, Aggrey Muchelule, Prof Joel Ngugi and Weldon Korir whom the JSC had elevated to the Court of Appeal. Others are chief magistrate Evans Makori and High Court deputy registrar Judith Omange who was promoted to be High Court judge
