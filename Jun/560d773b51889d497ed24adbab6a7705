The National Police Service on Tuesday denied writing a letter banning peaceful demonstrations at the Tanzanian Embassy in Nairobi. The fake letter dated June 14, indicates that it was written by the Regional Police Commander Augustine Nthumbi. It was drafted in response to a request made on June 12, to have police protection for the demonstration scheduled for Wednesday, following the eviction of Maasai in the Ngorongoro area of Tanzania. "The Maasai saga is an internal issue and is politically motivated by some bigshots in Kenya," the now fake letter said. This is the second document that the Service flagged as fake on Tuesday. The Maasai living in Loliondo and Ngorongoro districts have been facing evictions. On Monday, a Tanzanian MP Emmanuel Ole Shangai said 30 men and women have been allegedly injured by the paramilitary and 12 arrested. Arusha Regional Commissioner John Mongella  however, denied knowledge of any injured persons saying there have not been any reports in hospitals. The list released by MP Shangai said thirteen women with broken arms and legs were either taken to Bomet County hospital or other private hospitals in Kenya. On Saturday, President Samia Suluhu dismissed all claims of forced eviction after some photos and videos of injured residents went viral on Twitter. Among the leaders sympathizing with the Serengeti area residents is Narok County Senator Ledama Ole Kina. Ledama on Monday told the Star he has joined forces with other Maasai leaders in taking the Tanzanian government to International Court. “We can no longer stand a government that has no respect for its citizens. We cannot afford to see more blood being spilt for wrong reasons."
