Four out of the five Vihiga lawmakers who are seeking to defend their seats have been cleared by the IEBC. Omboko Milemba (Emuhaya), Ernest Kagesi (Vihiga), Chris Omulele (Luanda) and Charles Gimose (Hamisi) have all been cleared to defend their seats. Sabatia's Alfred Agoi is however not defending his seat after he set his sights on becoming governor. “Today I must say thanks to my supporters for the support they have been giving me since 2017 when I was elected for the first term, it's my prayer the same support will continue,” the lawmaker said​ ​after he was cleared by IEBC at St Bakitas in Emuhaya constituency. Omboko said he is ready for his opponents. The lawmaker will defend his seat in the ANC party which is under the Kenya Kwanza alliance. The lawmaker will be facing Asienga Ebole of ODM and Aineah Maganga of DAP-K under Azimio la Umoja Kenya one. Others who have been cleared include Luanda MP Chris Omulele ODM, Charles Gimose  of ANC Hamisi constituency. Omulele will be facing Tom Atingo of UDA and Dick Maungu of DAP-K. Kagesi of Vihiga will be facing former lawmaker Yusuf Chanzu of UDA, and Ken Vitisia of ODM. Gimose who was also cleared to defend his seat is set to face off 12 opponents at the ballot. For Sabatia constituency, fresh blood in politics takes centre stage as the incumbent MP Alfred Agoi eyes gubernatorial seat. The new blood include Clement Sloya of UDA, Ikumu Arafat independent, Timothy Kidunduhu of ODM and Emanuel Ayodi of ANC. However the cleared candidates have urged all those seeking elective positions to ensure they conduct peaceful elections. “Let’s compete on ideologies that will change the lives of our people, our people are languishing in poverty because of poor policies,” Maungu said. “We have been cleared, let's campaign peacefully and let everybody tell people his agenda, and also let's market our presidential candidates,” Atingo said.
