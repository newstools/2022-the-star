Champions Manchester City face West Ham away on the opening weekend of a 2022-23 Premier League campaign that will include a mid-season break for the World Cup in Qatar. There will be no top-flight games after the weekend of November 12-13 until December 26 because of the World Cup. The first fixture takes place on Friday, August 5 when Crystal Palace host Arsenal. Liverpool play at promoted Fulham, with Nottingham Forest at Newcastle. Forest are back in the Premier League for the first time since 1998-99. The World Cup, which will feature both England and Wales, starts on 21 November. The final is on 18 December, eight days before the Premier League season resumes. There are no meetings between the Premier League’s so-called ‘big six’ on weekend of 12-13 November — the one before the World Cup — following a request by the Football Association.
