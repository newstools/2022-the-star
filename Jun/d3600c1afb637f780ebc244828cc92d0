The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission is seeking the court's permission to start the recovery of Sh13,977,987 from Geoffrey Kimonge Mbogho, a former employee of the County Government of Taita Taveta. According to court documents seen by the Star, Mbogho who was a political advisor to then governor John Mruttu fraudulently received the money as imprest purportedly for allowances of members of the County Assembly and staff of County Government of Taita Taveta. He received the money on diverse dates, between October 9, 2015 and May 17, 2017. "On 13th December, 2016 he fraudulently applied for and received imprest of Kshs 7,233,381/- purportedly as daily subsistence allowance (per diem) for employees of the said County Government traveling to Dubai. Investigations established that he never remitted Kshs. 1,307,997/- to some of the employees of the said County and has never surrendered the imprest," EACC said. "On 22nd December, 2016 he fraudulently applied for and received imprest of Kshs. 2,000,000/- purportedly for conference fees for ten (10) persons travelling to Dubai but never utilized the said amount for the said purposes and has never surrendered the imprest." In the case filed at the Voi Law Courts through Songole B. Asingwa, Advocates, the EACC wants Mbogho to be compelled to refund the money he allegedly acquired illegally. "The Plaintiff prays for judgment against the Defendant for: A declaration that the sum of Kshs. 13,977,987.00 was illegally and fraudulently acquired by the defendant from the County Government of Taita Taveta in breach of public trust," reads the court document. "An order for payment of Kshs. 13,977,987.00 by the Defendant to the Government of Kenya." The Anti-graft body also wants an order of payment of interest at commercial rates of Sh13,977,987 from the date of acquisition of each tranche as enumerated to the date of filing the suit. "Interest at court rates from the date of filing suit till payment in full," EACC added.
