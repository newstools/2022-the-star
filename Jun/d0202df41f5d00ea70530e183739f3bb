Former World Player of the Year Pieter-Steph du Toit will miss South Africa’s opening Test with Wales on Saturday in Pretoria. Du Toit, 29, is still recovering from shoulder surgery, but is expected to be back for the second and third Tests in Bloemfontein and Cape Town. It is a second back-row blow for the Springboks, with number eight Duane Vermeulen already missing. Salmaan Moerat and Elrigh Louw are in line to make debuts from the bench. Moerat, a member of the Springbok squad for last season’s UK tour, is primarily a second-row while Louw plays either lock or flanker. Head coach Jacques Nienaber has opted for an experienced side which has a combined total of 603 caps. Captain Siya Kolisi starts in the back-row with Franco Mostert and Jasper Wiese, while lock Eben Etzebeth will win his 98th cap alongside Lood de Jager. In the front row, Frans Malherbe and Ox Nché will pack down on either side of hooker Bongi Mbonambi. Alongside scrum-half Faf de Klerk the number 10 jersey will be worn by Elton Jantjies selected ahead of Handré Pollard who is a late-comer to the South African camp after playing for Montpellier last week in top 14. Damian Willemse starts at fullback in a backline featuring wings Makazole Mapimpi and Cheslin Kolbe and centres Lukhanyo Am and Damian de Allende. South Africa: Damian Willemse; Cheslin Kolbe, Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Makazole Mapimpi; Elton Jantjies, Faf de Klerk; Ox Nché, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Lood de Jager, Siya Kolisi (capt), Franco Mostert, Jasper Wiese. Replacements: Malcolm Marx, Steven Kitshoff, Vincent Koch, Salmaan Moerat, Elrigh Louw, Kwagga Smith, Herschel Jantjies, Willie le Roux
