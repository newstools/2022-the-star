Kenya Morans will start residential training on June 21 ahead of next month's make-or-break FIBA Basketball World Cup African Qualifiers. Ambrose Kisoi, the Kenya Basketball Federation secretary, confirmed this while disclosing that locals are already training on Sundays for the July 1-3 event. Kenya must not finish lower than the third position in Group D to advance to the second round of the competition. The five best five placed teams will earn the right to represent the continent in the 32-team nation World Cup. Sadat Gaya, the national team's assistant coach who also handles premier league side Thunder, is in charge of the ongoing training. Kisoi said the federation expects the diaspora-based players to join the rest of the squad before the camp starts. Morans started their quest to qualify for the global festival during Window One games in Dakar, Senegal in February. Playing in Group D, Kenya lost all their three games, going down 56-66 to DR Congo, 105-51 to Egypt, and 100-55 to Senegal. The FIBA World Cup will be hosted by the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia from  August 25 to September 10, 2023. In a related development, Kisoi also said the U18 team is also in training at 209 State House Road ahead of the Junior Championship in Kampala, Uganda. Four teams have confirmed participation in the three-day event that starts on June 13. They are Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. KBF, he said, have submitted their budget to the Ministry and are awaiting the approval.
