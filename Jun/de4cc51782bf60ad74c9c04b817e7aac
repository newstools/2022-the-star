Deputy President William Ruto has dismissed remarks by Interior PS Karanja Kibicho that the National Intelligence Service report shows ODM leader Raila Odinga will win, the August elections, by at least 60 per cent of the vote. Addressing the Makueni county economic forum in Wote on Thursday, Ruto said the intelligence report he is privy to is that his camp is ahead. "I am the deputy president of Kenya. After the intelligence report is handed to the president, it comes to me," Ruto said. "In fact, our intelligence report that NIS has released is that Kenya Kwanza is ahead by 8 per cent against our competitors," Ruto said. The DP added the alleged report showing Raila is leading is propaganda crafted by his associates to mislead Kenyans. He dared them to make the report public if they are certain the opposition chief is leading the contest. "I want to challenge the public officials if they are serious about what they are saying, let them publish the report they are talking about that is coming from NIS," he said. In an interview with Citizen TV on Tuesday, May 31, Kibicho divulged that Raila will win the August elections in round one.' He said data in their possession shows the ODM leader is enjoying a commanding lead in the race to State House.
