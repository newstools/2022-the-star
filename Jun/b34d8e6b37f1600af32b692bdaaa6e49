Kayole Starlets wants the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Transition Committee to award them maximum points after Trans-Nzoia Falcons failed to show up for the Kenya Women’s Premier League match on Sunday. The match was set for ASK Showground, Kitale but the hosts changed the venue to Kenyatta Stadium at the last minute without a genuine reason,  according to Kayole coach Joshua Sakwa. Worse still, there was no pre-match communication regarding any changes. “We were with the referees at the Showground ready for the match but Falcons said we should play at Kenyatta Stadium. We protested that decision after seeking advice from the Transition Committee who informed us that the match must go on as scheduled. We deserve to be awarded the points if the FKF constitution is to be followed because we did nothing wrong," said Sakwa. He added: "We also want action to be taken because our opponents hired bodaboda goons to spark chaos. My player Josephine Nana was slapped as they forced us out of the stadium. The refs were also locked out of the field of play. We condemn what transpired in the strongest possible terms. " Sakwa’s sentiments come in the wake of the relegation battle being pushed down the wire this weekend. Kisumu All Starlets shocked Thika Queens 1-0 while Bunyore rescued their eight-match winless run with a 4-2 thumping of already relegated Kangemi Ladies. Kisumu have 20 points while Bunyore 19. Kayole will move level on points with Bunyore should they be awarded three points. Vihiga Queens are the champions while Ulinzi secured second place following their scoreless draw with third-placed Gaspo on Saturday. Two teams will join Kangemi in Division One next season. Bunyore risk facing a baptism of fire in their backyard against Vihiga as Kayole take on Kisumu at Stima Club, Nairobi. Relegation slots might come down to goal difference in case of a tie of points.
