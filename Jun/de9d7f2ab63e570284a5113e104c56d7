Inua Dada founder Janet Mbugua is set to moderate an Instagram Live session with Melinda French Gates on Friday. The live conference will address 'Women, Africa and economic independence'. Janet asked fans online to send questions about influence and leadership. She will also discuss what gaps hinder women's agency, influence and leadership. Those who responded said the imbalanced structures at work and in life make them feel powerless. Melinda Gates is the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which tackles inequity. She is also a philanthropist, businesswoman, author and global advocate for women and girls. Melinda is a devotee of women empowerment across the globe. On Women’s History Month, she took to social media to celebrate and honour three women who are breaking the bias.
