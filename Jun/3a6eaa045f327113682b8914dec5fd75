Luanda MP candidate Dick Maungu has said it’s time to face off politics of handouts and engage in serious development. The DAP-K candidate said Luanda constituency is lagging behind as many people bank on hand-outs. Maungu spoke on Tuesday while addressing voters at his home in Mwibona ward after a road show campaign from Ebusakami, where he was given the IEBC green light to contest for Luanda MP. “We can’t criticise our brother on what he has done for the last two terms. He has tried his best but he should pave the way for change. “We want to sing development, from East to West, so that no group should feel left out,” he said. Maungu said plans for zoning to bar him from contesting were ignored by Azimio, leaving room for them to square it out on the ballot. DAP-K had accused incumbent Christopher Omulele for pushing zoning to bar others from the race. However the lawmaker dismissed the claims saying those on the ballot should compete on ideologies and spread peace messages ahead of polls. “I am urging my brothers to maintain peace and focus on what we shall do to our people,” Omulele said. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo also urged residents not to vote leaders based on hand-outs but development records. "We must elect sober leaders with development oriented minds. Tokens and hand-outs have ruined lives in remote areas," he said. Aspirants who seek to be cleared by the IEBC, for their respective elective seats, have up to June 6. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
