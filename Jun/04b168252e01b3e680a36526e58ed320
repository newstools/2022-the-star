Boston Marathon runners-up Lawrence Cherono has vowed to improve on his Tokyo Olympics performance when he debuts for the country at next month’s World Athletics Championships in Oregon, United States. The Baringo-born athlete, who finished second, is also the 2019 Chicago Marathon champion and 2020 Valencia winner, finished fourth at the Tokyo Olympics, where the world record holder Eliud Kipchoge completed a double. Cherono will have the company of Barnabas Kiptum and two-time New York City Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor during the Oregon event scheduled for July 15 to July 24. Former world marathon champion Geoffrey Kirui is the reserve athlete. Cherono, a two-time Honolulu Marathon champion, said he is really looking forward to the World Championships after the last two athletics seasons were interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. “This will be my second time competing for the country after the Olympic Games last year and I hope to utilize the opportunity well. I am currently training well at Dr. Rosa and Associati Training Camp in Kaptagat,” he added. “The World Championships is the best place for us Kenyans to showcase our unique talent because the whole world will be watching. For me to be at the starting line-up, it’s an honour and I want to reciprocate with good results,” he added. Cherono also holds the Amsterdam Marathon course record and he is also the Prague Marathon champion. He said his elder brother Benson Cherono is his biggest inspiration.
