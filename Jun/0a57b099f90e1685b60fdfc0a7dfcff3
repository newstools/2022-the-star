A contingent of police officers deployed at the Jacaranda grounds on Sunday have been withdrawn. The officers started leaving at around 11.30 am. They said they had been informed the area was now safe, hence the move. “We will provide security for them,” said an officer who spoke to the Star as they left. It’s not clear what informed the move amid tension in the area. A stand-off loomed between security agents and Kenya Kwanza Alliance brigade after they stopped organisers of the alliance's rally from conducting any activities. Police said the cancellation was over security reasons as they had received intelligence goons planned to raid the rally and cause harm to many hence the move to stop it. But in a show of defiance, Deputy President William Ruto who is the head of Kenya Kwanza had earlier on told his supporters to go to the grounds. “The Kenya Kwanza fraternity and the entire Hustler Nation wishes a blessed Sunday to all na tukutane Jacaranda after church,” he said in posts on his social media accounts. The rally had been publicised by among others the now controversial Nairobi gubernatorial candidate Johnson Sakaja, who wanted to use it as a springboard for his bid to be the next boss of the city. “Let them come if they wish but they should know the meeting is not on for today. They can try tomorrow,” said a senior official. Embakasi East MP Paul Ongili alias Babu Owino had also claimed to have booked the grounds for his rally but cancelled Sunday morning. He said he had full rights to use the grounds but preferred his supporters to stay at home. “I had booked Jacaranda Grounds for my function today and notified the police while Ruto booked the same venue on the same day but in 2021 as per their notification letter. I have full rights to use this ground today but let my People stay at home coz we love peace,” Babu said.
