Deputy President William Ruto has arrived at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi for the Kenya Kwanza Women charter conference. The DP is expected to sign the charter that will give women an upper hand in his campaigns. Ruto unveiled the league last Sunday in what pundits say is aimed at neutralising the Azimio wave created by the nomination of Martha Karua as Raila Odinga's running mate. The Karua effect is said to have excited the womenfolk and reduced Ruto's fortunes, especially in Mt Kenya. In his address to the Kenya Kwanza Women's League, Ruto said he enjoys the support of more women voters than his competitors. "I am not the only one saying this; opinion polls have also said it," Ruto said. Ruto said women perform better in tasks compared to men, and as such, the United Democratic Movement party (UDA) which he leads will prioritize them. “I want to commit that as UDA party leader, women will not be there to be seen. They will be there to be heard and to lead,” he added. Those attending the signing of the charter at Nyayo stadium include Ruto's running mate Rigathi Gachagua and ANC Musalia Mudavadi. Others are Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua and his Kilifi counterpart Governor Amason Kingi. Langata MP Nixon Korir and Laikipia Woman Rep Cate Waruguru have also arrived at the venue. William Kabogo, Moses Wetangula, Alice Wahome, Gladys Sholei, ANC secretary general Simon Gikuru, Johnson Sakaja, National assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Ndindi Nyoro and Susan Kihika are also present.
