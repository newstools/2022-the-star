Police were Thursday forced to lob teargas after chaos erupted during the Azimio rally in Moyale, Marsabit County. Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua had visited the volatile county on a vote-hunting mission but rival groups clashed disrupting the rally. Supporters of Pious Yattani, UPIA gubernatorial Candidate, clashed with Governor Ali Mohamud's supporters in Marsabit as both camps wanted space near the dais. The youth had earlier clashed before Raila's arrival but the police intervened in time to quell the protests. Upon Raila's arrival, chaos erupted again after Treasury CS Ukur Yattani was given a chance to address the crowds. The crowd started heckling at the CS, demanding money. Police had to intervene to restore order with the organizers resolving to allow only Raila, Karua and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to address the crowds. All the local leaders were forced to sit back to prevent a repeat of the situation. Raila promised the pastoralist community that his government would introduce livestock insurance to benefit them. He also promised single parents that he would take care of them by introducing social protection funds. On Monday, IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati urged Kenyans and leaders to shun violent behaviours ahead of the August polls. Chebukati also reminded aspirants, their supporters, political parties,  and the Government to observe peace during the electioneering period. "All Kenyans have a duty to adhere to the Electoral Code of conduct and shun violence, intimidation and reprisals that may comprise the conduct of free, fair and peaceful election," he said. Chebukati pointed out that these acts may jeopardize the security of the country.
