Meru Woman Representative Kawira Mwangaza has established a community-based rescue centre to save people affected by gender-based violence incidences. The Sh50million Meru Mwangaza Rescue and Resource Centre built from scratch through National Government Affirmative Action funds will be used to rehabilitate, instil skills and save those affected gender violence. The facility, which is built at Nkomo in Tigania West, is one of its kind where those rehabilitated, according to Kawira, will acquire skills to help them rebuild their lives. Gender and Public Service CS Margret Kobia said the GBV centre is a milestone and will help transform society. “We agreed to support the project by opening up a road and also connected electricity.” Kawira urged Meru county commissioner Fred Ndunga to offer adequate security to all aspiring women to curb harassment during their campaign meetings. She said under her tenure, at least 17,000 people have benefited from empowerment funds from her Okolea Kaana Ka Meru initiative. Kawira is vying for Meru governor on as independent candidate. Last month, Meru women leaders castigated police over harassment, threats and inequality in protecting them compared to their male counterparts. North Imenti MP candidate Beatrice Karwitha said she is a victim of intimidation and was thrown out of meetings by police officers. Karwitha spoke on behalf of the women seeking political seats. Njuri Ncheke Council of Elders secretary general Josphat Murangiri said people should not despise or leave their culture due to political differences. He said GBV has affected the norms of the Ameru people to live in peace.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
