The DCI has flagged as fake a document circulating online containing names of men purportedly arrested while undergoing militia training in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu county. The document shared online claimed that 25 men had been arrested while undergoing the training at Chebororwa Agricultural Training. It was dated June 13, 2022 and signed by one Mwenda Meme. DCI boss George Kinoti said in a tweet on Tuesday that the document did not originate from his office or any office associated with the DCI headquarters. "You are advised to treat it with the contempt it deserves," he said. Detectives based at the Forensic Cybercrime unit have launched investigations to determine the source of the document and prosecute its authors.
