Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu has lauded the Directorate of Criminal Investigations over their work in combating crime in the city and across the country. Speaking in Nyeri during the surprise birthday party for Archbishop Anthony Muheria, Kananu said several gangs have been dismantled with many members arrested and prosecuted. “Let’s compliment the DCI. They have actually done some tremendous work. Several criminal gang members are now languishing in prison because of their wrong doings,” she said. The governor called on detectives to make good use of the newly opened forensic laboratory to combat high tech crimes. “President Uhuru Kenyatta recently opened a state-of-the-art facility for the DCI. Please make him a happy man. Those are some of his legacies that generations to come will be celebrating him for." Governor Kananu also asked religious leaders to pray for the nation as it heads towards the general elections on August 9. DCI boss George Kinoti appreciated his officers, adding that he will work to ensure that the newly opened state-of-the-art forensic laboratory benefits the people. He said with the backing of prayers from spiritual leaders, detectives will ensure Kenyans from all walks of life are safe. Archbishop Muheria said people find great peace and love in Godly acts and the Church will continue praying for the nation. He exuded confidence that the August general elections will be peaceful. “Prayers are key to everything. We must involve God in every situation especially now that we are heading into the general elections. I ask all leaders to turn to God for guidance and protection,” he said. The director of the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau Paul Mumo, the deputy director of forensics Margaret Karanja and Central Regional Police boss Manasseh Musyoka were among senior security officials who had accompanied Kinoti to the function..
