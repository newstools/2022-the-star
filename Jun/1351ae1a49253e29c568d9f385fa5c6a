Kenya Kwanza leaders  on Tuesday told the government to stop instilling fear in Kenyans through profiling some counties as poll violence hotspots. Kenya Kwanza presidential running mate Rigathi Gachagua, Kakamega Senator Moses Wetang'ula and Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot said Kenyans are now more enlightened and would not resort to violence as it happened during in 2007-08. The leaders said it is the government's responsibility to provide security to all parts of the country without profiling some counties as hotspots. Speaking at a development forum at Kericho Green stadium, Gachagua termed as scare claims by Nation Cohesion and Integration Commission that violence was likely to occur in some counties in August. Gachagua, who was hosted by Senator Cheruiyot, said the government has all the machine at its disposal to fix any form of political violence without going public to suggest some areas will be rocked by chaos. Cheruiyot asked the state to de-linked Kericho from being one of the six hot spot counties. "We are not happy with the NCIC for profiling Kericho as one of hotspots in Kenya," the senator said. Gachagua assured Kericho residents and Kenyans at large that Kenya Kwanza was committed to fulfilling all promises after ascending to power. He said they will keep their word unlike the case where Deputy President William Ruto was promised support after President Uhuru Kenyatta's term of office. The Mathira MP told Kenyans to elect Ruto as Kenya's fifth president and him as his running for five years and thereafter give them a second term after fulfilling all the promises they have pledged to implement. He said Kenya was not ready for Raila Odinga to lead them. "He has outlived his usefulness and  cannot give this county the kind of leadership it deserves,"Gachagua said.
