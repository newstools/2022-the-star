Deputy President William Ruto has arrived at the historic Tononoka grounds in Mombasa where he is expected to lead the Kenya Kwanza brigade for a political rally dubbed 'Ukombozi Rally'. Ruto was accompanied by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, among a host of UDA aspirants led by Mombasa governor candidate Hassan Omar. The rally was delayed for almost an hour because there were only hundreds of UDA supporters at the grounds. The rally was scheduled to start at 2 pm, but by 3:30 pm the rally was yet to begin because of the low attendance. The DP who was in Kwale in the morning for an economic forum, had by 2:30 pm crossed the Likoni ferry channel to head to the grounds. But his convoy was seen re-routing to an undisclosed location where sources close to the UDA camp in Mombasa said that they had been called for a meeting. Earlier, Deputy President William Ruto had gifted four schools in Mombasa County with school buses. The schools are Mohamed Ali Girls Secondary School, Kongowea Secondary School, Frere Town Secondary School and Khadija Secondary School in Nyali Constituency. The DP said Kenya Kwanza associates with area MP Mohamed Ali for his commitment and continued role in enhancing access to quality education in Nyali through the NG-CDF. "We pledge to channel more funds to the grassroots to further our country’s development," Ruto said.
