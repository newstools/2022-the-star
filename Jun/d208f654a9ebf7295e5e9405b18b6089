The proceedings at the IEBC Dispute Resolution Tribunal have brought to fore serious issues about the place of degrees in our governance system. In our case, the degree requirement for the position of governor and president is a matter of law and as a country of laws, it is important that we all respect the law. While some believe that leadership is God-given, it takes more than passion and vision to become an effective leader in the world of today. Truly great leaders also possess a mindset, specific skills and the ability to navigate a business setting. If one feels that they have a talent, that’s a great start but they need to learn how to hone their skills, strategise a business plan, manage a team and inspire real change. Effective leadership is highly circumstantial. Leaders need different knowledge and skills in different situations. Leaders can’t change their personality on demand, but they can change their behaviours – and that requires learned skills. Many leaders have corrupted their way into office. Government institutions involved should be praised for trying to stop this habit. Let all those interested in positions that require degrees make time to go to school and earn them in the right way.
