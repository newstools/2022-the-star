Athletes based in Iten will this Friday conduct prayers following incidences that have put the athletics training hub in bad light recently. Iten, a small town but the headquarters of Elgeyo Marakwet County, attained the World Athletics Heritage Status with a Plaque in 2020, but there are fears this prestige is slowly waning after cases of murder meted on athletes. The murders of former world cross country champion Agnes Tirop and Kenyan-born Bahraini Damaris Mutua, the organisers said, have put the region — rated as one of the best training bases in the world— in unwarranted negativity. Retired runner Nahashon Kibon is among the active and former athletes who have decided to set up the prayer meeting in a move aimed at not only mentoring their peers but help 'cleanse' the town. Kibon said that need spiritual nourishment to prosper to go hand in hand with the glory they achieve in track and field and the roads. “Athletes usually miss spiritual nourishment and this is the best opportunity to impart such knowledge,” said Kibon. “We want to make this prayer summit a monthly event. We want it to help restore our athletes spiritually.”
