The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is for the second day holding a consultative meeting with the Kenya media sector. The main objective of the meeting is to strengthen media participation in electoral matters, especially on election results management ahead of the general elections. IEBC boss Chebukati said the lifetime of the electoral Code of Conduct runs from when IEBC publishes the General Election date. He added the general elections Code came into effect on January 20, 2022, and it runs up to the day elected leaders are sworn into office. Chebukati further said the State, politicians, and media have a duty to adhere to the Election Code of Conduct. "Candidates and political parties are required to promote voter education in campaigns, condemn violence, intimidation in political rallies, promote ethnic tolerance and avoid hate speech," Chebukati said. "Candidates, their agents and political parties are required to respect the role media plays during and after elections." Chebukati also emphasised that candidates and political parties are required not to prevent media from accessing rallies, meetings, and demonstrations. "Under the Election Code of Conduct, candidates and political parties are required to take reasonable steps to ensure media and journalists are not subjected to harassment or intimidation as they cover their electoral events," Chebukati said.
