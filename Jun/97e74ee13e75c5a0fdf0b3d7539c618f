The second edition of PlayBack is happening over the weekend at the Carnivore Simba Saloon. Dubbed 'The Sound of Our Generation', the show is a hits journal from the 80s to current music. Speaking to Word Is, the organisers said all music will be played. "From the selection of DJs to the entire night schedule, the audience will reminisce on the music of their age, making it a perfect event for reunions." Popular DJ Pinye will be on the decks with other legends like DJ Babs, D-Lite, Gichboy, John Rabar, Stretch, Ely & Mix Master Lenny representing the music you’ve danced to from the eighties to the current all on one dance floor. Gates open from 4pm and tickets are available on Tickets Playback.
