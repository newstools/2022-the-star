Deputy President William Ruto returns to Western this weekend on his vote hunt mission as the August polls draw near. Ruto will address rallies at Kidundu stadium in Vihiga County and Boma grounds in Mumias in the morning before addressing other rallies at Mayuba stadium in Sirisia constituency and Muliro Gardens in Webuye in Bungoma county. Ruto’s visit to the vote-rich region comes less than a week after he addressed a massive campaign rally at Bukhungu stadium in Kakamega town last Sunday. The rally at Bukhungu was preceded by a week-long campaign by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Bungoma senator Moses Wetang’ula in the region where they explained to supporters what their 30 percent share of government promises to Luhyas by Kenya Kwanza means. Ruto will be accompanied by Mudavadi and Wetang’ula. The tour come amid reports that Azimio One Kenyan presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga is to head to Western after his week-long tour of Eastern Kenya. During his tour of Western three weeks ago, Raila visited Vihiga, Buses, Bungoma and Trans-Nzoia and skipped Kakamega county. The DP is keen to cement the gains he has so far made in the region, according to Kakamega Kenya Kwanza governor candidate Cleophas Malala. The restive campaigns in the region by the DP underscores the importance he attaches to the Western vote bloc. Both Kenya Kwanza and Azimio One Kenya camps are fighting tooth and nail to control the over 2.5m votes in the region.
