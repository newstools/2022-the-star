The High court has reinstated the Sh300,000 cash bail of former Rugby player Alex Olaba. Justice Grace Nzioka on Friday said the review application by Olaba's lawyer on the cancellation of the bond terms was allowed. While reinstating the bond, the judge found that there was no formal application for cancellation of the bond by the prosecution. "There was no formal application and no affidavit that was filed by the Investigating officer to prove the allegations of interference with witnesses," Justice Nzioka said. She added that the prosecutors only gave evidence from the bar. Last year, a Chief Magistrate’s Court cancelled Olaba's bond terms after the prosecution said he had committed an offence of conspiracy to murder while facing the gang-rape charge. Trial Magistrate Zainab Abdul said the accused committed the offence while he was out on bond and proceeded to threaten the complainant in the case. Zainab ruled that Olaba was to remain in custody until his two cases are heard and determined. The former Kenya Sevens and Kenya Harlequins players were arrested last year for allegedly trying to hatch a plot to kill witnesses in the gang-rape case. He has since denied the charges of conspiracy to commit the murder of a witness. Olaba was previously charged with Frank Wanyama with an offence of gang rape in 2019. They had been found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in jail. They however appealed against the sentence and the same was quashed by the High Court on a technicality. The duo was, however, later arrested in 2020 and charged afresh.
