Kenya Kwanza Presidential candidate William Ruto on Thursday took a swipe at the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai labelling him as "incompetent" He spoke during a meeting with the delegation of the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) at Karen. While addressing the group, the DP cast doubt on the command of the police ahead of the polls. He said the IG is being controlled externally instead of acting independently as required by the constitution. "We doubt the command. We have a serious problem with the command of the police. We have the most incompetent Inspector General of the Police," he said. "In fact, the current IG is the president of Kenya (Uhuru Kenyatta), who is the leader of Azimio." Ruto however claimed that the IG's incompetence may not be manifested when situations are working out well. He added that Mutyambai's inability to make decisions was prompted by him not being in any capacity to do so. "The current command of the police is done by others. The IG is supposed to be an independent office. But if he cannot discharge that possibility it means he is being discharged by people who don't run independent office." The UDA presidential candidate however said their concerns do not extend to the force. He said they have doubts if the police will be able to diligently perform their task ahead of the polls. "The only concern from where we sit is the police. We do not doubt the capacity of the police to handle the situation; overseeing the August 9, general elections." The group had met to discuss the Pre-Election Assessment Mission ahead of the elections. It was led by the Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan.
