Kune food, a Nairobi-based food tech startup has shut its doors to the public today. The company is widely known for producing and distributing quality takeaway meals at an affordable price for individuals, retailers, and corporate. The startup was hoping to expand it operations beyond Nairobi at least by 2024. The news was announced by the startup’s founder and CEO, Robin Reecht, through a LinkedIn post. It is reported that the founder had called an impromptu meeting with the company’s employees and told them that the startup had run out of money after an investor pulled out. “Since the beginning of the year, we sold more than 55,000 meals, acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers. But at $3 per meal, it just wasn’t enough to sustain our growth … Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn’t keep going,” he wrote in the post. “With the current economic downturn and investment market tightening up and rising food cost, we just could not keep going,” “ My first thoughts go to the team. You put your heart and soul into building Kune that so many people loved. I’m deeply sorry it did not work out.”
