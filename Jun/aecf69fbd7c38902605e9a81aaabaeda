Campaigns in Nairobi are expected to reach tempo pitch in the coming days as the two leading political factions intensify campaigns ahead of the polls. Nairobi Governor Ann Kananu will lead the charm offensive for the Azimio la Umoja camp after the mandate was bestowed upon her by presidential aspirant Raila Odinga. The governor has since confirmed that she will convene a meeting of all Azimio candidates before hitting the ground with non-stop rallies. "It is now time to hit the ground proper and knock on each door in all our wards because Baba has to win and we have no room for excuses," Kananu said. She will be helped by the President of Kenya Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Richard Ngatia to champion campaigns targeting traders and business people. The duo has specifically been mandated to ensure gubernatorial candidate Polycarp Igathe and running mate Philip Kaloki win the contest against their Kenya Kwanza opponents. The Azimio team faces UDA's Johnson Sakaja, the current Nairobi senator, and his running mate George Muchiri. The contest between the rival camps is expected to be tough and rigorous as Nairobi, considered the centre of power, is a crucial county that presidential candidates are eager to win. Nairobi hosts all the ministries' headquarters, all diplomatic missions and is a vital transit spot for majority of the airlines flying in and out of Africa. A cosmopolitan county, Nairobi is believed to host all the 42 communities in the country and is among the richest counties in Kenya. Kananu said her target is to ensure Raila gets more than two million votes in the county which has about 2.5 million registered voters.
