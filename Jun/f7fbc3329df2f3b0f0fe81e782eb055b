Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has been denied clearance to vie for the Mombasa governor seat. The electoral agency cited his impeachment while serving as Nairobi Governor as the reason why he was not cleared to vie. At the same time, IEBC notified the governor that he could not be cleared since his degree had not been certified by the Commission of University Education. On the High Court ruling that lifted the order barring the IEBC from clearing the Governor, IEBC argued that the court did not direct them to clear Sonko. The order had indicated that Sonko's clearance was at the discretion of the electoral body. The denial caused a standoff at the IEBC offices as the governor tried to negotiate his way to be cleared. The aspiring governor had arrived at the Kenya School of Government (KSG) for clearance by IEBC. Sonko is eyeing the Mombasa governor seat on the Wiper Party ticket. He was accompanied by his running mate Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo, former Matuga MP Chirau Mwakwere. On Saturday, IEBC had disqualified Sonko from contesting in the Mombasa governor race. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said the impeached Nairobi Governor was not fit to run for the seat in the August polls. He said the Commission received a report from the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission that listed one governor aspirant, one senatorial aspirant and one Member of the County Assembly aspirant as unfit to hold public office following their impeachment. But Sonko claimed that the Kenyan Constitution does not explicitly state that aspirants with any pending court cases are barred from vying for elective seats. More to follow...
