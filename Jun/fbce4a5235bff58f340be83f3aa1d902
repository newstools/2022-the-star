Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Cook the penne in salted water until soft. Then reserve ½ cup of pasta before draining pasta and return the sufuria to heat. Step 2 Add butter to another sufuria and melt over medium heat. Then add chopped garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Step 3 Add flour to the butter and whisk to combine. Let cook for 1 minute until fragrant and lightly browned. Step 4 Add milk a little at a time, whisking constantly to work out any lumps. Milk will thicken up quickly at the beginning, but as you whisk the rest of the milk in it will loosen the sauce. Step 5 Cook the sauce, whisking occasionally until thickened, about 6 minutes before adding chicken, spinach, and cream cheese. Stir until cheese has melted. Step 6 Turn off the heat and stir in parmesan cheese. Add the pre-boiled pasta to the sauce and stir to combine. Step 7 Stir in the reserved pasta water tablespoons at a time until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Step 8 Taste then add salt and pepper to taste and serve with a cold beverage.
