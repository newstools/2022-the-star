Machakos gubernatorial aspirant Wavinya Ndeti on Wednesday recognized Kamba freedom fighters as Kenya marked its 59th Madaraka Day. Ndeti said legendries Paul Ngei, Mulu Mutisya, Syokimau and her grandfather Muindi Mbigu couldn’t be forgotten as the country celebrates the day of remembering their contribution to the nation’s independence. She said the four were among other legendaries from other parts of the country who joined hands to ensure Kenya got her independence in 1963. “We recognize Paul Ngei, my grandfather Muindi Mbingu, Mulu Mutisya and Syokimau. Those who represented us as a Kamba community. They united with legendaries from other communities for Kenya to get her independence hence the importance to recognize them,” Ndeti said. The former Transport CAS spoke during the day’s celebrations at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos County on Wednesday, June 1. The national event was graced by Machakos County Commissioner Rhoda Onyancha flanked by a county security team headed by police boss Issa Mohammud. She said Kamba was a peaceful community and lauded the security apparatus for ensuring heightened security in Machakos County. “Madam Commissioner, welcome to Machakos County. We are very happy to have a female county commissioner. You aren’t just a woman, but a leader. We thank God for that and welcome you here,” Ndeti said. This was Onyancha’s first national public function to preside over since she was posted to Machakos from Taita Taveta County months ago. She also took the opportunity to praise President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee administration for doing a great job, especially in infrastructure development.
