Thirdway Alliance party leader Ekuru Aukot says he will challenge Raila Odinga's clearance by IEBC to run for presidency. Aukot made the remarks shortly after the Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission disqualified him from the August 9 presidential contest. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said he failed to submit signatures and copies of national identity cards of 48,000 registered voters who endorsed his presidential bid. Aukot said he will challenge the ID and signatures requirement for presidential aspirants as well as Raila's candidature at the polls. "Odinga has been sponsored by the State, hence the use of government resources in financing his bid," Aukot said. He said he will file the petition at the High Court on Monday, June 6. This would not be the first time Aukot is trying to scuttle Raila's political ambitions. In April this year, he wanted to block the Azimio flagbearer from the presidential race on grounds that he is still a public servant. In a joint petition with his Thirdway Alliance chairman Miruru Waweru, the duo argued that Raila is a lifetime public servant and cannot resign to run for elective posts as other public officers. They argued that in 2015, Parliament enacted the Retirement Benefits (Deputy President and Designated State Officers) Act which created specific public offices obligating the entitled persons to serve as public officers.
