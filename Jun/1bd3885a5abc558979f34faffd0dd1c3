Families in Embu county have received healthy nutrition awareness training from the health department. The event that was held at Riandu dispensary in Mbeere North subcounty was graced by the Embu Health executive John Mukundi who was also the event's chief guest. The training mainly targeted expectant and lactating  mothers and infant nutrition for healthy childhood development. Mukundi said healthy nutrition is important in ensuring successful parenting. He said that the consumption of iron and required folic supplements by expectant mothers within the Riandu locality is below 50 per cent hence making it a centre of interest for the health department. Further, Mukundi said that the nutrition knowledge in the area is below 10 per cent. The executive also said his department has several initiatives to uplift the nutrition and routine health among the children below five years. "We have been having immunisation, deworming, uptake of vitamin A supplements, health and nutrition education among other initiatives through our various networks and our facility-based delivery,"  Mukundi said. Embu county medical services director Stephen Kaniaru said the health department is committed to ensuring an improved nutrition for the residents. He said that breastfeeding comes as one of the top agendas and encouraged exclusive first six months of breastfeeding to help raise healthy children. "Exclusive breastfeeding is amongst our main areas of insistence to ensure proper children development and growth," Kaniaru said. According to Unicef, expectant mothers need nutritious and safe diets to establish sufficient reserves for pregnancy. Further, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, mothers require increased energy and nutrients, which help in ensuring their health and that of their children are protected throughout their pregnancy period.
