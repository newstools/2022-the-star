Three suspects were Tuesday night killed in a botched robbery incident in Ruai, Nairobi. According to police and witnesses, the men, who were riding on a motorcycle, had snatched a bag from a female pedestrian. The victim, whom they had hit in the head and had sustained a deep cut, raised the alarm and the men tried to escape using the motorcycle but they landed in a ditch. They then tried to escape on foot but members of the public and police responded to the victim's call for help. Police said one of the suspects was shot and killed while two others were lynched by a mob after a dramatic chase. Police say they recovered two homemade pistols from them. This is the latest such incident to happen in the city as police rush to contain rising violent crimes. Elsewhere, police are looking for a gang of three who attacked and raped a woman at her house in Kangemi, Nairobi. They tied the woman's legs and hands. The 21-year-old woman told police the men who attacked her wore balaclavas to hide their identities and she is yet to know the motive of the incident. She was rescued and taken to hospital where she is being attended to. Police handling the incident said they have yet to establish the motive. Meanwhile, police are investigating an incident in which a man was found with a firearm long after his permit had been withdrawn in Nairobi’s Spring Valley area. The victim was disarmed and had his permit cancelled in February this year, but on Tuesday he was found with another Taurus pistol with 32 bullets. The man was disarmed after he misused his weapon by shooting in the air 12 times unprovoked. Neighbours called police who took away the pistol. Police said they are investigating the matter with the intention of taking action. Licensed gun holders go through a rigorous process to get permits for their weapons. Edited by A.N
