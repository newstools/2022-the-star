Safina presidential hopeful Jimi Wanjigi has said he will exploit all legal avenues and ensure he will be on the ballot for the August 9 polls. Speaking Monday after he was denied clearance by IEBC at the Bomas of Kenya, Wanjigi blamed chairman Wafula Chebukati of applying double standards in clearing candidates. "We know what is going on, and unfortunately this time you will not get away with it," Wanjigi said. "There seems to be a very clear decision that there are people who are not supposed to be on the ballot, and I'm one of them," he added. Chebukati switched off the microphone when Wanjigi amplified his protests following the decision to deny him clearance. "Please address your supporters from outside," Chebukati said firmly. The electoral body boss told Wanjigi he submitted insufficient signatures of his supports, short of one county. He also failed to submit a physical copy of his university degree. Presidential candidates were required to submit signatures of supporters who have endorsed their presidential bids from 24 majority counties. Wanjigi submitted signatures of supporters from 23 counties. Chebukati told him he still had a leeway to be cleared if he presented the requisite documents on time. "We have allowed others who have problems with signatures to harmonise, and we can also allow you in the remaining hours to do so," Chebukati said. But Wanjigi read malice in the commission's decision and vowed to use legal means to ensure he runs for the presidency. He said he will pursue justice using the dispute resolution methodology and head to court. "I will be on the ballot not withstanding the shenanigans you are seeing here. We shall vaccinate this IEBC in totality," he said.
