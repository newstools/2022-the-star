Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali believes his development record and firm leadership will aid him in defending his seat in August polls Mohamud said his love for the community, passion, welfare and  development in the county are some of the reasons residents will re-elect him. "I believe my firm leadership helped achieve the development milestones that shaped the county," Mohamud said in Sagante jaldesa ward. He said when he took over the county was experiencing insecurity that resulted to loss of lives and property. However, he managed to fortify the security architecture through community's dialogue to prevent further bloodshed. Mohamud said he did healthcare reform, improved water shortages and education to improve people's livelihoods. On water scarcity, Mohamud said his administration sunk 150 boreholes and bought 6 water bowsers. He urged the residents to vote wisely for the sake of development, saying  his competitors had nothing tangible to offer. "My development record is self explanatory from roads, health, education and water provision," he said He urged residents to give each political candidate a chance to sell their  manifestos and maintain peace during campaigns. He said his meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta yielded fruits as the county will now get four subcounties. Mohamud bid also got a boost after he received defectors from his 2017 rivals — Deputy Governor Hassan Marsa, former women representative Nasra Ibren and former Moyale MP Roba Duba.
