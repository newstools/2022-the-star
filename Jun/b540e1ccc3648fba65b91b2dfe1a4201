APS Bomet are all set for a titanic top of the table clash against Fortune Sacco at Kianyaga Stadium this afternoon, as the National Super League (NSL) fixtures enter Round 30 this weekend. Fortune are three points adrift of APS, with Naivas, Muhoroni Youth and Kibera Black Stars falling behind in that order. The Kirinyaga-based lads must step on the gas pedal to widen the gap on third-placed Muhoroni Youth. Muhoroni have been impressive this season and their emphatic 4-2 and 3-0 wins over Coastal Heroes and Murang’a Seal highlight their intentions to reclaim their position in top-flight football. Meanwhile, Coastal Heroes have been sent packing from the country's second tier after they failed to honour three fixtures. A letter from Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Transition Committee head of secretariat, Lindah Ogutu, stated that the club had been relegated in line with Rule 3.1.12 after failing to honour matches against Shabana, Vihiga United and Mwatate United.
