A jury has found disgraced actor Bill Cosby sexually abused a 16-year-old girl at the Playboy Mansion in 1975, awarding the victim $500,000. Less than a year ago, Cosby walked free from prison after his sexual assault conviction was thrown out. More than 50 women have come forward with abuse allegations against the man once known as America's Dad, charges he denies.
