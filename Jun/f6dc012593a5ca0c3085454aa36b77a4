People living with disability (PLWD) in Bungoma County are now pleading with residents to consider electing them saying they have been neglected for many years. Speaking on Monday at Kanduyi market during a rally, Yonah Kisaka, a person living with a disability and an MCA aspirant in the Township ward in the Kanduyi constituency, noted that PLWD have been neglected for a long time. “Some people see us as nobody and think that PLWD cannot serve in public offices. I want to tell you that I am able to do the task and if given that office to run, I will do so with a lot of diligence,” Kisaka said. Kisaka pointed out that he joined politics so that he can be part of the negotiation table. This, he said, will enable PLWD and the youths to be included in the resource sharing and allocation. “If you elect me to represent you at the county assembly of Bungoma I won’t fail you in any way. I will ensure that I push for the agenda of PLWD and the youth,” he said. Kisaka urged political parties to consider supporting PLWD to reach their dreams in politics rather than limiting them. “Before I moved to independent I was in the Jubilee party. But when time came for party primaries, I was left hanging and the party ticket was given to someone else,” Kisaka said. "I have an ambition of becoming a top politician in the country. Denying me a ticket won’t kill my dream, I will go as an independent candidate up to the ballot.” Kisaka pledged to work with the governor who will be elected to ensure residents are enjoying the fruits of devolution. He also said, if elected, he will also present serious bills before the county assembly that will help residents. In his appeal, Kisaka urged electorates to vote for youthful aspirants to take leadership roles. “When we were in school they used to tell us that our time to lead will come and it has now come, lets's support young people to ascend to elective positions,” he said.
