Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has warned the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya alliance of dire consequences if the ongoing infightings are not tamed. The former governor, who is fighting to be on the ballot as a Mombasa governor candidate on a Wiper party ticket, raised concerns over sibling rivalry in the Azimio coalition saying it risks its success in the coming polls. He challenged parties making up the Azimio coalition to cease fire and focus on hunting votes for the Azimio coalition. "Hapa Azimio people are busy fighting one another rather than looking for Baba's votes. Wale viongozi hawawezi leta kura mingi are busy fighting people who can help," Sonko captioned a video he shared on his Facebook post on Monday. "Write it up somewhere, my little experience I have in politics for the last 15 years, this desire for money which started from the party nominations to selective application of the Constitution when clearing candidates will very soon cause a lot of damage." In the video, Sonko shared, United Democratic Forum leader Cyrus Jirongo was expressing his reservation about plans to have some aspirants step down for others. Speaking at Pan Paper Stadium in Kakamega on Sunday, Jirongo said the Coalition leader Raila Odinga should not dictate his bid. "We will give him (Raila) votes for the presidency. I don't want him to help me in my governor bid. I don't need him to help me. His people are in Nyanza. He can't come to our kitchen. Respect us," he said. "We will give him the president's vote. All the other votes here (in Kakamega) will be for our party members." Azimio coalition last week revealed its plan to have some of its aspirants step down to avoid dividing votes to the advantage of their opponents. The proposal has attracted criticism from some players who are not willing to quit their ambitions.
