Nakuru senator Susan Kihika has been cleared to run for Nakuru governor's seat. The senator together with her running mate David Kones presented their papers for clearance to the Nakuru IEBC returning Officer Dr Eroo Mele accompanied by their supporters. The jubilant Kihika said she has been overwhelmed by the love the people of Nakuru have shown her adding that she is ready to address the problems facing the county. "I want to thank everyone for the love and also to my party the UDA which nominated us even without going to the ballot. They believed in us that much," Kihika said. "Am thankful to God, to family to supporters and to friends. It is a high moment but also the beginning of a journey. As candidates, we now carry the aspirations and hopes of the people wanting to see a better Nakuru," she added. The firebrand Senator Kihika says her first priority if she is elected the third Nakuru governor will be the provision of clean water. According to her, the issue of water has been neglected by the previous and incumbent male governors but it holds a special place in her agenda. "We have talked with our party leader who is our presidential candidate William Ruto because we know we will win. The Chemasus dam in Baringo county will give water to some areas in Nakuru county." Kihika stated. Itare dam will also be the first priority of the Kenya Kwanza government with Kihika promising that Kenya kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has promised to complete the dam if he is elected to office. The dam which is in Kuresoi North, Nakuru county was abruptly stopped after the company which had been contracted to build the dam filed for bankruptcy. Kihika also exuded confidence that Nakuru might be among the first county to produce all women elected leaders in the county leadership.
