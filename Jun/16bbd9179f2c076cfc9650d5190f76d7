Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua has warned  Kenyans against voting for leaders that have been disrespectful towards President Uhuru Kenyatta. Speaking during a campaign rally at Gatanga on Friday, Karua said it was wrong for leaders to insult the President, urging the residents to shun such behaviours. "Mimi sijasema usikosoe. Ata kama ni rais kosoa. Lakini ukosoe kwa heshima na kwa misingi ya sababu za kutosha," she said. This loosely translates to, "I have not said you should not correct the leaders. Do it even if it is the president. But correct them with respect and under the foundation of reasonable terms." The Narc leader, in what was seemingly a remark directed to Kenya Kwanza leader William Ruto, said if one is a deputy, they should remain in the ranks of their duty. "Even when I was under the leadership of the former President Mwai Kibaki, I never disrespected him. I walked away with the respect he had bestowed me," she added. Karua urged parents not to condone disrespect and also to teach their children about the virtue of respect. "Who among you parents would allow their children to disrespect them? Respect is a virtue." She added that she and her colleagues in the Coalition have cultivated respect for each other and themselves,  and that should be replicated in other parties. On occasions, the Deputy President has been accused of disrespecting his boss, but the DP has always defended himself, saying he respects Uhuru.
