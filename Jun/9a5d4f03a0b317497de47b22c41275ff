Detectives on Thursday arrested five suspects they busted with narcotic substances. Sleuths drawn from the Anti-narcotics Unit based at DCI headquarters nabbed the suspects at an apartment within Nyayo Estate in Embakasi, Nairobi. "After a detailed search in the apartment, several items were recovered including 240 pellets of unknown substances believed to be narcotic drugs, five mobile phones, a laptop and travel documents," DCI said. "A motor vehicle make Toyota Mark X with a Burundian registration number plate was also impounded." The suspects, two foreigners of South African origin and three Kenyans, are believed to be part of a transnational drug trafficking syndicate. The five suspects who were being detained at the Muthaiga police station, were arraigned at a city court Friday where detectives sought extension of custodial orders to facilitate further interrogation into their criminal enterprise. All the exhibits have since been dispatched for forensic analysis at the Chemistry and Toxicological lab, based at the recently commissioned DCI National Forensic Laboratory. Cases of narcotics trafficking and consumption have been on the rise in the past years amid persistent operations by officials to tame the same. In 2019, the then European Union Ambassador to Kenya Simon Mordue said the Kenyan port of Mombasa accounted for 30 per cent of illegal heroin smuggled into the EU market. The revelations were not new to some government officials who know the trend of the business. Most of the heroin in the country originates from Afghanistan through the Indian Ocean while cocaine originates from South America. Kenyan security agencies seized the second-biggest haul of cocaine weighing 100 kilos and valued at Sh598 million in 2016 in Mombasa that was disguised as sugar. The case was however later dismissed in court.
