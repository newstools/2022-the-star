Rapper Khaligraph Jones' baby mama, Cashy Karimi is accusing the singer of being a deadbeat. Cashy on Instagram disagreed with Khaligraph's wife Georgina Muteti, who said he is the 'best dad ever'. Georgina wrote, "You're the best dad and we're so blessed to have you." Cashy also denied wrecking the rapper's marriage, saying her son is older than Georgina's first child. The dispute between Cashy and Jones goes way back after they broke up in 2018. In 2020, Cashy served the rapper with a demand letter, which she felt he didn't take seriously. She then claimed her baby daddy was seeking custody of their son, whom he "had no prior concern for". When contacted by Word Is, Khaligraph was not ready to address the allegations.
