Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has said he has not stopped using riddles in charming his political supporters during campaign rallies. Raila who has been christened Mr Kitendawili, a Swahili translation of the word 'riddle', said he has only reduced the frequency of using the art of speech to pass a message to his supporters. "I have not stopped doing the kitendawili, I just don’t do it as often as before. Sometimes I use it when I want to bring the point home. It is not that I stopped using it because some people nicknamed me Mr Kitendawili," he said. He spoke on Tuesday during a media conference in Karen. While explaining his recent use of the phrase 'Hayaa', 'Hayaa', the ODM leader said he has found the phrase more conducive to stimulating the crowd before issuing his address. Raila's use of riddles while addressing his supporters made him a popular political figure as he skillfully deployed them in explaining complex issues of governance. He also used the riddle to attack his opponent and even entertain the masses to break the monotony of political speeches. On August 2, 2017, Mama Ida Odinga said the use of vitendawili helped Raila to draw the people closer to him. "Every time you say kitendawili people pay attention, they want to hear what is coming next. But if you're just giving lectures and warning people that is not leadership. People get scared of you. Look at the lighter side of life."
