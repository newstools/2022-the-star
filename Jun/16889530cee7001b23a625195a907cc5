Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali's campaigns got a boost on Wednesday after women from Sololo declared support for his reelection bid. Organisers of the team Qabale Duba promised to visit every village to drum up support for the governor and his coalition partner and asked all women to join them in making the dream a reality on August 9. Youth leader Qala Shedo said Governor Mohamud's love for the community and his development record are some of the reasons they want him to be reelected. He said the governor's determination to take development in the county by equalising ward development funds and his efforts to improve healthcare were commendable, adding services are now closer to the people. "Our people suffering from kidney problems used to travel to other counties seeking treatment but the presence of a kidney dialysis machine has reduced the expenses incurred by the patients because the services are now available in the county," Shedo said. Community elder Galm Dabaso confirmed their unflinching support for the governor and his team, saying he has made giant strides in the sectors of health, education and infrastructure. He further said most of Mohamud's initiatives are people-oriented programmes aimed at improving the living standards. Dabaso added the governor's scholarship programme has benefited hundreds of needy students and that the National Hospital Insurance Card are some of the projects directly assisting needy people in the county. Mzee Jarso, a resident of Sololo, commended Governor Mohamud's administration for its development, describing it as unprecedented and revolutionary. He urged all the candidates vying for different seat to conduct peaceful campaigns.  (edited by Amol Awuor
