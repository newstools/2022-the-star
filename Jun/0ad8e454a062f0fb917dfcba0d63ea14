Youths in Kajiado were last week taken through a peace sensitization programme ahead of the August 9 General Election. The exercise focused on informing the youngsters on how to counter election violence and political intolerance in Kajiado county. The sensitization was supported by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission of Kenya (NCIC) and the Kajiado North subcounty election preparedness committee dialogue. The youth were taught the importance of peaceful co-existence in Kajiado County during the 2022 electioneering period. Those present pledged to adhere to the Constitution of Kenya, practice and advocate for political decency, use of the language of peace and exclusivity, respect and cultural sensitivity in public and private spaces. They also pledged not to engage in hate speech or insults on behalf of politicians and their cohorts. The event took place at Citam Church in Ngong.
