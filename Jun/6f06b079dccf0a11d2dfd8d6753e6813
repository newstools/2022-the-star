Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga says he will willing accept defeat should he lose the August 9 polls. The ODM leader who will be making his fifth, and seemingly his last stab at the presidency at the general election is facing stiff competition from Deputy President William Ruto of UDA. "Definitely, I'm the sportsman between me and him and I know that asiyekubali kushindwa sio mshindani," Raila said. (He who doesn't concede defeat is not a sportsman). "So I will easily accept defeat and congratulate the winner," Raila added. He spoke Tuesday night during a media interview in Karen together with running mate Martha Karua. Ruto has on numerous occasions taunted Raila and challenged him to openly declare that he will accept election results should he lose the August duel. Raila has thrice disputed presidential election results during the 2007, 2013 and 2017 editions claiming he beat his competitors. The 2007 debacle led to the formation of a grand coalition government with the late President Mwai Kibaki after the standoff degenerated into a bloody affair between supporters of the two leaders. Raila was then made the prime minister in a power-sharing deal midwifed by former UN boss, the late Kofi Annan. The Supreme Court dismissed Raila's petition after the 2013 polls but the apex court overturned President Uhuru Kenyatta's win in the 2017 contest. Uhuru easily won the re-run after Raila boycotted the repeat contest claiming the issues that led to the nullification of the first election, including unverifiable results transmission, had not been fixed.
