Kenya Kwanza on Friday started a three-day campaign tour in the Coast region. UDA presidential candidate William Ruto led the campaign team in Taita Taveta County. They made stops at Wundanyi and Kajire areas. Ruto said the years lost in trying to review the Constitution is the reason millions of Kenyans are suffering due to the high cost of living and unemployment. "We must reverse this trend by electing a responsible Government that will prioritize people-centred issues," he added. Present were MCC leader Alfred Mutua, Kwale County Governor Salim Mvurya, Senator Kindike Kithure and a host of allied MCAs and aspirants.
