A Kisumu County government employee Benson Wambia has been arrested over the theft of Sh500,000. Wambia was arrested by officers from Kondele Police Station on Thursday. He works at the county government ICT department. He allegedly stole the money from Kelvin Okumu,30, while he was heading to the bank. County police commander Alphonse Kimanthi said Ouma led officers to his residence at Kisumu West sub-county where upon search, some Sh151,000 was recovered. “The complainant had reported to Kondele police station that Sh500,000 was stolen from him by a person (suspect) known to him,” Kimanthi said. Police also recovered six original title deeds of different persons, assorted national identity cards, the chief’s stamp for South West location and 116 pieces of assorted passport photos. They also recovered a 55-inch television set suspected to be the proceeds of the stolen money. Kimanthi said the suspect is detained at the station waiting to be arraigned. “The investigations are ongoing and we will take him to court soon,” the police boss said.
