Former Machachari actor Ian Nene, alias Almasi, wants to keep a snake as his pet. In a recent post on Instagram, Almasi was seen playing with a snake on his neck. He captioned the videos, "A day filled with love and a desire to own my own pet snake." In one of the videos, Almasi was seen happily dancing with his Hindu friends. A fan identified as merab_weri commented, saying spirituality is the most peaceful thing and that he should 'keep doing you'. A few years ago, Almasi said he had tattooed his feet with two lotus flower tattoos. The tattoos were a confirmation of his conversion to Hinduism, which happened back in 2018, and he has been vocal ever since about his dedication to his faith.
