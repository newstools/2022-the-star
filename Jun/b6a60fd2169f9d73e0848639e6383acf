At least 1,000 boda boda operators from Kirinyaga Central are set to undergo a two-month training to improve their driving skills. The training will equip them with knowledge on general and personal road safety, professional ethics and customer care. MP Munene Wambugu said the riders will by the end of the training receive an internationally recognised licence that would enable them to operate across the Eastern Africa region. The legislator spoke on Friday when he launched the training. He said the government will spend Sh5 million to train the riders. About Sh5,450 will be spent on each rider to cater to both training and the licence. Wambugu said the training will be conducted annually. “I call on all the trainees to seize the opportunity and take the learning very seriously so that they can qualify to be competent riders. Those riders who will not benefit under this phase should get ready for next round.” The riders were given reflector jackets and helmets to guarantee visibility and safety. The helmet is a European-specialised standard approved design that is not bulky and enables proper distribution of air, so the rider does not sweat while wearing it. “We only managed to distribute 500 helmets but I will continue sourcing for more to ensure the remaining riders get theirs before the end of their training," MP Munene said. Automobile Association of Kenya (AAR) has been mandated to undertake the training. Timothy Keli, the company's head of business development, said they have been collaborating with government agencies across the country in offering auto-related training. “My team of five officers who include highly experienced instructors will offer their best, such that those who qualify after the intense training will come out being the best of the best,” he said.
