Detectives based in Kericho county are investigating an incident where unknown thugs broke into the pastoral residence of St Mark Catholic Parish in Litein. The suspects are said to have left with an unspecified amount of money. Parish Priest Fr Moses Langat reported to authorities at Litein police station that on the night of May 31 and June 1, unknown thugs broke into their house by shattering a windowpane at night. "The incident shocked the priests who were fast asleep in an adjacent room as the thugs also gained entry into the church and vandalised the tabernacle, a liturgical furnishing used to house the Eucharist," DCI said in a tweet. DCI boss George Kinoti said crime scene detectives have since visited both scenes and processed them forensically with the aim of bringing the suspects to book.
