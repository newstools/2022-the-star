President Uhuru Kenyatta has in his capacity as EAC chair called for the deployment of the East African Regional force to the DRC to quell growing insecurity. The President has further called for immediate cessation of hostilities in the eastern provinces of Ituri, North Kivu and South Kivu and the area declared weapons-free through a disarmament exercise. "The hostilities, in particular, threaten to undermine the ongoing political process aimed at addressing the security situation," he said. Regional commanders of respective Defence Forces will meet in Nairobi on Sunday, June 19, 2022, to finalize preparations for the deployment. Uhuru said the EAC forces will help stabilize and enforce peace in support of the DRC security forces working in close coordination with the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO). In April this year, the seven-member East Africa Community made a pact to form a joint force to promote peace, stability and development in Eastern DRC and the greater East African region. Eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced insecurity since fighting erupted on May 24, 2022 near the city of Goma. Uhuru urged both foreign and local-based militia behind the unrest to unconditionally lay down arms and commit to a political process. The EAC chair further asked leaders in member states to commit to finding a lasting peace solution for the people of the DRC. He also called on the political leadership in the region to remain committed to putting in place and reinforcing the political and military efforts in the DRC.
