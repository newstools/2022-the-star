Akothee and Nelly Oaks have raised eyebrows after they decided to unfollow each other online. That wasn't all, Akothee even went as far as deleting the images she had previously posted of herself with Nelly when they were together. The couple who had been singing each other's praises for close to a year seems to have reached an end as far as their relationship goes. Kenyans have reacted to the news with a mixture of surprise and indifference considering that this is indeed Nairobi, the city where break-ups are as common as corruption. Some others meanwhile wondered whether it was a cheap celebrity stunt, something that we still can't be sure of until the two speak themselves.
