Zari Hassan has confirmed she is in a relationship with a new younger lover barely a week after her visit to Kenya. The 41-year-old mother of five introduced her new man as her 'husband' to Tanzanian media. "He is my husband, case closed," she said. Zari also shared a video holding the man, only identified as 'Kibs', saying she is ready to spend the rest of her life with him. "I cannot wait for us to start our life together. I love you, my baby," she said. In another post, Zari captioned their photo, "Can it be 'our page' for a sec. Miss you, Kibs." This will be Zari's third relationship since she broke up with her baby daddy Diamond Platnumz.
