Former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has said he will support Deputy President William Ruto’s presidential bid as Azimio leaders have ignored him. He said he unsuccessfully tried to reach out to Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Azimio campaign team in Western. “DP Ruto has reached out to me several times urging me to support him on his presidential bid and I am here struggling to reach Raila Odinga,” Akaranga told the Star on the phone on Saturday. “Instead of me wasting my time trying to reach someone who does not seem interested, let me work with those who are ready to work with me. I have made up my mind to support Ruto.” Akaranga said he has also unsuccessfully tried to reach out to Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya. Oparanya is the Azimio Western campaign chairperson. Akaranga is seeking to recapture the Vihiga governor seat on the Progressive Party of Kenya. He will be facing incumbent Governor Wilber Ottichilo of ODM, Senator George Khaniri of UDP, Francis Ominde of FPK and Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi of ANC. Akaranga said Agoi is a political toddler and he can’t pull mass votes to DP Ruto’s basket. “I have been in politics as an MP, minister and governor. I have a huge following not just here in Sabatia constituency but across the county,” he said. Edited by A.N
