Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has appointed Saitabao Ole Kanchory as his Chief Agent ahead of the August 9 elections. Speaking after receiving the nomination certificate, Raila named four other leaders who will deputize Kanchory. "I have appointed lawyer Saitabao Sanchory as a national chief agent, he will be deputised by Dr Carolyne Karugu, Prof Isaiah wa Kindiki, Dr Oduor Ongwen and my legal advisor Paul Mwangi," he said Kithure and Isaiah - both professors — are brothers who support two different political factions. Professor Kithure was yesterday named as DP William Ruto’s chief agent in the August polls. Prof Kindiki will be assisted by United Democratic Alliance Secretary General Veronica Maina and Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok. Prof Kithure is Ruto’s political ally who was among those fronted to be his running mate, while his elder brother, Prof Isaiah Kindiki is a Raila’s die-hard supporter. Raila's agents will work in handy with the electoral agency ahead of the August polls. The former prime minister and his running mate Martha Karua were cleared to run for this year's Presidential elections on August 9. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati who is the returning officer for Presidential elections declared the Azimio leader a candidate at exactly 11 am on Sunday. "The documentations are in order and I approve the nomination of Raila Odinga as a presidential candidate in the August 9 elections," he said. "I hereby present the certificate to Raila Odinga as a presidential candidate." The ODM leader urged the commission to ensure the elections are free, fair and verifiable.
