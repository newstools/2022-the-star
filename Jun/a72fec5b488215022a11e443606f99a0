They are flavorful, crispy, melt-in-your-mouth bites of pure comforting goodness and are perfect for any snack or dessert. It is a very popular West African street food that is quick and easy to make with different variations. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a large bowl add the warm water, salt, sugar, and yeast. Set aside for 5 minutes. Step 2 Then add mashed bananas and mix followed by flour, and nutmeg. Mix well until flour and bananas have been fully combined. Step 3 Set the mixture in a warm area and let it rise for 1- 2 hours. Step 4 In a large, sauce pan pour vegetable oil for frying. Step 5 The dough is going to be sticky so use your hands to grab a little bit of mixture at time and drop in the oil or use a spoon to spoon up the paste. Shape them into balls while dropping and ensure you do not overcrowd the pan. Step 6 Fry for a few minutes until the bottom side is golden brown. Then turn the ball over and fry for a few more minutes until the other side is golden brown. Place them on napkins right away to dry.
