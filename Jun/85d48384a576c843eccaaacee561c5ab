Kangemi Ladies, Kayole and Bunyore Starlets were relegated from the Kenya Women's Premier League after the final matches yesterday. Kangemi managed a paltry six points and gave a walkover against Nakuru. Merciless Vihiga Queens sent their 'sisters' Bunyore back to the second tier after just one season in WPL following a 2-1 win at Momboha grounds. Topista Situma's brace also saw her bag the top scorer's award with 17 goals. Kisumu All Starlets edged out Kayole 1-0. The match ended prematurely as the referee cited security concerns. Puren Alekwe scooped a hattrick for Zetech Sparks as the varsity side drew 3-3 with Ulinzi Starlets. Wadadia also drew 1-1 with Thika Queens. Trans-Nzoia Falcons did not honour their match against Gaspo Women after they were irked by Football Kenya Federation Transition Committee's decision to award Kayole points in an abandoned encounter. Vihiga will pocket Sh3 million for winning the 2021-22 WPL title. Monica Etot of Kisumu was feted as Kenya Footballers Welfare Association KEFWA player of the month for May after helping the lakeside club evade relegation.
