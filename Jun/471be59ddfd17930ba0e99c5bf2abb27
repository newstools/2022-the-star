The 2019 Chicago marathon champion Lawrence Cherono and world marathon defending champion Ruth Chepng’etich have vowed to bring marathon medals home during next month's World Championships in Eugene, Oregon in the United States. Cherono said they are aware they carry the country's hopes and will do all in their power to repay Kenyans' faith with a podium finish. “We are a full team and we are committed to leading from the front. We have had a good discussion with teammates and federation president and we want to work together to ensure we fly the country's flag high in Oregon,” Cherono said. The two-time Amsterdam Marathon champion finished fourth at the Olympic Games last year in Tokyo, Japan before settling for second place to fellow countryman Evans Chebet in Boston the last April. The two had met at the Valencia Marathon last year where Cherono emerged tops. The Baringo-born runner, who trains at Dr. Rosa and Associati Camp in Kaptagat, will team up with two-time New York Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor, Barnabas Kiptum, and Geoffrey Kirui  (reserve) in Oregon. On her part, Chepngetich said the World Championship is worth the wait despite being postponed to this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic. “ I am praying that we have good results in Oregon and I am ready to defend my title,” Chepng'etich, who set a world half-marathon record of 1:04:02 in 2021, said. She will team up with Maureen Jepkemoi, Angela Tanui, and Judith Jeptum in the women's category. The two were speaking over the weekend during a visit by the Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei. Tuwei said the selected teams will train at their usual training venues to avoid last-minute inconvenience. “We have agreed that the marathoners will be training at their usual camps because it is not good to change venue less than a month before the global show in Oregon. However, we shall support them fully,” Tuwei said.
