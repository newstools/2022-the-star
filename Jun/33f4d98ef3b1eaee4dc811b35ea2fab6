Vihiga Queens will only sign backup attacking players to offer depth in the already star-studded side ahead of the 2022/23 season, head coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has said. The Kenya Women's Premier League champions have one of the most formidable squads in the division and are hellbent on keeping their title-winning squad, but with few additions. "We already have the best players in all positions so there's no need to sign big names, who come with a lot of demands. It is only in attack where we were short of options last season, especially after the departure of our two dependable strikers," said Nyamunyamu. "We are scouting for three young players in the Division One League, who we believe will be suited to our philosophy. We resolved not to release any player because the management has invested a lot in the playing unit." The four-time WPL champions lost the intimidating duo of Tereza Engesha and Jentrix Shikangwa, who left for greener pastures overseas. 21-year-old Shikangwa signed for Fatih Karagumruk of Turkey in January while Engesha moved to South Korean WK League club Hyundai Steel Red Angels in March. Topista Situma was the only recognised striker in Vihiga's title-winning team. Agnes Olesi, who was signed before Vihiga headed to the CAF Women's Champions League in Egypt in November last year played just twice last season after suffering a serious knee injury. "We want to get our business done as soon as possible to allow us start preparing for the new season," said Nyamunyamu. Vihiga won the inaugural Cecafa regional club qualifiers for Champions League last year in Nairobi but won't feature in this year's edition. Kenya are currently suspended from all football-related activities by world football governing body Fifa.
