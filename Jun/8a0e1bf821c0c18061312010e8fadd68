A gang that killed a tuk-tuk rider in Kasarani area, Nairobi is on the run. The body of Harun Wangendo, 38, was found hanged in his tuk-tuk that had been abandoned on the roadside. Police and the family said the victim went missing on Sunday but his body was found in the tuk-tuk on Monday hanged therein. Kasarani police boss Peter Mwazo said they suspect the victim was killed elsewhere and the body driven to the scene and hanged in his tuk-tuk. “There was no sign of struggle at the scene and we suspect this was a murder committed elsewhere and the body ferried to the scene to show he committed suicide,” he said. He added no arrest had been made and that the hunt for the killers is ongoing. The motive of the murder is however yet to be known. Elsewhere, police are investigating an incident in which a 26-year-old man was found dead in his house after an apparent suicide mission in Kabete staff quarters area, Nairobi. This is the latest such incident to be reported. Another one was reported in Taru, Kwale County. Police said the man in the Kabete incident is said to have argued with unknown people before he came home furious and hanged himself in his bedroom. The body was moved to the mortuary. Police say cases of suicide have been on the rise and that they handled 499 cases in 2019 and 575 in 2020. At least 313 people are reported to have taken their lives between January and July 2021. Meanwhile, police are investigating how a seven-month-old baby died while under the care of a helper in Dagorreti area, Nairobi. The mother of Joyness Moraa had left her with a helper after she went to work but was called hours later and informed the baby was unresponsive. The helper told police she fed the infant and put her to sleep but on checking on her, she realized the baby was not responding when they raised alarm. The body was taken to mortuary where a postmortem is planned as part of the probe into the incident.
