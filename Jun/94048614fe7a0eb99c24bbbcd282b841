African 100m record holder Ferdinand Omanyala says he is just getting started after clinching gold in the men's 100m at the ongoing Senior Africa Athletics Championships in Reduit, Mauritius. Omanyala is expected to return to action on Saturday morning as the qualification round of the men's 200m commences. "We have equaled the championship record of 9.94 and I am happy to have finally won gold. Now we shift focus to the 200m in which I will be running on Saturday. From here henceforth, it is just to enjoy the experience...to have fun," Omanyala said. He clocked 9.93 in a closely-fought contest at Cote d'Or National Sports Complex to take top honours ahead of the former record holder, Akane Simbine of South Africa who also timed 9.93 in a photo finish. Another South African, Henricho Bruintjies, finished third in 10.01. As has been the case in many 100m races in the recent past, the sprinters had to endure tense moments after a false start. Omanyala, who has been in several of those situations, explained his relief at finishing the race without any more mishaps. He also saluted his competitors for a very tight race. "Yes, this is the fourth time I have found myself in that situation but I thank God that the ending was perfect. It was a very tough race...tougher than I had even expected. Simbine is a very great runner. I salute him for a very good contest," the national 100m record holder said. It was a plentiful harvest for Team Kenya on the second day of the championship. Omanyala's win came a few minutes after Winnie Chebet had led a 1-2 Kenyan finish in the women's 1500m. Chebet clocked  4:16.10, ahead of World Under 20 1,500m champion Purity Chepkirui who clocked 4:16.28 as Ethiopian Dagnachew Ayal finished third in 4:16.28. Later in the evening, Winnie's namesake, Beatrice Chebet earned Kenya's third gold when she clocked 15:00.82 to clinch the women's 5000m. Ethiopian Belayneh Fentaye timed 15:01.89 in second as another Kenyan, Caroline Nyaga, claimed bronze in 15:05.34. Abraham Longosiwa was Kenya's first medalist, clocking 29:23.02 in the men's 10,000m to win bronze in a race held on Wednesday afternoon. Tumay Mogos led a 1-2  Ethiopian finish, timing 29:19.01 ahead of fellow countryman Debele Chimidesa who came second in 29:22.74. Meanwhile, World Athletics president Seb Coe believes the performances in Mauritius thus far are a precursor to the World Championship in Oregon next month. Speaking on the sidelines of the continental showpiece, Coe admitted that the competition has gone up a notch. "Many countries have come of age in athletics, not just the big powerhouses like Ethiopia and Kenya. We have the likes of Namibia and Botswana have made a mark not only on the continent but in the world. Going to Eugene for the World Championship in a few weeks' time, we expect to see some great African performances," Coe said.
