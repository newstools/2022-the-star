Kenyan social impact enterprise, Carakana was launched yesterday as an online exhibition for embroidery products. Through Google Arts and Culture (GAC), Carakana supports marginalised women and people living with disabilities to learn cross stitching and traditional craft, turning it into an income. The page will include online exhibits narrated by marginalised women and people living with disabilities, who explain their circumstances and the role Carakana has played in their lives. The initiative is led by Second Lady Rachel Ruto, who welcomed the development. “Going online means opening up the work of our women, who are supported by Carakana to a worldwide audience,” she said. A beneficiary, Zipporah said, “This project has enabled me to meet my family’s needs as well as my own.”
