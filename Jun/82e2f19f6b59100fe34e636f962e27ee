Detectives on Thursday arrested a Guyanese national wanted in the United States for conspiracy to traffic narcotic drugs. He was arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) following intelligence leads. According to DCI, Spencer was allegedly involved in a cocaine smuggling ring in Guyana, that conspired to smuggle cocaine into the US. Guyana is situated in central north of the South American continent, with a coastline at the North Atlantic Ocean. "In 2015, the syndicate smuggled 1.5 kgs of cocaine through a shoe luggage, leading to Spencer’s arrest in 2016," the DCI said. The suspect was subsequently taken to court but released on pre-trial conditions. He then violated the conditions and a warrant of arrest was issued on March 17, 2017. "Again, he violated pre-trial conditions of non-appearance and change of address without reporting, leading to another warrant which was issued on March 19, 2018." The suspect has been on the run until Thursday morning when he was arrested. Earlier, five suspects were arrested after being busted with narcotics, among them two South Africans. "After a detailed search in the apartment, several items were recovered, including 240 pellets of unknown substances believed to be narcotic drugs, five mobile phones, a laptop and travel documents," DCI said. They are believed to be part of a transnational drug trafficking syndicate. On Friday, a suspected paedophile needed in the UK was also arrested. Anthony Kinuthia Kamau is expected to answer to charges of sexual harassment of minors at the Chelmsford Crown Court of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
