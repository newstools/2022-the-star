Chief magistrate Zainab Abdul, said the weapon was never recovered, and it is being used in the streets putting many lives at risk. During interrogation, the magistrate said the family of the accused requested to have the court grant them a non-custodial sentence. However, the court said the offence alongside the evidence produced, the case should not be granted a non-custodial sentence. “Following the recent incidents, there has been an increase in the number of people getting robbed at gunpoint while boda bodas help them escape,” the magistrate said. “Therefore, the court is mandated to give a punishment that will serve as a warning to anyone who will commit a similar offence.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
