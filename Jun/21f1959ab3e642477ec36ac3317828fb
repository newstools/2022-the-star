Quite filling and a healthy breakfast option, spinach and scrambled eggs are a very nutritious breakfast. This scramble may not look like much, but it is delicious. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Heat a very large (12-14 inch) nonstick skillet over medium-for heat, about 2 minutes. Add the olive oil. Step 2 Add the onion slices. Sprinkle them with a pinch of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 5 minutes. Lower the heat to medium. Step 3 While the onion is cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, ½ teaspoon salt, a pinch of black pepper, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan. Set aside. Step 4 When the onions are golden brown, add the spinach leaves to the skillet. Cook, stirring, just until beginning to wilt, about 1 minute. Step 5 Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Cook the eggs over medium heat, pushing them back and forth with a rubber spatula, until set to your liking. Sprinkle with red pepper and serve with a cup of hot tea or coffee.
