Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga had been cleared to run for this year's Presidential elections on August 9. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati who is the returning officer for Presidential elections declared the Azimio leader a candidate at exactly 11 am on Sunday. "The documentations are in order and I approve the nomination of Raila Odinga as a presidential candidate in the August 9 elections," he said. "I hereby present the certificate to Raila Odinga as a presidential candidate." Raila was accompanied by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Gideon Moi (Baringo Senator), Charity Ngilu (Kitui Governor), Junnet Mohamed (Suna East MP), Timothy Bosire (ODM Treasurer), Edwin Sifuna (ODM SG), Sabina Chege (Muranga MP), Governor Prof. Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu), John Waluke (Sirisia MP), Governor Ann Kananu (Nairobi), Maina Kamanda (nominated MP), Esther Passaris (Nairobi Woman rep) and Governor Nderitu Muriithi (Laikipia). Raila and Deputy President William Ruto, who was cleared on Saturday, are seen as the clear front runners in the succession race. Raila has been counting on the influence of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who hails from the Mt Kenya region, to boost his quest to topple  Ruto’s popularity in the region. A number of Cabinet secretaries have publicly declared their preference for Raila and his choice to pick a woman to be his deputy was seen as calculated move to boost his presidential bid. After presenting the papers to IEBC, Raila is scheduled to hold a rally at Undugu grounds in Lang’ata constituency. According to a statement by Raila’s presidential campaign secretariat press secretary Dennis Onsarigo, the former PM will then leave for Nakuru for roadside rallies starting at 2pm. He is also scheduled to hold a rally at Mazembe grounds, Bondeni area in Nakuru at 4pm. On Monday, Raila is scheduled to launch the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition party manifesto at Nyayo National Stadium.
