If you are a night owl, the chances of you waking up early are very minimal. It is either you wake up early and be grumpy the whole day or you snooze your alarm and get to work late. While it would be great to live in a world that lets us night owls prosper,  most of us find that we need to wake up earlier in order to achieve our goals. Night owls who have delayed sleep phase disorder may also suffer from sleep onset insomnia and morning sleepiness. Night owls have an increased risk for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Just like the way habits are formed, make slow and steady changes often and you will soon have a certain sleep pattern. Experts recommend going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day in order to maintain and develop good sleep hygiene. Stretch before bed, have a glass of water, and put your phone away.
