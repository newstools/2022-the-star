The government is seeking to rope in youths from Kitui's remote villages in the  Kazi Mtaani programme as opposed to the situation in the past when only those in Kitui and Mwingi towns benefited. Kitui County Commissioner Mbogai Rioba who launched phase three of the Kazi Mtaani on Tuesday said unlike in the past, the programme will benefit youth in all corners of the county. Briefing journalists on the programme, Rioba said although the government has only allocated 5,129 Kazi Mtaani slots for Kitui this time round, over 12,000 youth applied for the jobs online. “Those who applied for the jobs online were over 12,000 when we have only 5,129 job slots for the programme including the supervisors. It shows the number of the jobless youth was high.” Rioba admitted that due to the overwhelming number of applicants, there will be a rigorous job of sifting through the applications in order to pick only those who suitably qualified. He further said the youth would be engaged in doing community work in public sites as their contribution to nation building and earn income in the process. The County Commissioner said the youth would be engaged for three months between June and end of August 2022. Kitui County director of housing Samson Mutune, who had accompanied Rioba during the press conference, said the youth to be absorbed in the Kazi Mtaani will work in shifts. “One group will work for 10 days and rest as another group takes over for 10 days,” he said. He also disclosed that each youth will be entitled to a stipend of Sh455 in a day while those who would be hired as supervisors would be paid Sh505 daily.
