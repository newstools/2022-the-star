West Ham have completed the signing of Morocco defender Nayef Aguerd from Ligue 1 side Rennes for £30m. The Premier League club have confirmed that the 26-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the Hammers. The left-sided player made 66 league appearances for Rennes after joining from fellow French club Dijon in 2020. “I was really excited when I heard about West Ham’s interest,” he said. “I knew I needed to go to the Premier League, it’s a dream for every player.” The transfer fee for Aguerd, who has 25 caps for Morocco, is the fourth-highest paid by West Ham, behind only those for Sebastien Haller, Felipe Anderson and Kurt Zouma. In a farewell post to fans on social media, Aguerd said it was a “difficult decision” to leave Rennes as he had enjoyed “exceptional times” at the club.
