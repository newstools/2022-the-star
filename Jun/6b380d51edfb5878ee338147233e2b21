From 2017 to date, the senators have had to bury three of their colleagues. A report by Mzalendo Trust titled The Legislative Scorecard – Senate has highlighted that three senators died while in office. On December 11, 2020, Machakos Senator Boniface Kabaka Mutinda died while receiving treatment at a Nairobi hospital a week after he ended up in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mystery still surrounds what happened to Kabaka at a hotel apartment in Nairobi where he was meeting Esther Nthenya Muli, a secondary school teacher from Wote, Makueni County. Kabaka drove himself to 3Dee apartments with no bodyguard or driver. Investigators told a Nairobi court that the senator checked in at 2 pm and booked apartment No 306. He is said to have looked normal, with no sign of illness. One hour later, investigators claimed he was joined by a woman -Muli - a deputy principal and secondary school Kiswahili teacher. At night, the senator suddenly fell sick, collapsed and had to be rushed to Nairobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Garissa Senator Mohamed Yusuf Haji aged, 80, passed away on February 15, 2021, at the Aga Khan Hospital, Nairobi, where he was receiving treatment. He was also the chairperson of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) task force at the time of his death. Haji was serving his second term as the Garissa senator. On August 17, 2021, Nominated Senator Victor Prengei, died in a road accident at Gioto along the Nakuru-Kabarak highway. He joined Parliament in 2017 on a Jubilee Party ticket, making him the first legislator from the minority Ogiek community. The lawmaker was heading towards Kabarak direction from Nakuru Town when the vehicle he was driving lost control and careened off the road before landing in a ditch at 9:45 pm. At 37, Prengei represented young people in Senate and spelt hope for the Ogiek community which had been overlooked in political circles for decades.
