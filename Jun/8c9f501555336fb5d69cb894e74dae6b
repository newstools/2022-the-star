The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has announced that 246,465 deceased voters have been discovered in the ongoing audit. 481,711 duplicate records and 226,143 voters registered with IDs that do not validly belong to them were also found. The number of registered voters with invalid identification documents (IDs and Passports) was 164,269. The total number of voters in the register who risk being scrapped is 1.18 million. Ther revelations were made during a press conference held on Wednesday evening. IEBC Chair Wafula Chebukati and KPMG officials addressed the media on the status of the ongoing audit. KPMG is a firm contracted to audit the register. The Audit was supposed to be published by June 9 but the exercise is yet to be concluded. The register is expected to be ready by June 16. The Commission boss Wafula Chebukati said they will engage stakeholders on the final register of voters on June 17. "However, due to implementation of preliminary audit findings on the register, the Commission has decided to address the findings prior to certifying the register for publication on/or before June 20," Chebukati said. He said the Commission engaged KPMG on April 7,  to conduct an audit of the Register of Voters, while the continuous voter registration activity was ongoing. The continuous registration of voters ended on May 4, and thereafter verification of the register commenced for a period of 30 days ending  June 2. "The KPMG audit commenced with an understanding of these processes and internal controls around registration and preparation of the register while awaiting completion of the Register of Voters," Chebukati said. "These issues have to be addressed prior to certification and publishing of the register."
