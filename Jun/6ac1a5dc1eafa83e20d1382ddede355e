Kenyan race walker Emily Ngii says training in hilly areas was the secret weapon that clinched her the gold in the women's 20km walk at the Senior Africa Athletics Championships in Mauritius on Sunday morning. Ngii was among three Kenyans to earn the country gold at the continental showpiece on the ultimate day of competition at Cote D'Or National Sports Complex. "The course was not bad for me although the weather was really bad. Back home, I have been training in a hilly area and so when I came here, the course was not bad for me. Even after crossing the finish line, I felt I could go for another 10km," Ngii said amidst laughter. On a wet Sunday morning, the Kenyan clocked 1:34:30 to upstage 2018 champion Yehualeye Beletew of Ethiopia, who finished second in 1:35:48. Another Kenyan, Sylvia Kemboi, making her competitive debut on the international stage, took bronze after clocking 1:39:40. Ngii says the win has motivated her for greater things ahead as she eyes a podium finish at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in August. "I was not expecting to win but here I am. I am very happy to have won this gold medal. I thank God so much for enabling me to win. Now I want to win another gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and I know I can do it," she said. It was double delight for Kenya in race walking as Samuel Gathimba also clinched gold in the men's 20km race walk, timing 1:22:01 ahead of South African Wayne Snyman (1:22:05) and Ethiopian Yohanis Algaw (1:22:21) in second and third respectively. Gathimba, who won bronze at the World Race Walking Team Championships in Oman in March, credited the tough competition for pushing him all the way to the finish line. He also paid homage to Kenyans back home for supporting the team through the competition. "It was the tough competition that pushed me all the way to the title. I want to thank all my fans back home in Kenya for the support they have given me. That is who we are...we do wonders because we believe in God," Gathimba said. Team Kenya have been a dominant force thus far in the five-day championship, bagging nine gold, two silver and six bronze medals. In the women's 800m, Jarinter Mwasya timed 2:02.80 to clinch gold as Ethiopian Desta Nestanet (2:02.99) and South African Prudence Sekgodiso (2:03.46) finished second and third respectively. Abel Kipsang continued his unbeaten streak this year, clocking 3:36.57 to win the 1500m title ahead of South African Ryan Mphahlele (3:36.74) and Ethiopian Kasaye Adeyena (3:38.27). On Saturday, Caroline Nyaga topped off a productive outing in Mauritius with a gold medal in the women's 10,000m. The police officer timed 32:12.61 ahead of Ugandan Zena Chebet (32:17.66) and Ethiopian Gebre Meseret (32:25.97). Nyaga had earlier bagged a bronze in the women's 5000m in which fellow countrywoman, 2016 World Under 20 5,000m champion Beatrice Chebet, grabbed gold. Team Kenya are expected back in the country at 11.20 am on Monday.
