Three officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations were over the moon after they received news of their promotions through President Uhuru Kenyatta in a manner they did not anticipate. The three are director of the Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau, Paul Mumo, the deputy director of Forensics Margaret Karanja and Central Regional Police boss Manasseh Musyoka. They had accompanied the DCI boss George Kinoti, to visit Nyeri archbishop, His Grace Anthony Muheria. Kinoti had planned a surprise visit to Archbishop Muheria, who is his close confidant and spiritual mentor and the three volunteered to accompany him on the visit. "Apart from seeking the Archbishop’s intercession for police officers and their families as we head to the forthcoming general elections, the team had prepared a surprise birthday party for the man of God," Kinoti said. It was after the brief cake-cutting celebration and prayer that news of the elevation of the three from Commissioners of police to Assistant Inspector General, was announced. The officers who couldn’t hide their joy celebrated and thanked God for their elevation. The DCI boss also thanked the Commander-in-Chief for recognising the officers’ efforts in fighting crime and rewarding them with promotions. Mumo, is the head of the elite Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) credited with responding to incidents of crime expeditiously and putting criminals where they belong. Kinoti was also accompanied by the director Investigations Bureau, John Gachomo and the director planning at NPS headquarters Patrick Ndunda. Also in the entourage was the governor of Nairobi Count Anne Kananu, among others.
