Kakamega Women representative Elsie Muhanda has been cleared by IEBC to defend her seat. Muhanda who is vying on an ODM ticket was handed the certificate by Kakamega IEBC county County coordinator Joseph Ayatta on Thursday. The legislator who is making a second stab for the affirmative action position said she is confident that she would retain the seat. She is banking on her closeness to the people of Kakamega for the last five years and her development track record in wooing voters to back her. “I have made a strong mark across the county from the urban areas into the interior. I have sent many to school, including young mothers who got into the family way before completing their education." Muhanda will face off with six other women who have also been cleared by the IEBC to run for the same position. Nominated Senator Naomi Shiyonga is among the top contenders. Shiyonga of DAP-K commonly was cleared by the IEBC on Wednesday. “I want to thank God for enabling me to go through the IEBC process," she said. "I have an agenda of empowering women of Kakamega because they suffer most in terms of taking care of their families. I want to do things that will touch their hearts." Hadija Nganyi who is also vying for the seat was given a clean bill of health by IEBC on Thursday. She has hit the ground running with optimism that she will clinch the women's seat. “I thank the IEBC, their process has been very smooth and fast. Now I have been given a green light to start my campaigns," she said. "I want to ask the people of Kakamega to vote for change because for a long the women have suffered, the widows, single mothers and the young Mothers alike and the youth." Others who have been cleared by the electoral commission to vie for the seat include Dr Alice Agoi( KANU) and Dr Consolata Lusweti(ANC). Two of the aspirants who are yet to go through the process of IEBC verification are former radio presenter Lydia Pamela Inyangala(UDP) and Rose Musawa(MDP).
