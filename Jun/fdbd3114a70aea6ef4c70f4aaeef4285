The health services department in Taita Taveta county is set to roll out a disability-inclusive cancer awareness and screening project. The project brings on board visually impaired, deaf and non-disabled community health volunteers. Health Services executive John Mwakima said Taita Taveta is one of seven counties selected for the rollout of the project because of its efforts toward early detection and treatment of cancer. This follows the establishment of the County Cancer Centre at Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi. “This is a key project that is geared towards fighting the cancer menace, especially among the people with disabilities. This will go a long way in boosting the current interventions being put in place,” Mwakima said. He said the project will be implemented in collaboration with the county government, Amref Health Africa and Roche East Africa. The intervention, the executives said, seeks to strengthen and improve primary healthcare through the delivery of better health outcomes. “Specifically, the project is set to enhance breast cancer and cervical cancer prevention, treatment control and management,” Mwakima said in an interview on Sunday. He said some 10 CHVs with hearing, speech and visual impairment and four without disability will undergo specialised training. Further, Mwakima said the main objective of the project is to increase knowledge and understanding of cervical and breast cancer among people with hearing and visual impairment. “It will also improve health-seeking behaviour on cervical and breast cancer among people living with hearing and visual impairment,” he added. Once implemented, he said, it will enhance the capacity of CHVs to screen and refer clients for early diagnosis and treatment. It will also improve patient-doctor interaction by eliminating chances of misunderstanding about their disease and treatment.(edited by Amol Awuor)
