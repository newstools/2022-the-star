Gingerbread refers to a broad category of baked goods, typically flavored with ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon and sweetened with honey, sugar, or molasses. Gingerbread foods vary, ranging from a soft, moist loaf cake to something close to a ginger biscuit. Gingerbread originates from ancient Greeks and Egyptians who used it as a ceremonial offering. The making of gingerbread is considered a Fine Art.
