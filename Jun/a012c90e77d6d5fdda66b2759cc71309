Bungoma county commissioner Samwel Kimithi has warned residents and politicians against political violence saying they will act firmly on the perpetrators . Speaking during Madaraka celebrations held in Kabuchai, Kimithi called for political tolerance among all the political divides. "We don't want violence in the region, because we will not allow lives and properties to be lost," said Kimiti. He further urged politicians to desist from inciting messages . Kimithi lauded the ministry of interior for adding Bungoma county with three additional sub-counties: Kopsiro, Kimaeti sub-county in Bumula and Tongaren sub-county in Bungoma north. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati called on residents to keep peace in the August 9th elections. Addressing the event, the governor said Kenya shall exist even after elections. "Elections come and go but this country will forever remain," he said. Wangamati appealed for peace during the campaigns, during voting and even after the poll. He also called on Kenyans to reflect on what we have achieved as a Country, the hits and the misses and agree on what we all must do to take Kenya forward. The Governor further urged residents to vote for him saying he comes from the same constituency and they should not let down their own. In a clear reference to Bungoma senator Moses Wetang'ula, Wangamati wondered why he was fighting him yet they all come from Kabuchai. "This seat should remain in Kabuchai because this is the most important seat," said Wangamati.
