The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority has listed nine filling stations selling adulterated fuel to unsuspecting members of the public. In a statement on Thursday, EPRA said during the period April - June, a total of 5,276 tests were conducted at 1,191 petroleum sites and 99.24 percent of the sites were found to be compliant. However, the commission said tests from nine sites turned out to be non-compliant. The nine sites are Dultome Oil Filling Station in Sinyolo, Enziu Filling Station in Kitui, Olympic Fuels Filling Station in Kisumu, Manyatta Fuel Matt & Lubricants Filling Station, Kaewa Market in Machakos and Grace Filling Station in Sio Port Busia. Others are Abdifatah Abdullahi Filling Station in Kakamega, Edward Gitonga Filling Station in Nakuru, Modern Filling Station in Kakamega and Kobodo 1 Filling Station in Homabay. The irregular activities conducted by the stations were selling domestic kerosene marker dilution detected in domestic kerosene and offering for sale super petrol adulterated with domestic kerosene meant for export. EPRA said it is mandated under Section 92 of the Petroleum Act 2019 to monitor petroleum products offered for sale in the local market with the aim of preventing motor fuel adulteration or dumping of export-bound fuels. "In this regard, the Authority undertakes a program of continuous monitoring of the quality of petroleum motor fuels on sale, transport and storage throughout the country," read part of the statement.
