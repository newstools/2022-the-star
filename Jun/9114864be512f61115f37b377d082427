The multi-agency security team conducting a security operation in Marsabit County recovered four firearms in different places on Tuesday. Intensive security patrol was carried out in Kargi Division where they recovered three Mark 4 Rifles that were surrendered to the local chief. "The other 3 rifles were recovered after stop check of two motor vehicles between Segel and Kargi," National Police Service (NPS) said in a tweet. The officers arrested the drivers of the motor vehicles and an Ethiopian. The recovered firearms were then taken to Marsabit Police Station and the suspects were taken to police custody as investigations go on. Last week, the team recovered five rifles in an operation. The firearms include three Carbine rifles loaded with two rounds of ammunition, an AK-47, and a G-3 without ammunition, NPS said. The government launched Operation Rejesha Amani Marsabit in May and is being steered by GSU commander Bernard Kituku Mbatha. The operation aims at restoring peace and security in the region and neighbouring Isiolo county. The Marsabit operation has progressed according to plan and police say there have been no attacks in the past months. Despite some residents protesting harassment by police, some have lauded it, saying it has resorted security in the area. The operation is being led by special forces drawn from the GSU, the Rapid Deployment Unit, the Quick Response Unit and the Anti-Stock Theft Unit. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said the operation will run in tandem with disarmament targeting illegal guns and bullets. He said the National Security Council launched 'Operation Rejesha Amani Marsabit' following incessant inter-ethnic attacks. The CS said the assailants defied peace initiatives, including the lapse of the 30-day window sought by county leaders to secure reconciliation.
