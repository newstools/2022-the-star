A series of new photos shows how Europe's first ever underwater restaurant. Under is becoming one with life beneath the waves off the south coast of Norway. Three years after completion, architects Snøhetta's watery passion project has fully integrated into its setting as these pictures by photographer Timon Koch show. The restaurant was designed to fully integrate into its marine environment over time welcoming limpets and kelp to inhabit it and supporting the rich biodiversity of the surrounding area. So much so that sea life now looks like they are perusing the menu - even though they may end up on it! Mussels have become an important part of the menu in the restaurant and the kitchen continues its meticulous focus on using every ingredient possible, including items not normally used for food. It is situated in Lindesnes, where the less salty water from the Baltic Sea meets the very salty Atlantic Ocean and allows marine biologists have been able to study underwater life and fish behavior up-close.
