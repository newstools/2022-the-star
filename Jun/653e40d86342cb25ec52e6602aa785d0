A baked potato is a preparation of potato often served with fillings, toppings, or condiments such as butter, cheese, sour cream, gravy, baked beans, and even ground meat or bacon. It is perfect for brunch or a heavy breakfast. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Step 2 Place potatoes directly on oven rack in the center of the oven for 40 to 45 minutes or until potatoes are tender through the center without slicing. Step 3 Remove and allow potatoes to cool for about 15 minutes. Then slice each potato in half vertically and hollow each half out, scooping the potato flesh into a mixing bowl. Step 4 Add butter and cream to the potato and mash together until smooth then season with salt and pepper and stir together. Step 5 Spread 1 tablespoon of potato mixture into the bottom of each hollowed potato skin and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cheese. Add 1 slice of bacon to each half and top with a raw egg. Step 6 Place potatoes onto a baking sheet and return to the oven. Lower oven temperature to 180 degrees and bake potatoes until egg whites just set and yolks are still runny, 18 to 24 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and finish with sliced Dhania and enjoy with French fries.
