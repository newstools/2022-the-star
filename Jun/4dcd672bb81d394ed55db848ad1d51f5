Azimio leader Raila Odinga has dismissed claims that he secretly auctioned the country's three ports to a Dubai-based firm. Through his presidential secretariat spokesperson, Makau Mutua, Raila said the accusations made by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadia and the entire Kenya Kwanza team are untrue. "I have consulted with Raila about the matter. He has undoubtedly dismissed this allegation with the contempt they deserve," Mutua said. He pointed out that since the ODM leader is not in the government, he does not have any legal capacity to enter into any official contacts on its behalf. Mutua said the allegations are Kenya Kwanza's latest attempt to deflect their imminent defeat in the upcoming August 9, general elections. "This latest attempt, like many others, is uncalled for and unbecoming of a side picking anything and everything to shore up their dwindling numbers." Mutua pointed out that their opponents have every right to compare their campaign platform and policies with that of Azimio. "Still, they must cease defamatory allegations that continue to feature during the public engagement," he added. Makau reiterated that the William Ruto- led camp was up for a defeat despite using conmanship and half-truths in their campaigns. These remarks came after Mudavadi on Wednesday said President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila illegally sold the ports of Mombasa, Lamu and Kisumu, to a Dubai-based Port World FZE. Mudavadi alleged the deal was signed by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani. This, has, however, not yet been established. “Why would a government with less than five weeks leave office hurriedly and secretly auction the operations, development, redevelopment and management of our ports to a foreign country?” Mudavadi asked. Mudavadi and the other leaders present said they have evidence to support their claims and claimed the deal was signed at a Mombasa meeting masked as a birthday event.
