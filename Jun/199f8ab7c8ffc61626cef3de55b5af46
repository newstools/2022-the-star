The rapper has rejected a claim that she is trying to boost streaming numbers by featuring two older singles on her upcoming album. In a new interview with Centrefold, the I Like It rapper confirmed WAP and Up will be included on her second record, which does not yet have a title or release date. Earlier this week, a Twitter user claimed Cardi's decision was due to the “streaming era” and wrote that “artists just do this to get certifications for their album”.
