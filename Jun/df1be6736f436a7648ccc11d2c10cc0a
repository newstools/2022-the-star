TikTok has announced a new tool that will show a reminder after using the application for a long time, adding a new safeguard to existing daily limits. “Having a positive relationship with digital devices and apps isn't just about measuring screen time, it's also about feeling in control of how we use technology and ensuring that the time we spend online contributes positively to our sense of well-being,” they said in a statement. TikTok says the new tool will add to the existing power that users have to set a limit on application usage. The company says it will roll out prompts that will remind people to take a break after a certain amount of uninterrupted screen time which they can set as they choose. It is introducing a screen time dashboard, which will show a summary of app usage. The statistics include the amount of time the application has been opened, a breakdown of daytime and nighttime usage. It will also have an overall counter for the amount of time spent on the app daily. To set a limit go to settings then click digital well being.
