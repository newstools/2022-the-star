Kenya will not allow itself to be a dumping ground for old technologies, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has said. Kagwe has, however, noted that Kenya remains ready to collaborate with international partners to improve health outcomes and attain the Universal Health Coverage agenda. “Kenya will no longer accept second hand equipment. If someone is generous, let them not give us what is being replaced. There's no generosity in giving what they will throw away anyway,” he said. The CS spoke to the diplomatic corps during the 18th ambassadors and high commissioners’ conference. According to the CS, the country has partnered with global allies in areas such as technology transfer, training and research as it seeks to enhance its capacity and reform the health sector. Kagwe noted that role of the diplomatic community in supporting Kenya deal with the challenge posed by Covid-19 pandemic has seen the country develop the capacity to better deal with emergencies. Kenya has put in place elaborate infrastructure to address similar challenges. “At the onset of Covid-19, we had eight infectious beds at Mbagathi hospital. We responded fast and I can report that every county now has at least double what we had,” Kagwe said. “From zero, we have built 110 laboratories for testing Covid-19. During the period, we increased our sequencing to five labs. We had capacity for a few samples before but now we can do up to 2,500 per week.” Kenya detected its first Covid-19 case on March 12, 2020. To date, the country has recorded 328,319 virus cases, 319,983 recoveries and 5,651 deaths.
