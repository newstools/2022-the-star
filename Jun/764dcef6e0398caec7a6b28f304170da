Word Rally Championship (WRC) Safari Rally has entered the third day. Today, the drivers were wading through a river at Soysambu competitive section. The Shakedown Safari Rally kicked off on Wednesday in Ndulele, Nakuru county. President Uhuru Kenyatta flagged off the rally on Thursday from Kenyatta International Convention Centre in Nairobi, marking the official start of the race. Uhuru said the rally was the second one under his government. The championship offered opportunities for crews to test their cars on terrain similar to the rally venue before the event starts. The competitive sections of the rally are also called special stages, where drivers and co-drivers drive fast as they can to complete the section in the shortest time possible. There are usually three service periods during a WRC day -15 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes at lunchtime and 45 minutes in the evening. The 2022 rally will be hosted in Naivasha from 23rd to 26th June.
