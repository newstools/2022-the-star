The crystal-studded gown, which the Hollywood icon wore to sing happy birthday to U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1962 was loaned to Kim by executives at Ripley's Believe It or Not!, who own the historic piece. Due to the age and provenance of the dress, Kim had to lose 16 pounds to fit into it as no alterations could be made. She also changed into a replica after the red carpet. However, despite all the efforts to preserve the 60-year-old gown, officials at Scott Fortner's The Marilyn Monroe Collection have claimed it suffered some damage.
