Quins' coach Paul Murunga has set his sights on the semifinals of the Driftwood Sevens in Mombasa this weekend. The former Shujaa coach, who was appointed recently by the Ngong-Road side, said there is marked improvement in the team and they will be eyeing a place in the final four in the coastal city after a shaky start to the series. "I reached the quarters during the last tourney — the Christie Sevens—and I will be targeting semis this time around,” said Murunga. The 'Quartered Shirts' face high-flying Menengai Oilers, Nakuru and Blak Blad in Pool 'C' and Murunga has described it as tricky. “Oilers have shown their quality so far this season by getting to the semis twice and will be a tough team to crack. Nakuru and Blak Blak Blad will equally be no pushovers but I  believe we can navigate this pool and qualify for the quarters” he added The former Homeboyz and Mean Machine tactician said he has instilled discipline into the side and believes in the long run, the charges will be a  force to reckon with in both versions of the game. “We are building slowly. We have a lot of players who just sat their KCSE in March and it's a matter of time before they become world beaters,” added Murunga. Quins finished sixth in their home tournament, losing 26-5 to Mwamba in the fifth-sixth playoff match. In the pool stages, Quins beat Nakuru 26-12 and Pirates 24-0 before losing to eventual finalists KCB 19-5. In the quarterfinal, they lost to champions Strathmore 17-10 to drop to the classification fixtures, where they beat Kabras 15-14.  The Kakamega High School alumni expects a competitive circuit with six teams in contention to win a leg of the circuit. “It's a very strong circuit. Front runners KCB and Strathmore are looking solid while Homeboys, Oilers, Mwamba, and ourselves can not be ruled out. Any given any team can win,"  he added.
