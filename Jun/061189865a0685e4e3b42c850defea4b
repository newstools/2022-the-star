Red-hot Kenya Police are banking on their current form to pip Sailors in Sunday's men's Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men's Premier League match set for the City Park Stadium, team captain Victor Wekesa has said. Placed second in the 10-team league with 19 points, the law enforcers have won their last five matches to rekindle their title hopes. Police are a point behind leaders and defending champions Butali Warriors on 20 with the pair expected to go neck-and-neck for the KHU gong. "We came from Mombasa on Monday, where we won the Mombasa 5-a- side tournament. We recently won the Gold Cup Club Invitational tournament and that is enough evidence that we have improved," the Kamusinga alumnus observes. He added: "We want to end the first leg on a high and immediately plan for the second leg. It will be a tough match but we can't afford to drop points and lose ground to our rivals. Players are in good shape  and that gives us a fighting chance for the title." The former champions were expected to struggle in midfield in the absence of experienced midfield dynamo Willis Okeyo. Okeyo, who doubles up as the United States International University (USIU)-A Spartans coach, returned to Germany in April for a fourth spell with Verein Fur Bewegungsspiele VFB Stuttgart for the second leg of the Herren Oberliga League. Police have moved on in the absence of Okeyo with Wekesa impressed with competition in the middle of the pack.  He even warned that Okeyo will have to fight for his place upon return since no one is guaranteed a slot in the starting lineup. "The boys have grabbed the opportunity, risen to the challenge, and silenced critics. There's cut-throat competition for places. We know he has been integral to the success of this team but he will have to prove it again to get back to the team."
