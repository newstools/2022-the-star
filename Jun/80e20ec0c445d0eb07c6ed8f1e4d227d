COTU Secretary General Francis Atwoli has said that he is ready to teach DP William Ruto the ropes on how to become a president if only the DP would allow him to do so. Speaking during an interview with NTV on Thursday, Atwoli said Ruto has what it takes to become a president and only needs a little shaping for him to be a perfect candidate. According to the COTU boss, the UDA presidential candidate was a shrewd leader but lacked good advisors to help him achieve his presidential ambitions. "If Ruto comes to me for help, I will help him greatly. He is a very good leader. What he is lacking is good advisors. He likes chest-thumping," Atwoli said. "I will advise him correctly on how to become a president and I can tell you for sure, he will become a president. But if he still calls me mzee wa nyororo (the man with chains), he will still languish in those problems." Atwoli further said that Ruto was ungrateful to him even after he and his wife helped him during his trials at the International Criminal Court (ICC). He told Ruto if, at all he wants the top seat, he should be careful of his political tactics or watch the Azimio coalition clinch the government and Narc Kenya leader, Martha Karua ascend to power before him. "If Ruto is not careful, Raila will hand over this government to the first woman to be a president of the Republic of Kenya and that will be Martha Karua," Atwoli said. "Karua will become president before Ruto if he continues to call me mtu wa nyororo. I can assure you that."
