Police in Lamu have arrested five individuals who were trying to smuggle 250 rolls of bhang valued at Sh250,000 from Mombasa. The five, three men and two women, were nabbed at Koreni area along the Lamu-Garsen road. The narcotics were being transported in a grey Toyota Voxy. County commissioner Irungu Macharia confirmed the arrest and said the five were being held at the Hindi police station in Lamu West, awaiting arraignment. Police suspect that the bhang originated from Nairobi and Mombasa. “We are interrogating them after which they will be charged on court for possession of narcotics,” Macharia said. Drugs remain a major challenge for security agencies in Lamu with the county commissioner urging members of the public to cooperate by sharing information that will help eliminate the trade. On Friday, Macharia said the arrest is part of a continuous operation to free Lamu from drug abuse. He sounded a warning to PSVs and boat operators, who are aiding the transportation of narcotics saying they risk losing their licences. “If we want a better future for our children, let us report these dealers so that the police can apprehend them and stop them from destroying young lives ,” he said. The arrest of the five drug traffickers comes just a month after the Kenya Coast Guard Service officers impounded a consignment of bhang worth a more than Sh500, 000 in the Indian Ocean.
