Last year’s Kenya Handball Federation runners-up Strathmore University have their eyes set on going one spot better when the new season throws off this weekend. Tactician Peter Mwathi said it is important that the team starts their campaign on a winning note. Strathmore have two matches on the card as they meet Makueni Bees on Saturday and tackle Nairobi City Council (NCC) a day later. “We have two matches to play this weekend and it is important that we start well,” Mwathi said. “We must remain consistent from the word go.” “We have always played well for the better part of the league, only to lose very important matches — which is not good for us. It is also important that we are able to balance defence and attack and improve on individual decision-making during matches that could define our season.” There is not many changes on the team's tactical approach, revealed Mwathi. Young City, another newcomer, have two matches on the cards too. They meet NCC and Black Mamba. Champions National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) men and Nairobi Water Queens will also be in action. NCPB play Makueni Bees and Buccaneers while Water Queens tackle Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat). NCPB head coach Dunstan Eshikumo said they are well prepared and ready for the task ahead. He promised to unleash his new signings. Black Mamba take on Buccaneers while the other women's show will see Jkuat play NCPB, who finished third last year.
