Kenya Ports Authority teams are in Nairobi this weekend for their first Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) outing. The porters, who arrived in the city early, have been training at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium and are upbeat ahead of their four matches on the card. "The training is going on well where we train twice a day at Nyayo," said women's coach Anthony Ojukwu. "We have no injuries, just acclimatising as we try to perfect everything for the weekend." "We thank the management for everything. The new recruits are an asset and have added a lot of options to the team," he added. The men's tactician, Sammy Kiki, said he is prepared for the task ahead but will not underrate any side in their two matches. "We are in Nairobi since yesterday (Wednesday) and the training is going on well. We are working on our team chemistry as we have two new players on board," said Kiki. He said he has no injury concerns at all and will unleash his two new signings in playmaker Joseph Khaemba and shooting guard Eugene Adera. KPA men play Strathmore University Blades on Saturday and then tackle Africa Nazarene University (ANU) the following day. The Blades have made a flying start to the new season, winning their opening three games in a row and a confident coach Tony Ochieng said h wouldn't have asked for anything better. KPA women, who humbled Storms 95-43 in their only tie in Mombasa two weeks ago, will take on Strathmore University Swords and then ANU. The other top women's game will see Eagle Wings take on Storms in a tie that — on paper looks — like a balanced encounter that could go either way. Equity Bank Dumas will step onto the court for the first time to entertain Thunder in a key show. The latter have found their groove after a hard-fought 74-66 win over ANU last week.
