Iga Swiatek extended her winning streak to a record 36th match with a straight-set victory over qualifier Jana Fett in the Wimbledon first round. The world number one, who overtook Venus Williams’ record for the longest streak by a women’s player in the 21st century, beat the Croat 6-0 6-3. Swiatek, in her first match since her French Open win, was not at her best in blustery conditions on Centre Court. “I’m just figuring out how to play,” the 21-year-old Pole said. Meanwhile, Greek fifth seed Maria Sakkari comfortably progressed with a 6-1 6-4 victory over Australian qualifier Zoe Hives. She will face Bulgaria’s Viktoriya Tomova in the next round. Latvian 12th seed Jelena Ostapenko also advanced in impressive fashion by beating Oceane Dodin. The 2017 French Open champion, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2018, secured a 6-4 6-4 win over France’s Dodin. Meanwhile, Italy’s Matteo Berrettini, one of the favourites for the men’s singles, has withdrawn from Wimbledon after testing positive for Covid-19. The 26-year-old, seeded eighth, was beaten by Novak Djokovic in last year’s final and recently won the Queen’s title. “I am heartbroken,” said Berrettini, who said he has had flu symptoms and been isolating for the past few days. He has been replaced in the draw by lucky loser Elias Ymer of Sweden. “I have no words to describe the extreme disappointment I feel,” added Berrettini. “The dream is over for this year, but I will be back stronger.”
