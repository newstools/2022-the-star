Nairobi Water Queens started their Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) title defence on a winning note, hitting Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) 36-16 at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. It was wave after wave of white shirts as the reigning champions attacked, stamping their authority early with a 20-5 halftime cushion. Brenda Arivida, Brenda Musambai and Cecilia Katheu all connected for seven goals for Queens. Jkuat’s Annette Baraza and Catherine Ketapo replied with seven and six respectively. “It was an easy game. But they seemed to have prepared well, far from the team we met last year,” said Queens’ captain Gladys Chilo. “We have the best team and have injected some new players who will take over from us once we exit.” The hard-working Baraza said: “It’s tough playing the champions but we gave a good fight until the end. “We learnt a lot from their defence and attack. They are fast and we needed a lot of energy to match them.” Black Mamba rattled Young City 40-14 in a men’s game. The Kaloleni-based side rolled away to a 22-8 halftime lead and went on to finish the job with consummate ease. Sidney Omondi contributed 13 goals as Morgan Juma and James Wandugu added eight and five respectively. Danstan Shamala shot four goals and Moses Okoth bagged three for the deaf side, who succumbed 25-19 to Nairobi City County (NCC) in their opener. Young City coach Fredrick Omolle said this is their first time in the league and they expect to improve with time. ‘We have alot to learn. Every match is a challenge. When the referees blows the whistle, they don’t hear and this disrupts the tempo,” noted Omolle. “We will have to engage the officials and see how soon we can be helped going forward. Once we can coordinate with the referees, we will improve.” Buccaneers dispatched Jkuat 25-15 as Wiston Chekai scored eight and Randy Ochieng had six.
