Former Rugby Sevens player-turned-400m sprinter is still hopeful despite not making the team to the World Athletics Championships in Oregon. The 33-year-old placed fifth in 46.82 during Commonwealth Games and World Championships trials at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Speaking after the race, Omae expressed optimism that this will not be the end of him in sprints. “I gave it my best but my body did not respond. However, we will live to fight another day. The fight is still on and we will continue training hard as we await future opportunities,” he said. “The race was tough and my opponents were for sure not here to joke but we move on regardless. This will not be the end for me, I am going back to the drawing board to work on the mistakes I made and I will be back before you know it,” he added. The  African Championships 400m bronze medalist was eager to make a debut at Oregon but his hopes were cut short with Emmanuel Kipkurui Korir clocking 44.87 secs to win the race. Boniface Mweresa clocked 45.79 secs to finish second while Kennedy Kimeu posted 46.38 secs for third place. Kelvin Kiprotic Tonui completed the top four places in 46.58 secs. Omae had started his season well with a win at National Championships and Kip Keino Classic, where he was second in 46.03 secs. Prior to the trials, Omae had been training with a South African coach and was optimistic about making the Oregon team.
