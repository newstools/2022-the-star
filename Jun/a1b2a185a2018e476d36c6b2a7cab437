Cycling team INEOS Grenadiers have teamed up with marathon world-record holder Eliud Kipchoge to set up a cycling academy in Kenya as they look to tap into the renowned endurance of the local talent and create top-level cyclists. Along with Dutch sports management agency Global Sports Communication, the new academy called the INEOS Eliud Kipchoge Cycling Academy will be set up at Kaptagat camp where Kipchoge’s Running Team training centre is located. “We work with the great potential of East African long-distance runners for over 30 years,” head of the academy Valentijn Trouw said. “We believe the exceptional local endurance talent combined with the great training environment at Kaptagat will be perfect for developing quality cyclists.” African cycling made a breakthrough last month when Eritrea’s Biniam Girmay became the first Black African rider to win a Grand Tour stage at the Giro d’Italia. “We all know the talent is there - we saw it recently when Biniam Girmay made history by winning a stage at the Giro d’Italia,” INEOS Grenadiers team principal Dave Brailsford said. “I saw it first-hand in the inspiring young athletes I met in Kaptagat.”
