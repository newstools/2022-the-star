Police in Nairobi want candidates seeking elective seats to always inform them of their planned meetings for their own safety. Nairobi police boss James Mugera said they had noticed a trend where opponents raid meetings leading to destruction of property and injuries. He said it is upon the conveners of such meetings to liaise with them for their rallies to be secured. He said this affects all candidates campaigning in the city. Mugera cited an incident in Embakasi East where supporters of MP Babu Owino and his competitor Michael Ogada engaged in bloody confrontations on many occasions. He said they arrested two supporters of one of the candidates and recovered crude weapons. "The two are masterminds of the violence being witnessed there and we are looking for more suspects," he said. Campaigns are in top gear ahead of the August 9 general election. “Security is key in your meeting and we need to cooperate to ensure you are safe. Take your time to inform the police to be aware of the same,” he said. Police say their analysis shows similar situations have been reported in Ruaraka, Mathare, Kasarani and Roysambu constituencies. Mugera said they have mobilised more personnel to ensure they cover most of the meetings once alerted in advance. Police headquarters had canceled leaves for all officers and stopped further transfers to enable them to focus on the campaign, election day and post-poll period. Deputy Inspector General of police Edward Mbugua ordered the freeze of the movements in an internal memo on June 3. “Officers whose deployment/transfer has been sanctioned from this headquarters should now not be released to their new stations until after the general election,” he said. He said their transfer or deployment will remain as per their deployment signals but their departure to new stations will be done after the polls. This follows concerns that police movements ahead of the polls may affect planning and security. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
