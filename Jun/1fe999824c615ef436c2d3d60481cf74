Equity Bank donated 50,000 tree seedlings in Embu to bolster environment conservation. The trees were distributed to government institutions and schools after a diocesan education Sunday service presided by Bishop David Muriithi at St Mary's Girls Kiangima. The exercise was led by Mayfair branch business growth and development manager Eugene Busolo. Busolo said the bank donated the tree seedlings to make the environment better for residents. He said Equity is committed to planting 35 million trees in the country, to boost the 10 per cent forest cover target. "We are aggressively involved in tree planting and we are reaching out to churches and schools to meet our target," Busolo said. The official said the bank is also encouraging use of alternative green energy over traditional wood fuel, to protect forests. The National Environmental Management Authority says Kenya has 7.4 per cent forest cover, falling short of 3.6 per cent to reach 10 per cent by end of 2022. Nema says decreasing forest cover levels have been catalysed by cutting down of trees for charcoal burning. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
