Leaders APS Bomet will look to consolidate their position at the summit of the National Super League (NSL) when they face Zoo Kericho at Silibwet Stadium on Saturday. Bomet sit pretty at the apex of the table with 57 points, three above second-placed Fortune Sacco. Any hopes Zoo had of bouncing back to the Kenyan Premier League seem to be fizzling out by the day as they slump further down the table. They are eighth on the log with 41 points. Fortune Sacco will be traveling to Moi Stadium, Kisumu for their tie against Muhoroni Youth. After kicking off the season on a high, Muhoroni have managed to maintain the required momentum. Muhoroni have shown every intention of reclaiming their status in top-flight football and currently place third with 51 points. A win might just as well propel them to the second spot depending on how Fortune fare in their assignment. Dandora Love (formerly Mount Kenya) host Coastal Heroes in the bottom of the table clash at Camp Toyoyo in Nairobi. Both sides are relegation candidates with Heroes second from the bottom with 24 points and Dandora at the tail end of the table with a paltry 19 points. MCF face Silibwet at Wundanyi Stadium. Whereas MCF are seventh with 44 points, Silibwet are 15th with 35. Shabana host Migori Youth at Gusii Stadium. Whereas Shabana are fifth with 46 points, Migori are 13th with 35. Kisumu All-Stars will flex muscles with Gusii United at Moi Stadium Kisumu. Kisumu who have experienced dwindling fortunes since their relegation from the country's top tier two seasons ago are 16th with 32 points. Gusii, on the other hand, are 17th with 28. Mombasa Elite face Assad at Serani Sports Ground. Elite are ninth with 41 while Assad place 14th with 35. Murang'a Seal host Vihiga United at St. Sebastian Park, Githuri. Murang'a are 10th with 40 and Vihiga 12th with 37. Mara Sugar face Mwatate at Wundanyi Stadium in Taveta.
