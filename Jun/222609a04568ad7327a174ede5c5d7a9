The Green belt movement has decried massive destruction of forests in Trans Nzoia county’s water tower of Mount Elgon. The Movement’s chairperson Jane Gitau said though residents have been trained in managing the forest, nothing seems to change in conservation. Speaking at the Kimothon forest on Saturday during a tree planting exercise, Ms Gitau said it was worrying that the destruction of indigenous trees was increasing. "It is worrying seeing those entrusted with planting and conservation of forests burning trees. We should stop and rethink the dangers that may befall humanity if we continue like this," Gitau said. "I  believe the way they are cutting down the trees is shameful. Burning of the tree trunks has led to massive destruction which shouldn’t be condoned." County conservator George Abuto thanked the GBM for its commitment towards planting indigenous trees in the region. He asked other stakeholders to emulate GBM to help Kenya achieve more than 10 per cent forest cover. "Much of the water that goes to Lake Victoria and other parts of this country emanates from the mountain where we are planting trees today. Other stakeholders are encouraged to join Green Belt in its endeavor to make the country green," he said. He put on notice all those involved in illegal logging of the indigenous forests. "We will remain watchful against those destroying our forests. With the help of the Kenya Forests Service guards and scouts we will be catching up with mischievous loggers destroying our forests," he said. The tree planting exercise according to the programme manager had more than 5 million indigenous trees planted in Kimothon, Suam and Kiptogot forests for three years. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
