Uniformed disciplined forces have been urged to exercise maximum professionalism during and after the electioneering period for a peaceful and united country. National coordinator for discipline service chaplaincy Peter Kimani said security officers should focus on promoting peace, and unity and embrace fairness in discharging their duties in the country. As police officers, Kimani said they should commit their work before God for guidance to help them discharge their mandates effectively and professionally. "Our call is to kill the enmity and not the enemy.  We must always discharge our duties in regard." He spoke during a thanksgiving service for the uniformed disciplined services from Kisumu and Siaya counties at St. Theresa's Catholic Cathedral Kibuye on Sunday. The Kenya National Police Service, National Youth Service, Kenya Wildlife Services, Directorate of Criminal Investigations and Kenya Prisons attended the service. Kimani, who presided over the service, told disciplined officers to abide by the oath they took during their pass out from the training. "We must remain non-partisan when carrying out our daily duties for effective service delivery to citizens," he said. He noted that the security officers require prayers to guide them during their duties. Kimani said that even though the officers are armed, they must seek God's guidance during their work. "They need God to guide them in their decision-making to protect them as they go out to serve Kenyans," he said. Kimani said a similar annual thanksgiving service is ongoing in different parts of the country.
