Roots Party presidential candidate Prof George Wajackoyah says he rocks a durag as a sign of protest against corruption in Kenya. Speaking during an interview with Citizen TV, Wajackoyah spoke about his humble beginnings. "I am a former street boy, a grave digger," he said. "I have children and a wife who live in the US, my kids live in the US. This durag is a protest against corruption. When African Americans were taken in as slaves. "A lot of them died on the ship. They were told to throw the dead people into the water. "Before doing so, they would tear the clothes of the dead and tie them as a durag on the head. The number of durags showed the number of people who had died." A durag is a close-fitting cloth tied around the top of the head to protect the hair. Similarly, a wave cap is a close-fitting cap for the same purpose. Wajackoyah said he is not ready to quit wearing it as he is more comfortable in his current outfits. "This is my dress mode. I have suits but I am more comfortable in casual clothing." He was cleared by IEBC to vie for the presidency alongside his running mate Justina Wamae. The duo shared their agenda with the electorate, and the legalisation and planting of marijuana for commercial purposes dominated the interview. He told Trevor Ombija that he will launch the party's manifestos on July 2.
