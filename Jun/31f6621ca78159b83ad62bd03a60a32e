Hosts Kenyatta University crushed to a 2-0 defeat against Makerere University at the ongoing 10th Federation of African University Sports games. KU, who started off their campaign on Monday with a 1-0 win over Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Guinee, Conakry must now tread carefully in their next game. “If you look at today’s game, it was the toughest. We gave a good account of ourselves and were in the game until the penalty came,” said KU coach and former international Tobias ‘Jua Kali’ Ochola. “After the break, we pressed for an equaliser only to concede again. Our focus is on the semis. We have a chance to proceed but we have to win our next game with a clean sheet.” The Ugandans scored their opener in 33rd minute through a penalty by Wataikire Raymond and Saudi Muir superbly nodded home from a corner in the 87th minute. A total of 14 universities from 40 countries across the continent are competing in the five-day show opened on Monday by the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta.
