In this cold season colds, coughs, and sore throats are becoming quite common. If you have been hit by cough and cold already in this changing season, try consuming pineapple juice to soothe your throat and nose. As a fruit with benefits, pineapple is sometimes highly underrated. A 2010 study found that pineapple juice is part of an effective treatment for tuberculosis. The researchers found its ability to soothe the throat and dissolve mucus helped a lot. They suggested that a mixture of pineapple juice, honey, salt, and pepper reduced cough symptoms up to five times faster than over-the-counter (OTC) cough syrup. The fruit is high in vitamin C which improves the quality of our skin and is a great immunity booster. It also has the enzyme bromelain which helps tackle the inflammation that happens when we have flu or cold. The fruit has other amazing benefits such as helping in digestion, easing symptoms of arthritis due to its inflammatory nature and it may protect you from certain cancers. Ensure if you are taking medications, consult your healthcare provider or registered dietitian to make sure it’s safe to consume pineapple juice.
