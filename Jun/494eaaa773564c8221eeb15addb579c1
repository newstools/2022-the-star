Bunyore Starlets coach Daniel Arunga believes his players will have to do the unthinkable, sinking an unbeaten Vihiga Queens in their quest to avoid the drop as the Women’s Premier League concludes on Snday. Vihiga thrashed Bunyore 3-0 in the reverse fixture but Arunga insists they have a chance against the champions in this must-win fixture. Bunyore are on a seven-match winless run but Arunga hopes playing in front of their fans will inspires the players to shift the gears towards retaining their WPL status. Bunyore are in a three-way relegation fight alongside Kayole and Kisumu All Starlets. Kisumu are ninth with 20 points, one better of Bunyore at 10th. Kayole, who had their previous match — against Trans-Nzoia Falcons ­— rescheduled due to a last-minute change of venue, have 16. “The girls are upbeat ahead of the encounter,” said Arunga. “Anything can happen in football. We are not yet out and we shall fight to the last whistle. We find ourselves in this unfamiliar territory due to the numerous challenges we have faced.” “We have to break Vihiga’s unbeaten run by all means. That is the only way we can retain our top-flight status. There’s no shortcut. All in all, it will be an explosive match. Playing against the champions with the kind of ballooning pressure we are facing isn’t the easiest of assignments  but we will put our best foot forward.” Two of the teams will join the already relegated Kangemi Ladies who, despite having second best WPL top-scorer Fasila Adhiambo in their ranks, will play in the Division One League next season. Bunyore will have to keep top-scorer Topista Situma (15 goals) at bay if they are to get a result. Unfortunately for Bunyore, they will miss their top scorer, Susan Malda (eight goals) due to a knee injury that has kept her out in the team’s three previous encounters. “We have to find solutions upfront. We need to score goals if we are to win,” he concluded.
