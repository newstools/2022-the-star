Agricultural organization Yara East Africa on Thursday introduced YaraVita SeedLift to cereal farmers in the North Rift counties and its environs. The seed lift is expected to help increase crop resiliency given the ever-changing climate. Speaking during the Yara SeedLift farmers’ field day, Yara Kenya Manager, William Ngeno, acknowledged the importance of building farmers’ capacity through knowledge sharing. “We have established various Centers of Excellence across the country. The objective of these hubs is to share Yara’s best practice tips on sustainable crop nutrition and soil health, through the setting up of crop demonstrations, in which farmers learn from the experienced agronomy at the key stages of crop development," he said. Ngeno added that YaraVita SeedLift improves uptake efficiencies of applied basal and foliar fertilizers, which supports crops flourishment and resilience against unpredictable weather patterns. He said good crop nutrition encourages the multiplication of micro-organisms and provides additional nutrients needed for good rooting, leaf development and flowering. “Our aim as Yara is to equip the farmers with knowledge that helps them grow and increase their yields and profit base. We also provide quality fertilizer inputs to the last mile that are easily accessible and affordable for the smallholder and large-scale farmer,” he added. The YaraVita SeedLift program can be used by maize, sorghum, barley, wheat, beans and rice farmers as a seed dresser that provides resistance to drought, heat and chemical stress while improving the nutrition, quantity and quality of crop yield. This program enables the crop to have an optimum population as it improves seed germination thus promoting high yields and thus high sales returns.
