Deputy William Ruto on Saturday hit the campaign trail immediately after being cleared, promising to make life bearable for Kenyans if elected on August 9. Ruto said his Kenya Kwanza government will prioritise cutting the cost of living, saying millions of Kenyans are suffering. Speaking at South C in Nairobi’s Langata Constituency, the DP said he will put taxpayers' money into labour-intensive projects as opposed to capital intensive ventures to address the runaway unemployment amongst the youths. “We will put money where it will reduce the cost of living,” Ruto said. He was accompanied by his running mate Rigathi Gachagua, Kenya kwanza leaders Musalia Mudavadi, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Alfred Mutua, Johnson Sakaja, Amason Kingi and Millicent Omanga. Rigathi drummed up support for Kenya kwanza, saying they have the solution to the country’s high cost of living. “The journey to address the high cost of living has begun today,” Mudavadi said. Mudavadi told off those he claimed were peddling lies that the DP will not be on the ballot, saying they should be ready for a Ruto presidency. “Those peddling lies that Ruto will not be on the ballot, the die is cast, and there is no turning back,” he said. Ruto is expected to make several stopovers in the City and later, address a major rally at the historic Kamukunji grounds. The DP will address rallies at South B, Mukuru, City Stadium, Gikomba, Majengo and finally Kamukunji.
