Zuchu's older brother Black Kopa, who is preparing to release his EP, has no qualms about her marrying Diamond. Speaking to Bona TV in Tanzania, he however said he doubts there is anything going on. "She is free to live her life. The most important thing is that she is doing her music successfully, mambo mengine hayo ya mapenzi ni mambo ya mtu," he said. What if Zuchu wants to marry Diamond Platnumz?  Would he bless their union? "Yes, I will, if that's what their plan is. Our mother Khadija has always encouraged us to marry the one and that if he or she is the one, go ahead and marry them," he said. "Our mother says we must choose a partner we love and will be comfortable with because it is you who will face problems; for instance, if they decide to slap you. So the only thing I will ask her is, 'Umekagua vizuri?' If she says yes, then I support her." Asked if he has a message for his future brother-in-law Diamond, he laughed. "I don't have anything to say to him. He is an adult and knows what he is doing. Even Zuchu, I have nothing to tell her. Sitaki kuongelea kitu chochote, mtu namaisha yake she will talk about it if she wants, I can't talk about her personal business. " The brother sings taarab music but this time round has tried bongo flavour music. Asked why he hasn't collaborated with his baby sister yet, he said, "Maybe in future. Right now she is under a label, and while there we must respect the record label until she is free of obligations."
