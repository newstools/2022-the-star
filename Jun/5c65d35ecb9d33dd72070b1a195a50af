Drama and music festivals have resumed in institutions of higher learning, two years since closure. Since the onset of Covid-19, the ministry of education suspended all co-curricular activities in schools, from primary, and secondary to higher learning institutions. The first festival was held at Kenyatta University's Kitui campus bringing together seven universities. Speaking during the event, university education PS Simon Nabukwesi thanked the students for showcasing talent through various avenues. Nabukwesi said their commitment has seen up-scaling of the quality of the presentations made. “University students are our mirror for the future; you are tomorrow’s drivers of the economy in various strategic positions,” Nabukwesi said. The PS appreciated the varsity heads for availing resources for the enhancement of talent. “This investment which is geared towards the development of talents in performing arts has a long and sustainable payback to you and the nation,” he said. He also mentioned the role of drama and festivals in the implementation of the Competency-Based Curriculum. "We are also going to pay particular attention to ICT as a very critical subject of study as well as a tool for curriculum delivery," he added. Paul Okemo who represented KU VC Paul Wainaina appreciated the students for their creative performance. Okemo noted that there was so much useful display and lessons to learn for both the young and the old from all the performances. The Chairman of Central and Eastern Universities Regional Drama Festival Emmanuel Shikuku called for networking forums. Shikuku said this ensures that the Kenyan students benefit and earn from their talents. He wanted especially the State Department for University and Research to work closely with the Kenya National drama festival.
