Gospel singer Daddy Owen will open a children's home for the disabled people in Eldoret. While announcing the plans to his fans, Owen shared the progress of the almost complete building on Instagram. He announced that the project will be launched in August. Inspection is underway and official information on launch dates will be shared soon. "Rather than just being human, be a humanitarian," he said. "My purpose in life is to help persons with disabilities, more so children with disabilities." Owen has been active in helping disabled children who need corrective surgeries. Every year, Owen holds the Malaika Tributes awards to celebrate the unsung heroes. He said the event reminds him of the stigma he went through after he lost one of his eyes in 2002.
