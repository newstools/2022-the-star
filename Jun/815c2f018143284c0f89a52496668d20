As a way of providing more age appropriate experiences, Instagram has said it will be testing new options for users to verify their age. In addition to allowing users to upload their (ID) identity proof which will be deleted after 30 days, Instagram said it has partnered with Yoti, a company that specialises in online age verification to ensure users' privacy. “We require people to be at least 13 years old to sign up for Instagram. In some countries, our minimum age is higher. When we know if someone is a teen (13-17), we provide them with age-appropriate experiences like defaulting them into private accounts, preventing unwanted contact from adults they don’t know and limiting the options advertisers have to reach them with ads,” they said in a blog. In addition to someone uploading their ID, they are also testing two new ways to verify a person’s age. If you choose this option, you’ll see instructions on your screen to guide you. After you take a video selfie, they will share the image with Yoti, and nothing else. Yoti’s technology will estimate your age based on your facial features and share that estimate with us. “Meta and Yoti will delete the image after verification. The technology cannot recognise your identity just your age,” The person vouching must be at least 18 years old, must not be vouching for anyone else at that time and will need to meet other safeguards we have in place. The three people you select to vouch for you will receive a request to confirm your age and will need to respond within three days. The test run is currently in the US, before being rolled out to other users worldwide.
