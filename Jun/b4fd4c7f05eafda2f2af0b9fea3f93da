National handball women's champions Nairobi Water Queens are determined to successfully defend their two titles this season. Coach Jack Ochieng revealed that the new players he signed are gelling well with the rest of the squad and the prospects look good. "We are trying to work on our speed and strengthening our defence tactics." He is aware the task is not easy because his girls remain the target of all the top contenders who also have respectable players. Water Queens who are also the regional champions have remained unbeaten in their four national league matches. The title race started on June 11 with a 36-16 victory over Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat). The Water Queens who have a weekend assignment against Rangers registered easy wins over Nairobi City Council (53-9), New Hope (55-5), and whipped Amazon (43-5). Queens' toughest rivals in the local scenes remain Ulinzi Sharks and National Cereals and Produce Board.
