Manchester City teenager Shea Charles wants many more Northern Ireland caps after making his international debut against Greece. The 18-year-old came on in the 79th minute of the 1-0 loss to the Greeks in their opening Nations League match. Charles, who replaced George Saville in midfield but can also play at center-back, knows what he is going to do with his shirt from his debut on Thursday. “I’m going to frame my shirt and put it in my room,” he said. “I hope I can just push on from here and get more caps. It was a great feeling to make my debut. “Obviously with the loss it is a low, but it is also a big high. The manager just told me to go on and do my thing, really, in a defensive midfield role. “I’ve been at Windsor Park before to watch a game but obviously that was my first time playing here and the fans were great. “I didn’t expect to be playing in this game but I will take every chance as it comes.” Manchester-born Charles has played for Northern Ireland at under-19 and under-21 level, and trained with the City first team, though he is yet to make an appearance under Pep Guardiola. He has enjoyed working closely with internationals such as Spain’s Rodri and Brazilian Fernandinho, but is unsure if he will go out on loan next season. “We will see what happens next year, but we will see how training is going. I will just take each game as it comes,” he added. “When we train with the (City) first team the standard is so high and we are always learning, every day. “With the likes of Rodri and Fernandinho, it is tough but enjoyable. You learn a lot from the whole team and obviously the coaches as well.”
