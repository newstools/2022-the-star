He noted that the government is keen to empower more youths noting that the COVID-19 pandemic pushed many out of their jobs. Speaking after launching the program, he called upon the youth who will be successful to dedicate their time and carry out the duties as assigned by the government. “We still have a number of young people out there who needs this job, hence when they get them. Let them work according to the set rules and conditions." The commissioner also directed the supervisor to strike out from the roll those who will be lazing around to give room to those in the waiting bay. “I want to ask those who will be enlisted to ensure they use the money for economic use and not put them in drug and alcohol use." He also urged the youths to desist from being used during the electioneering period to orchestrate violence. “On August 9th we will be doing elections and we don’t want you to be used to bringing chaos. That day you will go and vote, but on August 10th, we want to see you continue with the Kazi Mtaani work." The youth will be expected to take part in cleaning drainage's, planting trees and clearing bushes within the localities.
