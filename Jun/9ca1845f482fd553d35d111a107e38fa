Meru men have been urged to acquire skills in technical training institutes. The Deputy Director, TVET/Project Coordinator John Tuwei on Tuesday said he was shocked by the low enrollment of men in TVETs. Only 326 males out of 846 graduated from Mukiria Technical Training Institute. Caroline Muguna, Mukiria Technical Principal, and institution's Board chairman Albert Kobia called on parents to enlighten their children to acquire necessary skills. The two also appealed to the Education Ministry to provide the institute with land for expansion and practical training. The institution sitting on only a two acres piece of land has inadequate staff forcing the Board of governance to use more funds on the wage bills in recruiting suitable trainers at the expense of building workshops and buying equipment. "It was a youth polytechnic in 2014 but now it has more than 3000 trainees. It sits on 2.4 acres of land. Our trainees do their practicals in neighbours’ homes or on Kaguru farm. Ball games are practised at Kariene primary, Nyweri, Abuthuguchi primary and even on the tamarack road. We appeal for more land, workshops, equipment and trainers," Muguna said. Speaking during the institute's second graduation ceremony where 846 trainees acquired certificates in different skills, Muguna said her students especially, the Agriculture one, are forced to conduct practicals in neighbourhood private or government farms. “Without a skill like masonry, plumbing, carpentry and others in this country, one is in great problem. “Be very serious with life and not bother about the certificate paper issued. Think of what you acquired and use it to earn and not go stay with your mother at home. Nations that resisted technology are very behind today," Kobia said. Tuwei, who represented PS Margret Mwakima said he will present the request to the ministry for action. Margret Ndiyiu, the Meru county TVET director told the graduands to demonstrate whatever acquired to solve the society's problems.
