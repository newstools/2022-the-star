Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has said the government will not shut down the internet during elections. In the past weeks, the Kenyan campaigns have been hot on the heels with politicians claiming there is an attempt to interfere with elections through the ICT ministry. Matiang'i claimed that they have been accused of all manner of things. ”… but this will not tempt us to retrogressive steps like shutting down the internet during the elections as we respect the rights of all,” he said on Wednesday evening. "We are approaching elections and the biggest debate is about how we are going to behave with each other in the era of fake news and the unprecedented abuse of social media.” He said the government is not going to act otherwise adding that the government respects the freedom of Kenyans. “No amount of insults or criticism will tempt the government enough to resort to retrogressive acts of interfering with freedoms of Kenyans."
