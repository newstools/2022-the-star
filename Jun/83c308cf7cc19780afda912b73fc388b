Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja has numerous times stated that he is a graduate of the University of Nairobi. In an interview with Churchill Show in June last year, Sakaja said he studied Actuarial Science at the UoN. A letter from the University of Nairobi Deputy Vice-Chancellor Julius Ogeng'o to the Director of Criminal Investigations dated May 31, 2021, confirms otherwise. The letter confirms that indeed Sakaja was and is still a student of UoN. "He undertook the programme "Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science" at the university for four years from  2003/2004 to 2007/2008," Ogeng'o said in the letter, seen by the Star, to the DCI. Ongeng'o, however, revealed that the Senator never graduated from the university as there is no record in the graduation booklet confirming that. On the completion of his studies, Ong'engo said: " Records available indicate that he did not complete his studies". The university also responded to queries about alleged transcripts claimed to belong to Sakaja while he was at the University of Nairobi. "The attached copies of academic transcripts are incomplete and not signed by officers  of this university." Sakaja is eyeing the Nairobi governor seat and a degree is a mandatory requirement for anyone seeking a governor seat. The Star has learnt that the Senator presented a Ugandan university, Team University, certificate for clearance to vie for Nairobi governor.
