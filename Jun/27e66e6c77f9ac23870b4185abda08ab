It is now emerging that Tusker head coach Robert Matano is unhappy despite steering the side to a second consecutive Kenyan Premier League title on Sunday. As his charges and the rest of the technical bench took to euphoric celebration after their landmark win, Matano was venting out his profound frustrations right in front of inquisitive journalist who proded him further. Addressing the media immediately after their crunch tie against Posta Rangers at Ruaraka Complex in Nairobi, Matano disclosed that an influential team official (name withheld) was working behind the scenes to have him fired. “There is someone who doesn't want me in the team. But I'm happy I finally proved him wrong by winning the title. I understand my coaching role very well and it's not by sheer luck that I've won titles. I've mastered my job very well,” Matano said. Matano said the official had formed a habit of castigating him each time the team's performance fell way below expectations. “Unfortunately, there are people who don't trust me. I shouldn't be crucified when the team is down. Football is full of dynamics and there are days the team won't be performing well. But at the end of the day it's a marathon and what's important is the final outcome. Matano insinuated he would consider bolting away should push come to shove. “One would rather feed on unfried Kale in a friendly and conducive environment than having fried chicken in a hostile one,” Matano said.
