Residents of  Kachibora in Trans Nzoia East in Trans Nzoia County are in shock after the body of a 39 -year-old-man was found dangling from the roof of his house following disagreements with his wife. The man identified as  David Kipliman Kiprono committed suicide after his wife Winnie Mulongo Wanyama said no to his request to have her identification card used to purchase a motorcycle on loan. Area village elder Samuel Kariuki told the Star the deceased came home at around 11: 00 am and found his wife and her children asleep and tried stabbing them. The wife, he said, raised an alarm which attracted the neighbours who rushed to the house and disarmed the man. He further noted that the man who seemed to be undergoing some psychological torture got infuriated by his wife’s refusal to give him her identification card hence his decision to try and kill her and her children. "The villagers here have confirmed that indeed the couple had tumultuous times full of disagreements from time to time. It is said that the woman has been left on her own with the children," he said. The village elder said the man rushed to his house after villagers prevented him from stabbing his wife for the second time. "He rushed to his house and for him to be prevented from coming out the villagers closed the door from outside and alerted the police,"  he said. The village manager said the man hang himself using a rope after the villagers stopped the man to escape through a hole he had managed to dig in his mud-walled house. Police officers from the DCI and the scenes of crime processed the scene and took away the body of the deceased to Kitale county referral hospital mortuary awaiting postmortem. Trans Nzoia County Criminal Investigations Officer Francis Kihara told the Star the deceased had been involved in several criminal activities.
