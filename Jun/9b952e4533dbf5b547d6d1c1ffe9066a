Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o has been cleared by IEBC to defend his seat in the August 9 General Election. Nyong'o was cleared alongside his deputy Mathews Owili at Tom Mboya Labour College on Friday. According to Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Returning Officer Solomon Mudanya, the commission had gazetted eight candidates but only six candidates stepped forward to pick their nomination forms. Nyong'o was the first aspirant in the Kisumu governor race to be cleared by IEBC. Former Governor Jack Ranguma of the MDG party will appear before the commission's chief on Monday. While presenting his papers, Nyong'o was accompanied by leaders from the county, including MPs Nyikal James (Seme), Koyoo James (Muhoroni), and Aduma Owuor (Nyakach), among others. While addressing the media, Nyong'o said Raila stands for the unity of the nation and the unity must begin from Kisumu County. He noted that every Kisumu citizen must vote solidly for candidates in Azimio. "In Kisumu County, the ruling party is ODM which will play a principal role in ensuring Azimio forms the next government." Chege said that as a member of the council in Azimio, she is happy that Nyong'o has been cleared and ready to serve Kisumu for a second term. "I also want to congratulate all the MPs who have been cleared by IEBC. As Azimio, we will embrace them and support them all way through." "We are fully behind Baba. We fully support and embrace him, hence, I call upon people from this region to come out in large numbers on that day and vote for Raila."
