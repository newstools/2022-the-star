APS Bomet consolidated their position at the helm of the National Super League (NSL) log after their top of the table clash against Fortune Sacco ended in a barren draw at Kianyaga grounds on Saturday. The home team enjoyed numerical advantage for the better part of the match after APS Bomet's Rama Kenga was sent for an early shower following a grave infringement. Elsewhere, Kibera Black Stars thumped a hapless Dandora Love 3-1. Seasoned defender Pascal Ogweno opened the floodgates in the 22nd minute before Francis Wahuru doubled the advantage in the 45th minute. Nigerian forward Derima Maija then found the back of the net in the 66th minute to put the match beyond doubt. Relegation-bound Coastal Heroes held Silibwet Leons to 2-2 draw at Mbaraki Stadium. MCF netted goals in each half to register a comfortable 2-0 win over trouble-ridden Kisumu All Stars. Kisii-based Shabana edged SS Assad 1-0 at Shamu grounds. Editing by Tony Mballa
