Tanzanian singer Hamisa Mobetto has shut down claims she underwent surgery to enlarge her behind. In an interview with Wasafi Media, Hamisa said she had always been thick. She said in a past interview that doing cosmetic surgery to lift her behind is not a big deal. "Everybody does that, ma celebrities in America wanafanya. Kwa hiyo it’s the same case. Siku ikitokea nimefanya, definitely, I will tell you." Hamisa admitted she has a collabo with American rapper Rick Ross but declined to speak about her relationship with the rapper. "I have never put my relationship in public. It just happens that people find out. I don’t have such history." Rick Ross said in a recent Instagram Live that he is dating Hamisa. "They wanna know if we are dating? Yes, she is mine."
