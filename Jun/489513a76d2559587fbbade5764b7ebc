At least six people are feared dead following a ghastly road accident involving a Garissa Bus and a personal car along the Mwingi-Thika highway. Of the seven, six died on the spot while one died while being rushed to hospital for medication. Six people who died were the personal car occupants. Lower Yatta deputy County Commissioner Rebecca Ndiragu confirmed the accident and the death of the six. It happened between Kanyonyoo and Kivandini markets. The road is said to be under construction and has been posing danger to road users. The accident comes barely a week after multiple road accidents that claimed several lives were reported across the country. On Saturday, 12 people perished in a road accident in Kitui while on their way to a dowry negotiation ceremony. The scene of the Saturday accident is a few kilometres from where the six people lost their lives on Tuesday. The accident happened when a 14-seater Matatu they were travelling in veered off the road and rolled several times at Kanyonyoo in Kitui. Ndirangu said nine people died on the spot and two others succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment at Kitui Level 5 hospital. The accident happened at around 9.30 pm. On Monday, five lives were lost after a train rammed into a lorry ferrying workers of a construction company in Ruiru, Kiambu county.
