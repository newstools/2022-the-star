Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga on Sunday traded jabs with his main competitor Deputy President William Ruto over the chaos that marred the UDA candidate's rally at Jacaranda Grounds. This followed accusations by the DP that the ODM leader was behind the chaos that rocked the event leading to the injury of five people. While speaking at the Jacaranda event, Ruto said no amount of intimidation and stone throwing will stop the change in the country. He later took his attacks online, calling Raila "the lord of violence" and  "father of violence" in a tweet. Ruto claimed Raila "hired desperate and jobless youths" that pelted his convoy with stones. "What a shame on fathers day Mr father of violence. Freedom is coming Aug 9th," Ruto said. In his response to the accusations, the ODM leader said Ruto was seeking sympathy votes by blaming everyone over every misfortune that befalls him. "It’s not okay to be rudderless, clueless and plan-less. This country is slowly overcoming fraudsters and shortcuts that define your politics," Raila said. "Maliza uende. There is no room for sympathy votes," he added. The DP on Sunday weathered chaos and stone throwing youths and stormed the historic Jacaranda Grounds after a bid to block him failed. Police had cancelled the event citing intelligence reports that goons had planned to cause chaos. All the while, youths allied to Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza and Raila's Azimio battled outside for hours. Ruto's car was pelted with stones as he made his way into the venue after a meeting of top police officers resolved to allow the rally to proceed despite area MP Babu Owino claiming to have booked the same venue. Five people were injured in the melee, including the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) candidate in the Embakasi East election, Francis Mureithi.
