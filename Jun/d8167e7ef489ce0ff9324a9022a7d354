Mombasa Sports Club captain Mariano Emadau has called on teammates to stay focused and work hard in training as they seek to arrest their woeful run during the second leg of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League. The coastal side are languishing at the bottom of the 10-team league with one point from nine matches. The league returnees are winless thus far and have failed to rediscover the form that saw them make a grand return to the top tier in 2020. "It's not just going back to the drawing board but we have to accept the fact that things haven't gone as planned. Our struggles this season are down to a concentration lapse, especially in the closing stages of our matches," said Emadau. "We have to toughen up mentally. We must also avoid looking at the table. We have lost matches that we should have easily won and things won't get any easier in the second half of the season." Emadau said MSC's inexperience could be taking a toll on the squad but added that should not be an excuse. "We have learnt how tough the league is. The team has failed to deliver both home and away but such experiences will only make us better," added Amadau. "We are not used to playing on the astroturf and maybe that is where our opponents hold a slight advantage."
