Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has said his administration will introduce last mile internet should he win the August polls. The DP said the project will be a model of Jubilee's last mile power connectivity project which sought to connect all households to the national grid across the country. "Just like we had last mile for power, we will now introduce last mile for internet," Ruto said. He spoke on Wednesday during the launch of the Kiambu County Hustlers Fund in Kiambu county. He said the internet connection will follow last mile's grid and ensure every house, school, market or social amenity with power has internet. The last mile project has pushed Kenya's electricity access to 75 per cent. "We need around Sh38 billion to supply internet to every house," Ruto said. He explained that the availability of the internet will do away with the need for bundles for anyone who will need browsing services. "Many people are having trouble with bundles. You will no longer need bundles to make calls," Ruto said. Back on the Hustler fund, Ruto said the fund will benefit youth, mama mboga, boda boda riders and start ups. He said beneficiaries will not need security to benefit from the fund. "The only guarantee we will require is for you to be a member of a cooperative or a sacco," Ruto said. He spoke on Wednesday during the launch of the Kiambu County Hustlers Fund. Ruto said other than setting up the fund, the Kenya Kwanza administration will also empower farmers and improve their productivity through provision of fertilisers seeds. This, he said, will cut across coffee, tea, avocado and dairy farming. "Where you are getting two bags, we want five bags. If it's dairy farming, a cow that produces five litres of milk we want 15 litres," Ruto said.
