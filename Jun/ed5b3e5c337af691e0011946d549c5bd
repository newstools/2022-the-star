Abel Mutua's wife Judy Nyawira is not happy about people asking her to get a second child. The couple has a 12-year-old daughter, Stephanie Mumbua. Speaking to SPM Buzz, Judy said she is okay with one child. "We closed that chapter, we are OK with just one child," she said. "Please those stupid questions that you people keep asking in the DM, eti ongeza mwingine, please those are stupid questions." Judy got pregnant while in college at the age of 22 years. "I was with Abel so I went and showed him the test results. That day I cried the whole day and 12 years later, we are here." She appreciates being a young mum but does not advise anyone to follow her steps.
