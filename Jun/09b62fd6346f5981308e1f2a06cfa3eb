Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will carry the day in Vihiga in the August elections, ODM chairman Vihiga branch Zebeddy Osabwa has said. Osabwa said they had done all it takes to ensure he wins the majority votes within Vihiga. “We are not here just to tell stories but we are on the reality. Those who want stories are free for that but we are on a mission to hunt for votes for Raila,” Osabwa said. He spoke to the Star on phone on Wednesday. Osabwa said ODM candidates within Vihiga will also win. “We want Baba to have enough foot soldiers within his party when he wins,” he said. Osabwa said other ODM candidates who will win include MP Chris Omulele for Luanda and Godfrey Osotsi for Senate among others. “Governor Wilber Ottichilo will win with a larger margin because he has campaigned properly,” he said. He said those who are expecting to meet Ottichilo at open rallies are wasting time saying the governor is campaigning strategically. Osabwa said what is needed in politics is numbers and that's what Ottichilo is going for. Ottichilo will battle for the seat with Governor Moses Akaranga, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, Senator George Khaniri and Francis Ominde. Ottichilo was elected in 2017 under the ODM party. “If we want to push the development agenda in this county, we must all invest, to create employment and end capital flight within the county,” he said.
