President Uhuru Kenyatta has convened a meeting of the 11 Azimio la Umoja Coalition party Council on Friday. The meeting which will be held at the Kenyatta International Convention center in Nairobi will be attended by the party's presidential candidate Raila Odinga and other leaders. The agenda of the meeting will be to review, formulate and approve party policies and review the party’s campaign strategy and plan. The meeting comes at a time when the Azimio team is pushing to build consensus among various candidates to have some step down for strong ones. The meeting will therefore approve a report on how the plan will be in executed ahead of the planned mass negotiations next week. This will be the second meeting of the coalition that he will be chairing. He chaired the first Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition council meeting at Kenyatta International Convention Centre in April. It was after the meeting that the top Council sanctioned a process to identify Raila's running mate ahead of the August 9 polls. The alliance's top organ tasked a panel to recommend possible persons for the second-highest position.
