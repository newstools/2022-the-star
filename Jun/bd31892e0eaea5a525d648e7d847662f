A school in Uganda has attracted the attention of many in the country not as a result of academic excellence or co-curricular activities, but because of the attire worn as the official uniform. In a report by Citizen Digital, villagers have been wondering why boys in the institution wear 'skirts' which is against their culture. Nyakasura School, a mixed boarding and day high school in Uganda's Western region, has male students wearing 'skirts' the skirts. According to the school's principal, the skirt-like attire is actually a kilt - a traditional Scottish men's attire. "People are misapprehending the concept behind their school attire , the skirt-like attire are  traditionally worn by men in the Scottish culture," the principal said. The school was founded in 1926 by Ernest William Calwell, a Scottish missionary who settled in the area during the colonial period  which explains the concept. The schools history is linked to Scotland and Cowell who introduced the culture which was not well embraced by locals. "The students in the school have understood the concept behind the dress code and no longer encounter culture shock," a form four student said. "Normally when I talk about my uniform and when they see students putting on a kilt. Most of the time they say that we are dressed like girls but for me I have no problem with it because I have live with it for four years," he added.
