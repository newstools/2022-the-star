Two people have been charged with undervaluing a consignment of hides and skin for export at the Port of Mombasa. David Ndile Ngunga and Bernadine Mwikali were presented before Mombasa resident magistrate Ritta Orora on Wednesday. They were charged with undervaluation to deny the government Sh2.8 million export duty. The products were being exported from Kenya to Nigeria. Ngunga and Mwikali are directors of Daybee Investments Limited. On August 24 last year, KRA Investigation and Enforcement Department received intelligence that the company was in the process of exporting two containers of hides and skins to Nigeria. The two containers were detained pending verification by a multi-agency team. Upon verification on September 7, 2021, in the presence of the exporter and clearing agent, it was established that the actual weights had been grossly undervalued. The weight of the containers had been declared as 5,000kg but was found to be 29,800kg and 30,500kg. The accused also faced an alternative charge of making a false declaration. They denied the charges and were released on Sh1 million bail. The case will be mentioned on June 29. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
