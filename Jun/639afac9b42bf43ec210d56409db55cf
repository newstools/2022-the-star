Deputy President condoled with the family of Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya following the death of his father, Mzee Mgala Mvurya Wanini. The DP termed Mzee Mgala as a great person who was a great inspiration to many. "The Kenya Kwanza Alliance is saddened by the passing of Mzee Mgala Mvurya Wanini. We have lost a father, a grandfather and an elder: a man of wisdom, a counsellor and a leader," he said in a tweet. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Governor Mvurya during this difficult time. May the Lord grant Mzee eternal rest." Mzee Mgala died at home on Wednesday after a short illness at Mavirivirini village in Kinango sub-county. The family is currently planning for his burial. He is set to be buried on Thursday at noon in accordance with Islamic rites. He died at the age of 83. Various national and county leaders are expected to attend the burial. Last year in August, Mvurya lost his mother Sada Mgalla. She died at the age of 75 years.
