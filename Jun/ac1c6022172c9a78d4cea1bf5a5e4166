Kenya Prisons women's volleyball team are spoiling for revenge in the national league after their dismal performance at the African Club Championship. The league is set to resume in October after the World Championships. The Wardresses finished fifth in the club's premier competition last month in Tunisia after coincidentally losing to Kenya Commercial Bank in the quarter-finals. Josp Barasa's charges succumbed to a 3-0 (25-17, 25-14, 25-14) to KCB for the first time in years at the continental club show. "That was our worst performance in a long time. We played an open game but reception and blocking really let us down. It was a wake-up call to the whole team that we have a long way to get back to our high levels," said Barasa. "We can only have a good season if we successfully defend the KVF title and we still have KCB and Pipeline to play. The two sides will face a totally different team as we want to lay down a marker and prove that we are still the team to beat. I don't want to call it revenge but we want our presence to be felt." The absence of the accomplished duo of setter Joy Luseneka and outside hitter Lydia Maiyo seems to have taken a toll on Prisons. The pair are away indefinitely due to family matters. New signings Sharon Sandui (libero) and budding setter Mackline Akoko have joined Kenya Prisons Service Training College as part of the rebuilding process. Barasa said they need to invest more in young talent to ensure continuity. "It is evident we have been reliant on experience for the last couple of years. We need to freshen up things and inject some fresh blood for competition purposes." The national women's league has been suspended indefinitely to give Malkia Strikers room to prepare for the quadrennial show slated for September 23 to October 15 in Netherlands and Poland.
