The Muslim community in Kisumu has appealed to ODM to give them three nominated MCA slots on the basis of marginalisation. Their memo was presented to the party through Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong’o by elder Hajj Hussein Farjala. They have proposed Shabban Kassim (Kisumu West), Mariam Abeid (Kisumu Central) and Salim Ombima (Kisumu East) for nominations. “We opine that with this proposal, each and every segment of our society will be represented equitably,” Farjala said. He said Kassim, Ombima and Abeid have been very active on matters of the Muslim community in Kisumu and who vied for various seats and lost. Farjala said the three also made the application to ODM National Elections Board for nomination consideration. He said the community has suffered the brunt of marginalisation since the country attained independence. “We acknowledge the struggles that Raila and other Kenyans have put forth to bring socio-economic and political liberation during and after the second liberation that culminated with the enactment of the 2010 Constitution,” Farjala said. Shabban has appealed to ODM members to give priority to those who participated in the nominations. He said the party’s constitution requires that such people be life members as a prerequisite for consideration for nomination. In the past, he said ODM exercised its discretion and offered seats to Aslam Khan and Farida Salim. Shabban vied for Central Kisumu ward during party nominations and lost. Abeid, who vied for Kaloleni Shaurimoyo ward, called on the party to consider those who were proposed by the community for nominations. “We want those who are well conversant with the plight of the community.”  (edited by Amol Awuor)
