Police in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, have launched investigations into the the cause of deaths of two inlaws whose bodies were found on Saturday morning. According to area police boss Daniel Kitavi, the bodies of Simon Muriithi,55, and Jane Waruguru, 50, were discovered by neighbours while on the verge of decomposing inside two separate houses within the same homestead. The OCPD told the Star on the phone that they suspect the two died either three or four days ago. "This morning we received a report from a village elder from Mwathani who informed us of two bodies that were discovered lying dead in two separate houses within the same homestead," he said. He revealed that the woman had suffered serious injuries on both her hands and legs while the man's body had minor injuries. "We have opened investigations into the circumstances surrounding their deaths in a bid to know who the perpetrators are and the motive behind the inhumane act." Police report indicated that the late Waruguru is said to have been living with her inlaws since her husband died about 3 years ago. Nothing much is known about the Muriithi's wife as she was nowhere to be found at the time of the discovery of the bodies. The discovery of the bodies threw the quiet village into shock and mourning as they demanded justice for the two. The neighbours expressed their shock over the incident, saying their village has never reported such a bizarre incident. They now want the authorities to hasten their investigations so as to bring to book the culprits. "The manner in which the two were murdered is very brutal and shocking to us. The two seem to have been killed while in their houses," said a neighbour. Another neighbour said the two were industrious in their respective casual jobs and lived in harmony with the villagers. "We want answers into what caused their deaths and this should not go unpunished." The bodies of the deceased were moved to Kerugoya Referral Hospital morgue awaiting postmortem.
