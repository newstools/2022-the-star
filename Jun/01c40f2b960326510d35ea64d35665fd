In this cold season, leather jackets are a go-to if we are looking for something stylish that can keep us warm. Getting a good leather jacket is a bit expensive and can cost you close to Sh3,000 or more, so, taking good care of them is the only way you can save your coins. Leather jackets are very delicate, try storing them in a clean dry place so that they do not get stained, get an unpleasant smell, or grow mould. If you want to clean a leather jacket correctly, do not use any kind of handy or clothes detergent, because leather is a gentle material. The trick is to use baby shampoo to clean a leather jacket or delicate soap with water. Use this trick and your leather jacket will look brand new. Some manufacturers provide cleaning specifications according to the type and grain of the leather, and any important warnings you need to know. You can visit your nearest supermarket and you will be advised on which leather cleaner to go for. Soft leather is very delicate, try and get a qualified leather expert at a dry cleaner who will have the knowledge and equipment to clean the most stubborn stains. This is by far the easiest way to clean your jacket. Dip your towel or sponge in the soapy solution then wring out the excess water. Ensure it is just dump because if it is too wet, the water can soak in and saturate the leather, potentially causing even more damage. Turn your jacket inside out and clean the lining. Hang the jacket inside out on a padded coat hanger to dry. Buy a leather conditioner and polish after cleaning. Also, avoid hanging it in direct sunlight. This is because real leather is animal skin and so it needs to be maintained and moisturized when it starts to dry out, it can eventually crack and peel.
