Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua on Thursday led campaigns in Moyale, Marsabit County. Raila reiterated his promise to end corruption if elected in the August 9, general polls. "We will ensure safety and security here in Marsabit. That is important," he said. The ODM leader also promised to provide water to the residents and their cattle in a bid to end their water-scarcity headache. The team comprised the Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, the Coalition Secretary General Junet Mohamed, former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, COTU bost Francis Atwoli and a host of allied leaders.
