West Pokot school heads have been urged to allow parents to pay school fees using other means to allow children to get quality education. Governor John Lonyangapuo said that school heads should allow parents to pay fees in form of animals and foodstuffs among others. Lonyangapuo said that one of his manifestos is to ensure all children are in school. “l urge school heads to allow barter trade as a means of paying school fees. Most of them have animals at home but can't find markets. Let’s do barter trade,” he said. The governor spoke during the official launch of the county bursary. Lonyangapuo called on the government to beef up security along the border to allow learners to have a peaceful learning environment. He said parents, learners and teachers from areas along the border have been affected. Lonyangapuo called on the government to disarm bandits distorting peace in the region. “Disarmament should be done in areas where cattle rustling is rampant to help restore peace,” he said. Lonyangapuo said the county government has released Sh138 million to the bursary kitty. “Fifty one secondary schools from hardship areas with less than 100 students have received Sh20,000 for each student during the first tranch and day school students received  Sh 7,000 each,” he said. The bursary programme has led to an increase in school enrolment. In 2017 there were only 23,000 students in secondary schools but the number has increased to 70,000. Some of the teachers said the frequent attacks have affected performance in the bordering school citing the KCPE and KCSE results which have drastically dropped. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
