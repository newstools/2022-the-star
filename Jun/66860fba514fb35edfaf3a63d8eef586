Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa on Wednesday dismissed claims that they were poised to end the reverse call service. Ndegwa assured Safaricom customers that the service is still in place and they are not intending to stop it. "I have received many queries on whether we are ‘killing’ our reverse call service. This is untrue. We continue to provide this service as it addresses a key need to a large part of our customer base," he tweeted. Safaricom introduced the service in 2019 to enable its network users, and callers to transfer call charges to their recipients. To use the service, the caller adds # before the phone number of the recipient. Upon picking up the call, they receive a voice prompt asking them to key in '1' to accept the reverse call, or '2' to turn it down. While launching the program then, Safaricom said they are committed to always providing their customers with relevant products in line with their needs. "This innovation is in line with this commitment and has been tailored to mirror the relationships between our customers with a goal of empowering them to always remain connected with their loved ones."
