The Kitui county Health and Sanitation executive Dr Winnie Kitetu has lamented that residents are not donating enough blood to save lives. She urged residents to upscale voluntary donations to replenish the diminishing county blood reserves. “Kitui requires at least 12,000 units of blood annually to sufficiently cater for the needs of residents. The situation in the county is worrying as few donors are coming out,” she said. She revealed that only 2,300 units were donated in 2021 from volunteers in Kitui, representing less than 25 per cent of the blood needed and since January, only 1,400 units have been collected. The health boss spoke during the commemoration of the World Blood Donor Day on Tuesday. The event was marked under the theme: Donating blood is an act of solidarity, join the effort and save lives. Kitetu said the event was aimed at raising awareness on the need for safe blood products. She said it was an opportunity to draw attention to the role voluntary blood donation plays in saving lives. Kitetu said Kitui Blood Transfusion Satellite officials will camp at Kitui Huduma Centre to offer residents an opportunity to donate blood during the seven days exercise. The exercise is a collaboration between the Kenya Red-Cross Kitui, Huduma Centre and Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service. Kitetu also unveiled a vehicle donated to Kitui Blood Transfusion Satellite by KNBTS to enhance the mobility of personnel. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
