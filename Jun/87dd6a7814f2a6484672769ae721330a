Police on Friday said Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja was turned away after presenting himself at the DCI Headquarters to hand in a protest letter, a matter that was disputed by his lawyers. According to a statement by the DCI, Sakaja went to hand-deliver a protest letter to DCI boss George Kinoti. Sakaja had written to Kinoti seeking clarification on media reports that he is facing an imminent arrest over alleged links to an ‘international organized criminal syndicate’. After the delivery, he addressed the media and left for his Riverside office. Sakaja is facing an academic papers forgery case with the IEBC Dispute Committee.
