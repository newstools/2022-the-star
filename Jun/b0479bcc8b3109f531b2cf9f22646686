Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria on Wednesday weighed in on a standoff that marred the Kenya Kwanza Alliance rally under the umbrella "Mt Kenya Express" in Kiambu County. The leader said the altercation between former Governor Kabogo wa Kabogo and Senator Kimani Wamatangi was regrettable. "I will not apportion blame to any of the two gentlemen but I can relate to Kabogo's pain. For three days the UDA leadership has been meeting UDA MP and MCA candidates to plot how to embarrass Kabogo and me during the tour.," he said. Kuria added that the MCAs and MPs who associate with them were warned of dire consequences. "This chicanery is not healthy for our fledgling alliance. It is imperative that we live with not only the letter but also the spirit of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance," he added. Kuria said unless the Alliance allied leaders lived their theme, theirs will be politics of conmanship and deceit. The Chama Cha Kazi leader said they will be raising the concerns with the Alliance principals as provided for in the Alliance instruments. The aforementioned altercations were prompted by Wamatangi when he allegedly denied Kabogo the microphone to address the rally. While speaking, the Senator pointed at the Tujibebe candidate saying he will not accept intimidation. "I'm rallying you to vote me as governor on UDA and I will deliver on the promises that I make. I can also lead the Kiambu people and I won't be intimidated at all," Wamatangi said. Kabongo then pulled out his microphone and fired back at Wamatangi claiming he had sensed early defeat. " If you are a real gentleman cross to this side," Kabogo said. The war of words between the two leaders intensified prompting supporters of the two leaders to join in lashing out at each other. The campaigns were led by Kenya Kwanza's presidential running mate, Rigathi Gachagua.
