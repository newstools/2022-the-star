DP William Ruto's running mate Rigathi Gachagua assured Tharaka Nithi residents that senator Kithure Kindiki will be given a top position if UDA forms the next government after the August polls. Speaking at a rally in Tharaka Nithi on Thursday, Rigathi said the senator will be rewarded for the sacrifice he had made for the party. The Mathira Member of Parliament noted that Kindiki was being prepared for the top position following his appointment as Ruto's Chief Agent. "We have appointed him as Ruto's Chief Agent and the top position that will go to Tharaka Nithi will be given to Kindiki," he said. In May, Kindiki had said that he was not willing to work in Ruto's government because he was taking a break from politics. He said he will not be available for any appointive position after the August 9 polls as he will be relaxing as he reflects on his future and prepares for a comeback in Kenyan politics. "I have decided to take a break from elective politics. I will take the break to reorganise myself as I support my party to deliver the presidency," he said. "I will not be seeking any appointive position whatsoever. However, I will be available to seek any position in future that may be available at the national level." His sentiments came after DP Ruto announced Rigathi as his running mate.
