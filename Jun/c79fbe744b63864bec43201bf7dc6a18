Fishermen at Lake Naivasha have recovered over 50 tonnes of abandoned nets in a major clean-up exercise around the water body. It emerged that the abandoned nets were the main threat in the fisheries sector killing tonnes of fish every month. According to Naivasha subcounty fisheries officer Nicholas Kagundu, most of the nets were either swept by water hyacinth or abandoned by illegal fishermen. He admitted that the nets pose a major threat to the lake's ecosystem, saying they were responsible for mass fish death. “We have suspended all fishing activities to conduct this clean-up where we recovered over 50 tonnes of abandoned nets,” he said on Thursday. Kagundu defended the recent move to increase the number of fishing licenses by 80, saying it will help address illegal fishing. “Those who benefited from the new licenses were former illegal fishermen, the disabled and youth groups,” he said. Deputy commissioner Mutua Kisilu said the lake has faced other challenges like illegal fishing. He said the state was keen to change the narrative around the water body by making it more resourceful. “We expect the fish catch to rise once we free it from the tonnes of dead nets that have been choking it for months,” he said. Hellsgate MCA Virginia Wamaitha termed the lake critical to the economy of the region as it employs tens of youths and traders. “This is our farm and we are ready to protect it by removing the abandoned nets to increase our yield,” she said. Jeremiah Mutiso, the chairman of Karagita landing beach said they lost nets worth thousands of shillings through the water hyacinth. “Once this exercise is through we expect fish catch to increase and we are keen to make it an annual event,” he said.
