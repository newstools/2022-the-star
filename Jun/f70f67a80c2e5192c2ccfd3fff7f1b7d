A multi-Agency security team has recovered eight cattle which had been reported lost by residents of Jaldesa in Marsabit. The National Police Service (NPS) said that the cattle recovered on Monday was due to the collaboration between the multi-agency team and residents of Shurr led by their elders. "The security team is engaging all communities to sensitize on the importance of branding their livestock for ease of identification whenever they are stolen and stray away from the grazing fields,” NPS said. This comes in the wake of an ongoing operation to mop-up illegal guns in Marsabit county due to rising insecurity cases. Officials said the operation will continue until at least 5,000 illegal firearms are retrieved. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said although the multi-agency team deployed last month had restored peace in the vast county, the mopping of illegal weapons must be concluded as a long-term security strategy. He said more than 200 guns, 3,000 ammunitions, a grenade and assorted bayonets have been recovered under Operation Rejesha Amani Marsabit. "We need to recover more guns. We will review this operation when we have around 3,000 guns. We believe there are still many more guns in the wrong hands," Matiang’i said. The CS further said the curfew, which was extended by 30 days early this month, will be in place until after the August 9 General Election. The local administration officers are also mobilizing residents to support the ongoing process in the County by organizing a peace march from Marsabit town to Hawaye in North Horr.
