ODM leader Raila Odinga on Wednesday, March 2, resumed his Azimio campaigns with his first stop being Nakuru County. The former Prime Minister sold his Azimio la Umoja gospel to residents of the county, as he seeks their support for the country's top job. This was Raila's second tour of the county in less than two months. Raila was flanked by the Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui throughout various stopovers. Raila made stop overs in Molo, Turi, Elburgon, Njoro (Posta) and Nakuru City. "My agenda is to see a united, peaceful and prosperous country." "I want to see a country where we all can live and work freely anywhere in the four corners of our country," Raila tweeted. Nakuru is seen as one of the counties Raila has put much focus on ahead of the August 9 polls. The county has always leaned towards the ODM leader's rivals in previous elections.
