Former PS at the ministry of transport Irungu Nyakera has asked governor seats and presidential aspirants to pick women as their running mates. This came up during the International Women's Day celebrations on Tuesday when Nyakera met with aspirants who are vying under the Farmer's Party. He urged Kenya Kwanza and Azimio La Umoja coalitions to have women as their running mates. During the meeting, Nyakera unveiled ex-MCA Catherine Wairimu Mugo as his deputy governor. Mugo was vying for the Murang’a Woman Representative position under United Democratic Party (UDA) but defected to the Farmers Party to deputise Nyakera. The former PS affirmed the Farmers Party's commitment to the International Women’s Day 2022 theme; Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow”. “The appointment of Catherine Wairimu Mugo as my running mate confirms the commitment to breaking the gender bias and offering an equal platform for sustainable development," Nyakera said. The former PS said the Farmers party will not be field a presidential candidate for the August polls. He added that they will not be joining pre-election coalitions but instead, they will approach the August 9, polls as an independent party.
