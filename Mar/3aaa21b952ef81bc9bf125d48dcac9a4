Mt Kenya residents have been asked to vote for Jubilee candidates as a show of approval for President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership. MPs Kwenya Thuku (Kinangop), Wanjiku Kibe (Gatundu North), Gabriel Kago (Githunguri), Jude Njomo (Kiambu) and Jonah Mburu (Lari) said they need to represent Uhuru's interest for Mt Kenya in the next Parliament. The leaders spoke on Thursday at Wangunja stadium in Lari, Kiambu, when they conducted Jubilee Party campaigns. They said residents should vote in all MPs who will be nominated to run on Jubilee tickets. Mburu also dismissed claims by Deputy President William Ruto's UDA camp that Jubilee was dead. He said Uhuru who is also the party leader has been busy serving the country adding that he (Uhuru)  has developed even the regions that never supported him. "He has asked us not to play too much politics, but to concentrate on our work. Those claiming that the party is no more, are lying to you. We are here and strong" the MP said. However, residents are confused with JP politics, since the last presidential candidate now supports his 2017 competitor Raila Odinga. Raila is being fronted by Azimio La Umoja alliance which has so many parties supporting his bid. The JP MPs said Mt Kenya residents should vote them in so that they can maintain their unity. Njomo said that was the only way to keep Uhuru relevant in day to day politics, after he retires since he is the party leader. "Uhuru has a lot of interest with Mt Kenya residents. He wants to see us grow. He does not want us to be pushed to the walls. We can only do it by giving him the muscle through electing a lot of his party's MPs" he said. The MPs said once they attain a bigger number of legislators in Parliament, no one will control them and they will be able to push for development in unison. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
