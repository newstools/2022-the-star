Election jitters have hit peak levels in Embakasi West with a section of parliamentary hopefuls seeking to unseat incumbent MP George Theuri trading barbs. They have rubbished claims that the parliamentary race is a three-horse contest between Theuri, who is seeking to defend his seat on a United Democratic Alliance Party ticket (UDA) and the Jubilee and ODM aspirants. Dr Boash Ogello, one of the aspirants, says voters should be given a chance to decide who they want. He said those who have connected well with the electorate  will  carry the day. Ogello is eying the ODM ticket at the nominations in his quest to oust Theuri on the August 9, polls. "I am the man who built the constituency Party offices. I am the one who deserves the ODM ticket,” he said. ODM's Kennedy Odhiambo and Jubilee's Mark Muriithii Mwenje are also eying the seat. Speaking at  Unity Primary School where he donated exam materials to pupils, Ogello said that the three contestants have ganged up to portray themselves as front runners in the parliamentary race. He however said one's track record and party loyalty will play a big role come nomination and election time. "I have been Raila’s and ODM Chief Campaigner all through and stood with him through thick and thin, " Ogello said.
