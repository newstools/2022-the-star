Nzoia Sugar head coach Salim Babu says his immediate task is to salvage the Kenyan Premier League club from the jaws of relegation. The millers are currently third from the bottom of the log with 15 points but Babu holds on to the conviction they still possess sufficient ammunition that can fire them past their opponents in their remaining fixtures. The coach's arrival from the second-tier side, Kisumu All-stars mid last month injected some freshness into the club. He went on to guide the team to a hard-fought 1-0 win over the much-fancied Kariobangi Sharks at Thika Stadium barely a week after taking the reins. Babu admits that the mere thought of relegation is giving the team sleepless nights. “I have sat the players down and we have agreed all our focus should be concentrated on retaining our top-flight status. Everything else will come much later after we secure a safe spot in the league,” Babu said. Perhaps a win over a struggling Mathare United might just pump the crucial zest that is needed to set the Bungoma-based millers on course for recovery. Babu has warned his charges against underrating their opponents who are experiencing a torrid season. “We cannot afford to drop any points at this stage. Collecting maximum points in our next fixture against Mathare will boost our chances of survival,” said Babu. As much as he admits there are some key areas of concern in the current squad, Babu continues to place unwavering faith in his current squad. “It's quite unfortunate I came days after the mid-season transfer window had concluded so I missed out on the opportunity to get sign players. “I'm a coach and there is no way I'm going to tell the existing crop of players that they are not up to the scratch. The fact that they are already playing in the premier league means they are good enough,” said Babu.
