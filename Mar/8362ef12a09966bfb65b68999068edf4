Kenya Power and Lighting Company have announced the resumption of prepaid and postpaid token bill payment. They have notified that customers can now buy prepaid tokens via 888880 and postpaid bills via 888888. “Undelivered tokens will be sent to respective customers within one hour,” KPLC said in a statement. KPLC has apologized for the inconvenience caused. Earlier on KPLC had issued a notice for token services delay citing technical hitch. “We would like to inform our customers that we are experiencing a technical hitch which is affecting the prepaid token generation and postpaid bill payment,” KPLC earlier said. The hitch led to many customers being unable to access token services in the better part of Thursday morning. The resumption of normalcy now means Kenyans can be served promptly while purchasing tokens.
