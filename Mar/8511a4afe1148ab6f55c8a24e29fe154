The Migori High Court has sentenced two Tanzanian farmhands to 35 years in jail each over the murder of their boss. Justice Roselin Wendo sentenced the two Marwa Magige Kieusi and Makonge Wangwi Maseti on February 24. The accused will have two weeks to appeal the decision. The state, through the deceased Thomas Moronge Makuri charged the two over the murder incident. The incident happened between the nights of June 5 and 6 of 2020, at Karosi village in Bukira East location, Kuria West subcounty. The court heard that the two used a panga to murder their boss and disposed off the body inside an underground water tank. The employees are said to have had had a disagreement with their boss. After the incident, the two fled across the border. Kieusi was arrested on June 18, 2020, while Maseti was arrested on August 11, 2020, by Tanzanian security officials who handed them over to Kenya. On June 30, 2020, Kieusi was formally charged over the crime where he pleaded not guilty while his co-accused Maseti was also charged for the same crime on August 26, 2020. Because they pleaded differently, the matter was consolidated on October 14, 2020, with the prosecutor closing their case on May 20, 2021. The two were found guilty of the offence on November 15, 2021. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
