As the world marks International Women's day, Ruth Matete opened up about various struggles they have gone through. She celebrated herself for going through so much and still coming out strong. She chose herself, recounting how she dealt with multiple pains at the same time. In 2020, Ruth lost her husband through a fire accident. She was barely two months pregnant. She shared how tough it was even for her after rumours she had killed her husband. "Pregnancy emotions. Burying my husband three months after his death because of issues surrounding his death. Corona. My business closing..." she wrote. She added that took a toll on her. In that period, Matete even deactivated her social media just to remain sane. In her post she explained that the reason she chose to celebrate herself is since she did not give up. "I celebrate you, who went through probably something worse than I did and still made it. Women! We are strong! We are powerful! We can! Meanwhile, pregnancy can really humble you."
