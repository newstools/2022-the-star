Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo has said that if Deputy President William Ruto does not pick Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua to be his running mate, then the Kenya Kwanza alliance will be as good as dead. Speaking on Tuesday, Maanzo said he believes that if the Mathira MP is not Ruto's number two, Gachagua and his allies will pull out of the Kenya Kwanza alliance. The legislator said that the Mt Kenya region is a vote-rich region and they have expectations that presidential candidates will pick a running mate from the region. "Azimio la Umoja, One Kenya Alliance and UDA or Kenya Kwanza, the running mate will still come from Central Kenya and if William Ruto's running mate is not Rigathi (Gahagua) then that is the end of that coalition," Maanzo said on KTN News. "The deputy presidency of UDA I believe belongs to Rigathi and I expect him to be named Ruto's deputy bearing in mind the effort  he has made to build UDA and financial support to Ruto." The Makueni MP was reacting to remarks by Gachagua on Monday, saying that DP Ruto's running mate will not be ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, but will come from the Mt Kenya region. Gachagua said the ANC party leader was privy to the fact before joining the Ruto camp. "When they came for discussion we were very fort-right because we are honest people. They were told that we agreed that running mate is from the mountain (Mt Kenya region)," he said. "We don't want to con someone. They will not be running mates." Gachagua said the UDA party will unveil Ruto as their presidential candidate on March 15. MP Maanzo noted that Gachagua's statement is true because it is the same problem that will face Azimio. The Mathira MP's remarks have erupted a bitter war of words in the DP’s camp over the running mate post amid questions over Mudavadi’s position in the Kenya Kwanza team.
