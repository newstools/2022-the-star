Kenya National Examinations Council chairman John Onsati has warned Kenyans against examination cheating during the ongoing national KCPE examinations. Onsati said examination cheating won’t be condoned stating that those found culpable of the malpractice will be dealt with accordingly in line with the law. “The appeal is that examination cheating will not be condoned because it is only destroying our children and our country,” Onsati said. The KNEC chairman addressed the press in Machakos town where he supervised the opening of the exams container and distribution of the KCPE papers on Tuesday. Onsati officiated the KNEC’s container opening at 6.00 am. “We are telling those who will try that: one – they will be caught, and two – it doesn’t add value,” Onsati said. “We are on schedule and pray to God that we finish this day well and going tomorrow when KCPE will be completed,” he added. Onsati said as from Monday when the examinations began, they were going on well across the country without any incidences worth reporting. He said cases that were reported nationally on day one were being handled effectively hence no cause for alarm.
