Up to 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in a Russian artillery strike on the north-eastern city of Okhtyrka on Sunday, according to a local official. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, the head of the Sumy region's state administration, says the strike destroyed a Ukrainian military unit, and rescuers and volunteers have been working to retrieve the bodies from the rubble. "Many people have died. Currently, places are being prepared in the cemetery for about 70 dead Ukrainian soldiers," Zhyvytskyi posted on Telegram. "But the enemy also gets what he deserves," he added, saying there were "a lot of Russian bodies" in the city, which are now being given to the Red Cross. His claims have not been independently verified.
