Gukena FM's MC Jimmie Kajim is urging young people to concentrate on building themselves rather than being used by politicians during campaigns. Speaking to Word Is, MC Kajim said he has been meeting the youths and most of them are speaking the language of change. "I am happy that I get to interact with young people over the weekend as I host Mugiithi shows, and I can tell you they are crying for change," he said. "Politicians are also seeking for their jobs. They might easily forget you after they get elected." Kajim, who was recently appointed as brand ambassador for AMG Realtors and Golden Spur, also asked the youths to be aggressive in all they do. "Keep doing what you know best because you never know who is watching you. If you can change your listeners or fans to become your clients, then you are on the right track. It is not how big your numbers are but being able to convert them into clients." As a content creator, Kajim said consistency is the reason he has been able to manoeuver in various areas. "I have been in the entertainment industry for close to 10 years and it is is now that most of these companies are engaging my talent," he said. "You may have a godfather but it depends on how much effort you put in your craft. Keep knocking on all doors even when the answer is no. Don't stop. Let people know what you do but don't wait for them to call you."
