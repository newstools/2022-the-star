Trail Blazers' right attacker Moses Sialo will use his international experience to help the newbies fight for a playoff slot in the ongoing Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league this season. Sialo was named the best attacker during the 2017 playoffs when he turned up for the Cooperative Bank team. His exploits on the courts saw him join Equity Bank in 2018 before moving to Rwanda Energy Group in October the same year. The 27-year-old won the league with the Rwandese side in 2019 to cap off a perfect year for the hard-hitting  Sialo who previously also enjoyed a three-month trial spell in Japan. The Kenyatta University alumnus joined Blazers last year as the Geoffrey Omondi-coached side was formed in November. "I feel settled at Blazers and my obligation is to help the team qualify for the playoffs. From there, we can fight for a top-two slot which I believe is attainable," Sialo said. He added: "I have the experience to guide my teammates. There's unity in diversity and as a new team, we are getting to know each other and you can see the commitment and hard yards in training." With injuries behind the towering attacker, Sialo added that the team has plenty of time to fine-tune their weaknesses ahead of the fourth leg next month. Blazers' 3-2 win over Equity was a morale booster while the 3-0 loss to ruthless Kenya Prisons was a learning curve for the 'new kids on the block'. "We have been sluggish in the past. We are working on quick movement with and without the ball. I can now play without strapping my legs. I feel relieved that the niggling back, shoulder, and knee injuries  have lessened  and in a few months, I'll be back to my best." Sialo was once called to the national team in 2018 but there was no assignment. His focus at the moment is on the club.
