Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he has no qualms with President Uhuru Kenyatta's endorsement of the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. In a statement at his command centre on Tuesday, Kalonzo said the President has a right to back whoever he wishes for the top seat. The reaction came hot on the heels of President Uhuru's apparent endorsement of Raila for the presidency. In several meetings, including the Sagana III, Uhuru publicly campaigned for Raila for the presidency. Kalonzo, however, termed Uhuru's backing as personal saying it is the Jubilee party endorsement that matters. "I have no problem Uhuru suporting Raila, it's his constitutional right. If it was the Jubilee Party that was endorsing Raila, it would have been an issue. I think it is the delegates that should endorse. But for Uhuru, I have no problem," Kalonzo said. The remarks came after Kalonzo had laid bare details of his 2017 agreement with ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kalonzo revealed that Raila was to back him for the presidency in 2022 polls after he accepted to be his running mate in 2017. He, however, expressed commitment to work with Raila if only the 2017 pact becomes part of the negotiations. Kalonzo's 'bombshell'   came barely a week after he attended a Jubilee party NDC at KICC where commitment to working together was expressed. Raila was present at the NDC. Uhuru who chaired the NDC said he will rally the leaders into forming one team that will produce a solo presidential candidate who will face Deputy President William Ruto.
