Reels, an idea that was borrowed from TikTok, is continuing to drive strong engagement on Instagram. The Meta company has decided that it will further lean into short video consumption on both Instagram and Facebook. Instagram announced that the move will help creators make the most of their content opportunities at the same time providing entertainment. “The shorter, entertaining videos will allow people to inspire trends, express themselves to their audience in a flexible (and fun) way and push culture forwards,” Instagram said in a statement. Reels has been the largest contributor to engagement growth on Instagram. Last year, Instagram merged the Feed video and IGTV into one format- Instagram video. Instagram also talked about a new link feature that will enable users to share their content with followers. “Videos watched on Instagram will have features such as a full-screen viewer and the option to tap to mute. We are also working to create one, consistent way to share your videos, bringing together creation tools and offering new ways to discover content.” They said. In terms of monetization, Instagram said it is removing its in-stream ads option entirely, which will reduce monetization opportunities for creators. “Because of our focus on Reels, in-stream video ads (previously known as IGTV ads) will no longer be supported. Creators that are actively monetising with in-stream video ads will receive a temporary monthly payment based on recent earnings.” Here are the other upcoming changes
