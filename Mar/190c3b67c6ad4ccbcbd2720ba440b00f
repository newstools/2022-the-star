Clinical officers on internship programs in Nairobi on Monday demonstrated at the Ministry of Health head offices saying they have gone seven months without pay. The national chairman of the interns, Enock Bosire told the Star that 4,000 interns countrywide have not received their Sh15,000 monthly stipends for seven months since July 2021. He said that their one-year internship contract could be terminated before they receive their pay. "We are really suffering out there as life is tough and most of us are having difficulties in taking care of our bills. We demand Sh105,000 each for the services we have been providing in the hospitals," he said. The CO kfrom Makueni, Narok, Kisumu, Isiolo, Garissa, Machakos, Nairobi, Kajiado, Kisii, Homa Bay, Migori and Kitui matched from the GPO to the Ministry of Health Headquarters. Cynthia Makena, an intern at Mbagathi Hospital, said that she is depressed since her bills are accumulating by the day. "The COs above us take advantage of us in the hospitals. We are the ones doing most of the work as they sit and relax. Transport to and from work is really expensive and some of us cannot even afford meals. We just want the government to pay us," she said. The Clinical Officers represented two cohorts one which signed a contract from July 2021-July 2022 and another from December 2021-December 2022. The latter had not received their payroll numbers. They said that interns strike every year for them to get paid. They carried placards that read #No pay, No work #Punda amechoka #we are suffering. Last week, those in Western Kenya also demonstrated in Mbale asking for their pay. Vihiga referral Medical superintend Vitalis Juma said the interns have been out of duty since Monday demanding their pay. The Ministry of Health has not responded to queries about the delay.
