Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Tuesday publicly accused ODM leader Raila Odinga of betrayal and flashed out a 2017 secret agreement that bars the ODM leader from running for president. Musyoka, one of the One Kenya Alliance principals, was Raila’s running mate in the 2017 Nasa coalition that also had ANC's Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula. The machine that nearly vanquished President Uhuru’s re-election bid, triggering a Supreme Court presidential petition battle, collapsed in 2020 over trust deficits.
