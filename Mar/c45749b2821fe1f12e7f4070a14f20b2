The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has urged Kenyans to avoid taking the law into their hands. The ODPP Noordin Haji condemned the harassment of a female motorist along the Wangari Maathai road on Friday. Further, Haji  stated that investigations by the police are ongoing and those found culpable will be charged. “It is regrettable that we have to deal with gender-based violence on the same week we are marking the International Women’s Day. Women and girls need to be protected and not subjected to such inhumane and degrading treatment. Other Kenyans have also condemned the incidence terming it as heinous and barbaric. Chief Justice Martha Koome has also expressed her disapproval of the same. In a statement on Tuesday, the CJ said the actions by the boda boda riders were uncalled for, adding that the perpetrators should face the law. “I hope that the perpetrators will be apprehended and processed through the criminal justice system in a systematic manner and in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law,” said Koome. Further, she said Kenyan women, girls and all citizens must be protected and urged agencies to put measures in place to curb cases of sexual and gender-based violence. The incident happened on the Wangari Maathai road on Friday but the matter came to the limelight on Monday after the video was widely circulated on social media. Police have said that so far, 32 suspects have been arrested in connection with the assault. According to Police Spokesperson Bruno Shioso, the Nairobi area command is coordinating the hunt for more suspects. He said those arrested will be arraigned on Tuesday. "I had mentioned that 16 riders were arrested but by now, the number has increased to at least 32, with around 12 motorcycles impounded," Shioso said on Citizen TV.
