Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has asked for help and prayers before he joins any coalition. He claimed that he had been branded an ‘indecisive kingmaker’ forcing him to release an agreement they signed with ODM's leader Raila Odinga ahead of the 2017 polls. He, however, claimed Raila was in breach of it. Speaking on Tuesday at the Kalonzo Musyoka Command Centre, Kalonzo said it’s only the church who can help him out. “I am very prayerful but I think I need help. I hope today I have acquitted myself,” he said. "… I promise the country that they will see a different Kalonzo. We are clear on our buffalo soldier approach. We have been clear on the commitment to end corruption." Kalonzo, who read the coalition pact that they signed with ODM party leader Raila Odinga, said he was ready to enter into another pact but noted that leaders must fulfil their promises. "I will ask Dennis Kavisu (his aide) to give you copies of this agreement... I will give this to the church as well because it is the conscience of the nation," he said. "I ask Kenyans to engage in honest conversation on this document. I do this not because I want anything personal or that I am seeking sympathy but an honest engagement … I ask the church to take the  role and lead us." The former vice president said he is willing to reunite with Raila but on condition that he agrees to commit to the document they secretly signed in the lead up to the 2017 polls. At the same time, Kalonzo said President Uhuru Kenyatta should lead the talks between him and Raila.
