Popular entertainment joint Kiza Club has rebranded to Kulture Lounge. Speaking to artistes, the club's MD Amb Ali Oumarou said he is working to create a showbiz buzz that will direct superstar traffic to the country. "Since entertainment is a global village, we are looking at bringing back the exciting mood the region experienced in showbiz, just like we did before the pandemic struck," Oumarou said. "Instead of local artistes fighting visiting artists, why don't we instead work on a mutually beneficial exchange programme? A win-win." Regions of interest include Africa, the United Kingdom, USA, Jamaica and Canada. Invitees include boy bands Sauti Sol and H_Art the band and Akothee. Others are Busy Signal, Patoranking, Wizkid. Tiwa Savage had already joined the initiative and projects were already underway.
