Explaining his choice, the Meru County resident said: “What inspired me to pick this cause is the fact that the college supports students by getting them jobs after their studies." “With my support, through betPawa, I hope it continues to grow and creates a bright future for the young generation. The chance to give back to the community is a great deal and I don't take it lightly. I love helping in any way that I can,” David says.
