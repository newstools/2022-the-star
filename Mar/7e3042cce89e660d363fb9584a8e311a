Marjan Hussein Marjan has been confirmed as the CEO of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said he was found as the most suitable during the just concluded recruitment process. He was among five candidates who were shortlisted. Marjan has held the post in an acting capacity since April 2019. His rise started after he was appointed by Chebukati as the October 2017 repeat presidential poll coordinator. He will take over from Ezra Chiloba, who was fired over alleged gross misconduct. Chebukati's commission had shortlisted Marjan, the 2017 deputy CEO Nancy Wanjiku, Mabonga Joel, Zephaniah Okeyo and George Michugu from a list of over 500 applicants. The commission received 860 applicants for the position. Interviews for the deputy CEO position will start on March 10. The commission is keen on putting its house in order to correct indicting mistakes cited by the Supreme Court in the 2017 presidential petition. Before the interviews, Election Observation Group National Coordinator Mule Musau had said IEBC must go for a CEO who has strong grasp of the management of the electoral process. Mule said although the time left to the polls is constrained, the commission must hire someone who is well experienced in election matters. “We need one who would quickly establish a good working relationship with the commissioners and acquaint themselves with the entire secretariat including field officers,” Mule said.
