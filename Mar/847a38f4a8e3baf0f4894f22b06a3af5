ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Wednesday resume his Azimio Mtaani campaigns, with his first stop being Nakuru County. This will be Raila's second tour of the county in less than two months. The former Prime Minister is expected to sell his Azimio la Umoja gospel to residents of the county, as he seeks their support for the country's top job. Nakuru is seen as one of the counties Raila has put much focus on ahead of the August 9 polls. The county has always leaned towards the ODM leader's competitors in previous elections. Raila's campaigns in the county are led by Governor Lee Kinyanjui, who is in the Azimio la Umoja Movement. Raila will make stop overs in Molo, Turi, Elburgon, Njoro (Posta) and Nakuru City. Deputy President William Ruto, on the other hand, continues with his 12-day tour abroad. He left the country on Sunday and is expected to tour the US, UK and Qatar.
