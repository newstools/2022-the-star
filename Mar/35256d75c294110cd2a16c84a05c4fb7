Nearly three months after saying 'I do' to singer Guardian Angel, Esther Musila still faces criticism over her relationship. The mother of three says she has learnt to ignore the mean comments and trolling on social media, but sometimes she is pushed to respond. "I learnt to ignore, but there are just people who still don't get it and they want to push your buttons," Esther said in a Q&A with fans. She responded, "I believe in everyone being the author of their own story in life." Esther was also asked about the worst challenge in her relationship life. "That I have no more privacy. I can't go anywhere unnoticed. I miss that freedom." She said she is working out after gaining to 78kg now.
