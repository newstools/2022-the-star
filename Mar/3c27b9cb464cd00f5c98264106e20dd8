Kenyan junior amateur Njoroge Kibugu will bank on improved tee-shots in his pursuit for a maiden cut at the Kenya Open Golf Championship today. Kabugu wrapped up his day’s campaign with an impressive round of 1 under Par 70 to lead the Kenyan assault as Greg Snow closed the day with a 71. All Kibugu needs to do today is to shoot a par or an under to secure a cut at the iconic event which counts towards the DP World Tour. Mutahi is playing in the Kenya Open for the first time and is one of the Kenyans tipped for the cut after his compatriots struggled through round one. “It's my first shot at the Kenya Open and I'm overly excited with my performance thus far.  I feel good and ready to go for it in round two. The setup on the course was totally different from what we are used to. The greens were firmer and faster today, making it really hard for us to score well,” said Kibugu after his day’s round. Asked what lessons he will carry into the second round, Kabugu went on: “I will try to be more aggressive off the tee as I need quite a big ride over there. My short game is somewhat impressive so let’s see how it goes,” he said. Kabugu enjoyed the services of former Kenya amateur team captain Bo Ciera who is his caddie for the event.  It was a bad day in the office for the Kenyans who could only manage disappointing over-par scores. Kenyan amateur champion Adel Balala managed 1 over par 72. He will need to shoot an under-par today to stay on course for the cut. Another junior player Taimur Malik and Railways’ Samuel Nhoroge wrapped up round one with a +3. Top Kenyans Daniel Nduva, Simon Ngige, and Simon Ngige will need a miracle in today’s Round Two to make the cut. Nduva shot a disappointing +7, Ngige +8, and Wakhu +8. A strong field of 156 players is gracing this year’s Open which is part of the DP World Tour series, formerly European Tour.  The pros are battling it out for a share of the Sh220 million (1,750,000 Euros) prize fund.
