National women's beach volleyball coach Salome Wanjala wants Kenya Volleyball Federation to give them the nod to start training next week in readiness for the Commonwealth Games qualifiers. The team was expected to proceed to residential camp training after the third leg of the Deep Heat beach volleyball tour in Mombasa last weekend but this is yet to happen, according to Wanjala. The African qualifiers for the quadrennial event are due March 24-29 in Accra, Ghana and the team has only three weeks left to prepare. The Commonwealth Games will take place from July 30 to August 7 with Kenya keen to represent Africa. Wanjala, who replaced Sammy Mulinge as head coach a fortnight ago, doubles up as the Nairobi Prisons women's volleyball coach. "We are waiting for communication. Hopefully, by the end of the week, we should know the way forward in regard to the program,"  said the former KCB player said. Wanjala said the sooner the team hits camp the better. " This will enable us not only to focus but also polish on the basics. We must be spot-on in this game." Six players were named to the national women's team. They include Brackcides Agala, Gaudencia Makokha, Phosca Kasisi, Yvonne Wavinya, Naomi Too, and Veronica Adhiambo. The men's team composes of Ibrahim Oduor, James Mwaniki, Donald Mchete, Wilfred Kimutai, Elphas Makuto, and Jairus Kipkosgei The pair of Agala and Makokha, who formed the team to the Tokyo Olympics last year,  won the Mombasa leg last weekend. Wanjala is keen to pick up from where her predecessor, Mulinge left. Mulinge made history by guiding Kenya to the first ever Olympic Games last year.
