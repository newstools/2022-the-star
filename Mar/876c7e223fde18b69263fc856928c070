ODM leader Raila Odinga has said he was sure of trouncing Deputy President William Ruto in the August Polls, terming him 'lightweight political kid'. Raila said after sizing up his main rival, he had seen him as a small and junior politician and he was sure of flooring him in the August 9 general election. He was speaking when he addressed mourners at Kanga Primary on Thursday during the funeral of Mzee Jared Osiany, the father of Industrialisation CAS Dabvid Osiany. “After holding him in my hands (Ruto), I realized he is a juvenile who I will trounce in the polls,” Raila said. “He (Ruto) has been constantly referring to me as a state project. If he is man enough then let him face off with me on August 9 and he will know that he was once my political student,” Odinga said. He was accompanied by ODM Deputy Party leader and Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya, Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyongo, Migori Senator Ochillo Ayacko, Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and a host of other leaders. Junet said Kenyans should brace for a major alliance that will shape the direction the country will take under Azimio la Umoja. “We are in talks with other parties and will soon be sealing a deal that will give birth to the larger Azimio Coalition. Already, Jubilee and ODM have sealed their deal. All we are waiting for is a formal engagement with other like-minded parties for a formal engagement,” Junet said. “I’m calling on our like-minded friends to seize the chance and get on board before the transfer window is sealed.”
