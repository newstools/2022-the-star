Nigerian singer Yemi Alade has been appointed Global Ambassador for #ItsUpToUs, a pan-African campaign. The campaign encourages Africans to unite and get vaccinated against Covid-19. The announcement was marked by the release of a campaign video featuring the singer. #ItsUpToUs comes at a critical time in Africa’s fight against Covid-19. Yemi said she will be releasing a campaign Unity Anthem next week that will be accompanied by an #ItsUpToUs dance challenge. "I’m delighted to be a part of #ItsUptoUs, a movement that encourages Africans to take up the responsibility in making the world safe again. I’m happy to lend my voice to this important issue and moment." Last year, the campaign ran in seven countries, including Kenya.
