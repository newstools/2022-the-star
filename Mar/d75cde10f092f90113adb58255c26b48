Lemongrass originates from Asia and is used in many Asian cuisines. It is preferred because of its lemony flavour that stands up to prolonged cooking, making it perfect for slow-cooked stews and curries. When preparing lemongrass, it is advised to only use the middle part of the stalk where the flavour is (the green part). Discard about 1 inch from the bottom and two inches from the top (there's no flavour in these parts). Ingredients  Preparation Step 1 Using a Ziploc bag, combine chicken, chopped lemongrass, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and pepper. Step 2 Add cayenne pepper if you want this to be spicy. Seal then shake the Ziploc bag to evenly disperse marinade with the chicken. Step 3 Place in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Step 4 Using a sufuria, heat vegetable oil over medium heat then cook the chicken for 7 minutes per side, or until each side is nicely browned. Step 5 Slice into strips and serve over a bowl of steamed rice sprinkled with sesame seeds. Garnish with chopped cilantro. Enjoy with friends and family with a passion fruit juice or white wine of choice.
