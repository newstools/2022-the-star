Award-winning actor Pascal Tokodi received a lot of criticism for telling President Uhuru Kenyatta to watch the TV show 'Selina'. Speaking to Word Is, Tokodi said he would love to speak to him. "I would love to just pick his brains," he said. "I would love to get bits and pieces from him and share my mind about the entertainment industry." Earlier, Tokodi said meeting the President for a few seconds, he learnt that he supports local talent. "I would also love to tell him the struggles we go through," he said. Pascal, who stars in the film as Nelson, said the show has nurtured his talent and built his brand. "It has taught me about love. Some things like putting rose petals on the floor, I do them at home, too," he said.
