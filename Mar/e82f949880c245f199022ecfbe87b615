Meru Senator Mithika Linturi had a rough time addressing residents of his county on Sunday after rowdy youth chanted him down. Video footage of the incident shows the MP struggling to address Meru residents who are heard chanting pro-Azimio La Umoja slogans. Azimio La Umoja is led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Linturi is a member of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The Senator, who launched his Meru governor seat bid on the same day, is seen in the video unable to address the crowd and is forced to let the group to continue chanting. The incident came a few days after the MP was interrupted while addressing the CITAM church in Meru. This is after he began disparaging the ODM leader Raila Odinga in his address forcing the presiding Bishop to cut him short. Bishop Calisto Odede explained to him before the congregation that as a church, they are not in the business of taking political sides as their house of worship welcomes all across the political divide. "As a church, we try to minister to people from different political parties without creating any sense of animosity. "In a function like this, which in our church, we try to maintain that attitude that everything else comes, whether you are UDA, ODM or Jubilee, you are welcomed here," Odede said. The Senator apologized and was allowed to continue addressing the church.
