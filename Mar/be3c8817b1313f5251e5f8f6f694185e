A police officer, his wife and their four year-old son were on Friday night burnt beyond recognition in a fire incident which gutted the house as they slept in their Kesebek home at Longisa in Bomet east. The incident which threw the village in shock and grief is said have occurred at around 2am with the cause of the inferno which completely razed the timber-structured house yet to be ascertained. Confirming the incident, Longisa chief Paul Langat said efforts by the neighbors who responded to calls to put off the fire were unsuccessful as the fire had already engulfed the whole house. An elder daughter who was in a separate house said she heard her father calling for help prompting her to raise alarm which attracted the residents. While it is unclear if there was any domestic brawl between the husband and wife, Langat said the cop had been away in Nairobi and had just arrived at home the evening before the fire and retired to bed. "We do not want to speculate for now what may have started the fire but we know at the moment is that the officer is based in Bungoma and has been away in Nairobi for a refresher course,” the chief said. He added that officials from the Kenya power company have also visited the home to check if there might have been a problem with power connection. He said that security officers have launched investigations into the incident. The remains of the deceased were moved to Longisa hospital mortuary.
