A former university student has declared his interest in the Kakamega senator seat ahead of the August 9 polls. Dauclas Shamala, a graduate in environmental science and community development, has launched his bid to replace Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala. So far he is the only candidate who has shown interest in the seat. Malala will be vying for the Kakamega Governor seat. Shamala's main agenda is to awaken the agricultural sector in the county, which he says is on its deathbed. He will vie on a Democratic Action Party-K (DAP-K) party ticket. "I want to be the Senator to make the agricultural aspect of our county more vibrant as it has always been," Shamala said. He also promised to revive the sugarcane sector in the county. "For instance Butali Sugar Company, we need more of such companies to provide opportunities for the youth," he said. Shamala also said his passion for humanitarian work pushed his ambitions to serve the people of Kakamega. "Apart from Senators working as oversight, I will also bring new deals that will benefit the people in the county," he added. He cited an example of the late Malava MP Soita Shitanda who was hailed for fronting the Butali Sugar Company deal. Shamala also promised to increase employment opportunities for the youth, if elected. The race to unseat Malala has not yet attracted any other aspirants. Malala will battle out with Deputy Governor Philip Kutima, former Senator Boni Khalwale, former Butere MP Amukowa Anangwe and Lugari MP Ayub Savula. Others are County Assembly Clerk Laban Atemba, former Ketraco CEO Fernandes Barasa, lawyer Michael Osundwa, Leonard Shimaka and Sammy Omukoko.
