There is nothing as satisfying as peeling up a ripe banana, and a perfectly clean white flesh strikes your eyeballs. Well, bananas turn brown for a variety of reasons; if you cut open a banana, oxygen affects the enzymes in the banana which turns the inside brown. If you are making a banana pudding for guests, squeezing pineapple or lime juice can help preserve freshness. This helps slow down the oxidation process. Cutting them up to pieces then freezing them is also another way of preserve the bananas. Freezing slows down the ethylene emissions and it actually better than just simple refrigeration. Remember to always wait for the bananas to ripe before you put them in the fridge. Putting the bananas in the fridge before they are ripe will inhibit the ripening process and it can turn your banana peels brown faster. If your ripe bananas turn brown while still in the fridge, don't panic, they are still fresh. Peel them up and they should still be slightly firm. Bananas should be stored separately from other fruits and vegetables. This is because as fruits and vegetables ripen, they tend to produce a gas that speeds up the ripening process. I am sure you have seen your aunt or grandmother store up some unripe bananas with apples or avocados. You should actually hang bananas from a hook, it prevents them from bruising. A bruised banana has darker or brown spots and the bruises and punctures leave the banana exposed to air, which speeds up the ripening process Hanging also helps the ethylene gas to work slowly, hence preserving the freshness. Important tip:* Wrapping the crown of the banana with foil paper slows down the ripening process. Ensure you cut the stalk of a banana from the bunch to avoid exposing it to oxygen which can speed up the ripening process.
