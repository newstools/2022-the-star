At least four people have died and 30 injured when a four-storey building collapsed in the district of Cocody in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's biggest city. The incident took place around half-past midnight on Monday, the fire department said. A search operation is ongoing within the security perimeter established at the site. Despite rescuers' efforts, witnesses say some people are still trapped in the rubble. The 28-apartment building was inaugurated only two years ago but some of its tenants say big cracks were visible in the construction. Authorities say an investigation will be opened. The Minister of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning, Bruno Nabagne Kone, has visited the site. After expressing his condolences, he commented on Twitter that these accidents were preventable if people were more responsible. He added his ministry will continue to demolish dangerous constructions. Another building collapsed a week ago in another Abidjan district, Treichville, killing seven people. A year ago, the minister deplored that most of the constructions carried out in Abidjan did not have a building permit.
