An estimated 2.8 million Kenyans are facing starvation due to prolonged drought. The affected regions are mostly in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands, which cut across 23 counties. To alleviate the situation, the government has stepped in with food aid as a stop-gap measure. According to the government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna, the state has so distributed 55,000 bags of rice, 42,000 bags of beans and 220 cartons of canned meat to vulnerable households in the affected counties. The food aid will run alongside the cash transfers, hunger safety net and livestock off-take programmes This is a noble cause but is not a long-term solution to food insecurity. Year in year out, the government has to step in and provide food aid to hunger-stricken Kenyans. Studies have proved that there is a correlation between food aid and food insecurity. It breeds laziness and creates a dependency syndrome. Food aid has also in some instances been turned into gravy trains by some government officials who trade in the donations. What Kenya needs are scientific methods and policies for increased production to alleviate dependency on food aid. It is therefore good to note, according to Oguna, that the government is working on resilience programmes to ensure that in future, citizens in drought-prone areas will be able to sustain themselves. The sooner this is done the better, as this will end the food aid dependency by residents in ASALs. Quote of the Day: "Before anything else, preparation is the key to success."
