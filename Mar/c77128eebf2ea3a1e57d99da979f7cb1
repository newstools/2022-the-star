Wiper democratic party leader Kalonzo Musyokaon Thursday suffered a major political setback after Borabu Mp Ben Momanyi, who is elected on the Wiper democratic ticket, ditched him for Raila Odinga. Momanyi who is the legal advisor of the Wiper party went against his party boss by also supporting Raila’s bid for the presidency. While defecting, Momanyi said he is now officially an ODM member. Momanyi was handed over to Raila by the Suna East MP Junet Mohammed and the former Gatanga Mp Peter Kenneth. With the defection of Momanyi who is serving his second term, he could now battle it out with the ODM national treasurer Timothy Bosire for the ODM ticket in the primaries. Junet described the defection of Momanyi as a big catch for the ODM party. Wiper democratic party vice-chairman Victor Swanya who was present said that the defection of Momanyi had caught him by surprise. “I could not believe my eyes and ears when I heard and saw Momanyi denouncing our party for ODM." Swanya, however, ruled out Momanyi becoming the ODM flag bear for the ODM gubernatorial arguing that had been fixed politically. “Momanyi cannot be the ODM choice for the seat of the governor.The truth of the matter is that Bosire is the ODM’S choice for the seat. Unless Momanyi wants to be Bosire’s running mate,"  Swanya stated. When receiving Momanyi, Raila said that he has seen the light and challenged other leaders who are still doubting his leadership to join him for a better Kenya. ”Am indeed impressed that the people of Nyamira county have joined other communities in Nyanza province by making sure that were are together in matters of politics and economics," he stated.
