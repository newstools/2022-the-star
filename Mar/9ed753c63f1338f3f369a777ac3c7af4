Strathmore University are going for nothing short of Super Cup glory when the tournament throws off this weekend at Nyayo Stadium. Coach Peter Mwathi said the students are taking the tournament with the seriousness it deserves in their quest for their first tournament of the year. Strathmore are in Group ‘B’ alongside GSU and Kenyatta University (KU). “These teams are good we have a lot of respect for them,” Mwathi noted. “We must, therefore, prepare well for them.” He said they will strive to ensure all the systems work and everyone understands his role in both attack and defence. “We played KU in December in Bungoma during the Kenya University games and we tested our new defensive model and I am glad it worked,” said Mwathi. Strathmore, runners up behind Nationals Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) in the Premier League, boast of good defensive systems. Mwathi, who also handles the national team, said his main focus is to reach the semis. “We respect the teams in Group ‘A’ too. They are the teams we lost to during the just-ended season, denying us the league title,” observed Mwathi. The three-week event, the start of the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) calendar, involves ten teams — six for men and four for women. In Group ‘A’ are national men’s champions NCPB, KDF and Black Mamba. The women’s category has national and regional champions Nairobi Water Queens, KDF, Nanyuki and NCPB.
