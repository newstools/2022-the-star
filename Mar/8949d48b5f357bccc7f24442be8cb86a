A suspect police believe is the mastermind behind disappearances of new generation passports from job recruitment agencies has been arrested. Stephen Obiero was arrested on Friday evening and 22 passports recovered from his possession. DCI director George Kinoti said preliminary investigations have revealed that the passports are sold to West Africans who are in the country illegally, each at Sh22,000. This means that he has earned Sh484,000 for the 22 passports, police said. "The detectives who had done their homework posed as pidgin speaking West Africans and lured the thug to a matatu along Mfangano street where the transaction took place," Kinoti said. "Unbeknownst to the thug, he was dealing with multilingual undercover agents, speaking a mixture of Yoruba and broken English." Kinoti said once the deal was sealed, Obiero was arrested and is currently in police custody. "Most of the passports recovered belong to young female Kenyans who had deposited them at recruitment agencies, for job opportunities in the gulf states," he said. The immigration detectives are currently tracing the owners of the passports. The suspect is currently in custody at Central police station pending arraignment on Monday, March 7, 2022.
