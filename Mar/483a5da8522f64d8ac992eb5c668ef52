A 34-year-old man slashed his 85-year-old uncle to death in Lugari sub-county, Kakamega County, over witchcraft claims. Wamunga Neulula is reported to have also attempted to attack his wife, who was at her parents' home, after killing his uncle, Abdi Muya Tuesday. Chevaywa Chief Alex Goricho told the Star that the suspect reportedly attacked his uncle with a machete, killing him on the spot. He said Muya was returning home when he met his death. Goricho said the suspect killed his uncle on suspicion that he had bewitched him not to live in peace with his wife. He said Neulula had gone to his parents-in-law's home to harm his wife. “After failing to find his wife, he dumped the machete he had used to kill his uncle in his father-in-law's compound before surrendering himself to area assistant chief Manasseh Watambamala,” he said. The administrator arrested him and handed him over to the Sango police. The body was taken to Webuye hospital mortuary. Angry sons of the deceased man raided the suspect’s home and burnt his house. Under the Luhya customary laws, a man who commits murder has his home destroyed to drive out the bad omen. The suspect is also banished from society. Meanwhile, the body of a Standard Seven pupil, who drowned four days ago, has been retrieved from the Nzoia River. The deceased's mother, Joyce Walela, said her son, Collins Wangamati, a pupil at Namawanga primary school in Bungoma County, had gone with his friends to graze animals in Lugari forest and decided to swim in the river when he drowned. The body was retrieved by local divers after four days.
