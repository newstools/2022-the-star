Fitness trainer Frankie has a message for his three-month-old daughter. In a recent interview with SPM Buzz, the father of four was asked to speak about raising a baby girl. Frankie said he was a bit more gentle to his daughter, unlike to his sons. "You know with boys, you will be quick even when doing things like changing diapers. But with the girl, you take more care." When asked what value he will instill in his daughter, Frankie said he would ask her to never depend on a man. "Just that. She can depend on me." On how he handles social media pressure and trolls, Frankie said he blocks them. Frankie welcomed his first daughter with socialite Corazon Kwamboka late last year. The couple has since broken up.
