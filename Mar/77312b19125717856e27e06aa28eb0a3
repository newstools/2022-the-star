A super-yacht priced at $600m (£445m) has been seized by German authorities from its Russian billionaire owner Alisher Usmanov, according to reports. The 512ft (156m) vessel, named Dilbar, was seized in Hamburg, according to Forbes magazine. Usmanov, a metal tycoon, is one of 25 prominent Russians who have been sanctioned by the EU over their ties to the Russian government. Other Russian-owned yachts have been seen flocking to the Maldives, an island nation in the Indian Ocean that does not have an extradition treaty with the US.
