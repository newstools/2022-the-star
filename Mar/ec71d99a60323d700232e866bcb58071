The 2022 Kenya Basketball Federation season will throw off next month, said KBF secretary general Ambrose Kisoi. Kisoi revealed that the delay has been necessitated by a Game Five semi-final impasse involving Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Equity Bank. The match was halted after the bankers walked out against the porters with 59 seconds left on the clock citing security concerns at the Makande Hall, Mombasa. KPA were leading 66-54. Equity Bank — citing crowd trouble — petitioned KBF, who set up a Leagues and Competitions Committee meeting that decided the game be replayed. KPA appealed the decision. “We want to have this matter settled, preferably by the weekend, so that we can start the finals. Were not for this case, we would have been through with the league,” said Kisoi. “This matter must be concluded before we can set the dates for the new season but next month looks the most likely date.” KBF named a seven-man independent disciplinary team led by veteran coach George Namake to solve the impasse. The other members of the team are Agina Wesonga, Henry Shihemi, Albert Masiolo, Jacob Mbijiwe, Wilkister Oduor and Pamela Sinda. Kisoi asked both teams to avail information that might help in expediting the case. Four KBF leagues have already been concluded with KPA beating fierce rivals, Equity Bank Hawks, 3-1 to reclaim the women’s Premier League crown. It was their 15th title. Zetech University Titans, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Stray Cats (men) and Eldonets (women) have also been crowned champions in their respective divisions.
