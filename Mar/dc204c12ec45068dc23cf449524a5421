Bidco FC head coach Anthony Akhulia has expressed concerns following his side’s seven-match winless streak. Speaking after his team's 3-1 loss to hosts Kakamega Homeboyz at Bukhungu Stadium on Sunday, Akhulia now wants his charges to work harder in rediscovering their form. He fears that they might be entangled in the relegation dogfight should they continue throwing crucial points, as they did against Homeboyz. "We were poor against Homeboyz, especially in the first half. We had a lot of individual mistakes which saw us punished heavily," said Akhulia. "We need a lot of concentration in the entire 90 minutes.  We have been starting our matches at a low pace, something that gives our opponents time to score early and lock the game. This is an area we need to improve on." "We will sit down with the players and find ways to tie the loose ends that have been leaving us badly exposed, like poor communication," added Akhulia. He revealed that he has enough time to prepare the team for their next assignment, against City Stars. The Thika-based side are 14th on the log with 20 points from 19 matches.
