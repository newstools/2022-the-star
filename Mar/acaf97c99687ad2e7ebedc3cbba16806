A 20-year-old girl was on Tuesday morning killed by a speeding Bungoma county government ambulance at Bukembe market. Elizabeth Namikoye sustained head injuries. She died on the spot. The ambulance was heading towards Webuye. Bungoma South police commander Benjamin Kimwele condemned the incident, urging ambulance drivers to avoid unnecessary speeding along the Webuye-Malaba highway. “If you do not have an urgent issue or taking a patient to the hospital, do not speed. The highway is busy and children always crossing the road,” Kimwele said. He said the police had started investigations to identify if the girl was a student or not. Kimwele said residents could not identify her at the time of the accident. The police commander said Namikoye's body was moved to the Bungoma County Referral Mortuary awaiting autopsy. He said the ambulance is at the Bungoma police station awaiting inspection by the National Transport and Safety Authority. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
