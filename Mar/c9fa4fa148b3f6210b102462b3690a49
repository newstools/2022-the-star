MCK chairman Maina Muiruri has urged the government to protect journalists during the electioneering period. Speaking in Kirinyaga town on Thursday, he said journalists’ safety and security in their line of duty must be guaranteed by the State security machinery. Muiruri was distributing MCK branded safety wear to Kirinyaga based journalists to be used during the election activities' coverage. Over 30 accredited media personnel got denim jackets and caps with the ‘press’ logo and copies of the Code of Conduct for Practice of Journalism in Kenya. The Kirinyaga County Commissioner Mr Jim Njoka was present during the activity. Commissioner Njoka encouraged the media to carry out its duty in a responsible and balanced manner as the government ensures their security. He told the journalists to report any incidents of harassment or intimidation for intervention. The event comes days after the Media Council of Kenya appointed an inter-media team to coordinate the safety and protection of journalists ahead of the August 9 polls. MCK will work to support the team which includes editors, heads of content to develop protocols and practical working modes to ensure that journalists and other media workers are protected during the election period. DPP Noordin Haji said that the government will protect journalists but prosecute anyone who uses freedom of speech to perpetuate violence, during the International Day to Eradicate Impunity for cases against journalists (IDEI), on November 3, 2021 The initiative taken by MCK seeks to advocate for safety for the media personnel who are faced with the increase in threats during this period.
