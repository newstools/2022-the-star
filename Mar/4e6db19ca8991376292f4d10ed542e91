We've been bringing you pictures and updates on a huge explosion in Kharkiv, a place which has special significance for Ukrainians. It is the country's second-largest city, and the first capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic set up by the Bolsheviks. It is home to some of Ukraine's most important industry, including a tank factory, as well as numerous IT companies. This morning, a missile struck its very heart in Freedom Square just outside the regional administration offices. Speaking shortly after the attack, the head of the regional administration, Oleh Synehubov, called it a "treacherous war crime".
