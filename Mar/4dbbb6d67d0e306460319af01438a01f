When it comes to a butternut squash, many people use it to make chapatis, mandazi or even baby food. But another way you can enjoy this delicacy which has a mildly sweet, slightly nutty and buttery flavour, is when you roast it. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees then spray a rimmed 18 by 13-inch baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Step 2 Place the cubed butternut squash on a baking sheet, drizzle evenly with olive oil. Step 3 Sprinkle with rosemary, thyme, sage and season with salt and pepper to taste. Combine to coat well then spread into an even layer. Step 4 Roast for 20 minutes in preheated oven 20 minutes without opening the oven door. Step 5 Remove from the oven then add garlic and toss and combine. Step 6 Return to oven and roast until soft, about 10 minutes. Ensure it doesn’t brown a lot. Step 7 Enjoy over fried fish or chicken with friends and family.
