Kabras head coach Jerome Muller wants his side to improve on their defence ahead of the semis and final of the Kenya Cup this weekend. The sugar-millers face Strathmore Leos in the semis on Saturday.  The South African tactician watched as his side's unbeaten run came to an end in a 28-20 defeat to champions KCB last weekend. “Our line speed on defence was slow. We gave KCB too many opportunities to reset their attacking line and we fell behind at half-time. We then made a few tweaks and in the second half, we were competitive and fought until the end,” added Muller. Muller, however, took issue with the officiating, insisting that it needs to improve at the semifinal and final stage. He cited an incident, where KCB winger Alvin Otieno on attack led with his elbow to his opposite number Derrick Ashiundu, which according to the rules should have been a red card. Muller said his players were constantly penalised by centre referee Noreen Liyosi with three of them ending up in the sin bin. “We fought hard from 23-6 down to 23-20 but we got a third yellow card with ten minutes to go and this really halted our momentum from winning the match,” he said. The tactician claimed that poor officiating in the league matches has been a norm since the season started. “ I'm in a coaches forum and we are all complaining about the poor decisions by the referees. We send clips to the Kenya Rugby Referees Society but nothing is ever done,” added Muller. He hinted at minimal changes in as far as his team is concerned ahead of the semifinal against Strathmore at Kakamega Showground. The two sides met at the same stage of last season with Kabras winning 39-10. Earlier in the group phase this season, Muller's charges came out tops winning 32-3.
