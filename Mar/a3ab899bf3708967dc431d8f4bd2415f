A woman who bit off her boyfriend's ear because he only gave him Sh100 for fare has been charged with causing grievous harm. Zainab Ochero was charged on Tuesday before Kibera senior principal magistrate Charles Mwaniki. She denied the charges. The charge sheet says that she committed the offence on February 21 in Kangemi, Nairobi County. According to the police, the woman attacked the man by biting off his right ear which fell on the ground. The police said that the man picked his ear, put it in a paper bag and was escorted to a nearby hospital by the Good samaritans. The police say that the man was told to seek further treatment at another hospital in Eastlands, where he was told that the ear was completely damaged and needed plastic surgery after three months of treatment. Zainab told the police that she was angered by the complainant’s accusations that she was in another affair and also the victim refused to book for her a bodaboda to Kawangware. She told the police that the complainant gave her only Sh100 for the fare. The woman denied the charges and was released on an Sh300,000 bond with the surety of the same amount. The magistrate directed that the matter be mentioned on March 16.
