Teachers union secretary general Collins Oyuu has asked the state to intensify security in bandits prone areas, to give candidates ample time to write their exams. The Kenya National Union of Teachers boss said as the election nears, the government should ensure schools are protected from banditry attacks. Oyuu sentiments come barely two weeks after bandits in Elgeyo Marakwet attacked a school bus killing the driver and injuring 13 students and two teachers at night. “I ask Interior CS Fred Matiang'i and his Education counterpart George Magoha to ensure learners are safe. We do not want to lose more students,” he said on Monday in Bungoma. Oyuu alo thanked the teachers for being patient, despite the squeezed education calendar occasioned by Covid-19. “Teachers should be appreciated for the good and their welfare be looked into,” he said. “Knut is still holding conversations with the Teachers Service Commission.” The secretary general urged teachers to remain patient. “I am here for you, don't be misguided by some teachers who have been plunged into politics,” he said. Oyuu asked parents, teachers and the community to support candidates, as sitting exams was not an easy task. The secretary general said the economy has tremendously improved asking the government to allocate more funds for the Education docket. Bungoma South Knut executive secretary Ken Nganga urged other unionists to support Oyuu’s administration. Nganga said Oyuu was performing slightly well in fighting for their welfare.
