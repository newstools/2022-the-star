The Archbishop of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri Anthony Muheria has warned politicians against donating money emanating from criminal activities to churches. Speaking at Our Lady of Consolata Catholic Cathedral in Nyeri town during Ash Wednesday, Muheria said it was every Christian's responsibility to ensure such money does not find its way to churches. "And I always say, I wish I had a litmus paper that I can use to separate such money. It is not always about the amount, it's about its source that could be questionable,” he said. He further warned the congregants against engaging in corruption and other vices. “But also let us not point fingers. Our goal should be to uproot the vice," he said. His sentiments come days after President Uhuru Kenyatta accused some churches of accepting donations emanating from corruption proceeds. Muheria further urged church leaders to treat all contestants equally and also pray for them privately, without pretence and hypocrisy. He told Christians to pray for peace during the campaign and elections period and urged politicians to refrain from using abusive language and hate speech while on their campaign trail. He ushered in the Ash Wednesday which marked the beginning of the lent period when Catholics fast and pray. “First and foremost is an invitation to all of us to change our ways, repent... And this period is for all of us, both leaders and citizens, to change our ways,” he said. He also said that this is also time to pray for peace, not only in the country but also in Ukraine just as Pope Francis had urged Christians to do. Ukraine has been at war with Russia for the past seven days, with heavy attacks on the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of "state terrorism." after he claimed hundreds had been killed.
