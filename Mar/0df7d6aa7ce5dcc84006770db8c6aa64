President Yoweri Museveni's son has not retired from the Ugandan army despite his social media announcement, the army says. Army spokesperson Brig Gen Felix Kulaigye said Lt Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also the commander of Uganda's land forces, is still active and has not even applied for retirement. Gen Kainerugaba, widely believed to be Museveni's successor, on Tuesday posted on Twitter that he had retired from the army after 28 years of service. Hours after the tweet went viral, a video of the "First Son" with his close friend, journalist Andrew Mwenda, was released. In it Gen Kainerugaba insisted he will only retire in eight years. Mwenda said the retirement tweet was an error by Gen Kainerugaba's social media handlers. Despite the denials, many Ugandans continue to believe that Gen Kainerugaba has resigned to succeed his father in the next presidential election. This is not the first time that Gen Kainerugaba has posted controversial tweets that raised criticism of him as both a military commander and the president's son.
