Champions Tusker will seek to close in on leaders Kakamega Homeboyz when they dare Wazito in a tricky Kenyan Premier League round 21 fixture this afternoon at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The brewers have exhibited a growing urge to defend their title after jutting out their claws in their recent fixtures. They may have kicked off the season on a torrid note, but Tusker's resilience ultimately paid off in a special way. Although they sit in a distant third with 34 points — nine adrift of Homeboyz — coach Robert Matano's charges could topple Nairobi City Stars from the second position if they manage maximum points. The two sides are separated by a solitary point. After experiencing a free fall in the initial phases of the season, the so-called moneybags seem to have ultimately rediscovered their lost mojo to remain afloat in the cutthroat competition. The appointment of Mike Ambani to replace Francis Kimanzi as head coach a month ago handed the team a lifeline as they rose from the ashes of defeat to register some positive results. The encounter will be preceded by another mouthwatering clash between last season's runners-up KCB and debutants Kenya Police. The coach John Bobby Ogolla-led law enforcers are yet to assert their authority in the top tier even after investing heavily in quality and experience during the last transfer window. They boast of enough depth in former Simba SC creative midfielder Francis Kahata, former Gor Mahia fleet-footed forward Clifton Miheso as well as seasoned centre-back Harun Shakava. On the other hand, the bankers have seen their fortunes take a dip in recent weeks, with a motley of losses and draws leaving them sixth on the log with 32 points. A win could fire them to either second or third depending on how the brewers fare in their match against Wazito.
