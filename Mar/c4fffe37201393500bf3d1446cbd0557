World Relay 2x2x400m team silver medalist Naomi Korir says she wants to repay the faith shown by Athletics Kenya in her by performing well at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbia on March 18-20. The promising runner said she wants to lower her personal best in what will be her second time competing at the Indoor competition. "I am very grateful to the federation for believing in me and giving me another opportunity to represent the country after making my international debut at the All Africa Games in 2019. I hope to register a good time ahead of outdoor championships like Africa Senior Championships as well as World Championships," Korir said. Korir, who won silver alongside Olympic 800m silver medalist Ferguson Rotich in 2x2x400m mixed relays, said her preparations have been thus far on point. “My preparations to compete in Serbia are in high gear. I am ready to perform well in what will be my second time to compete indoors,”  Korir, who trains under Henry Lebo, said. She further hopes to follow in the footsteps of her role model, 2013 world 800m champion Eunice Sum, who was the captain for Team Kenya at the Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. “When it comes to young athletes like me, I have a good chance and I believe that if I prepare well, I will get a chance to compete for Kenya at the championships since I have competed in Athletics Kenya meetings,” she said.
