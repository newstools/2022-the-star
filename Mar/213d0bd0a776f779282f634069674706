The National Construction Authority has began investigating circumstances that led to the collapse of a building in Kinoo, Kiambu County Sunday morning. A statement by Executive Director Maurice Akech said the site has been condoned off by the National Police Service as investigations get underway. "A full report will be issued once comprehensive investigations are concluded, Akech said. According to Akech, who is also the registrar of contractors, the investigations are being conducted by a multi-agency team comprising of NCA officials, the National Building Inspectorate and the National Disaster Management Unit. "Efforts are underway to ensure safety of the adjacent building and the surrounding development is not affected," Akech said. The building is leaning dangerously on another building that had already been occupied. Tenants of the occupied building were evacuated safely. This is the fourth building to collapse within Kiambu County  in six months, putting the county Lands, Housing and Physical Planning Department in the spotlight yet again. On October 17, 2021, a nine-storey building that was under construction collapsed in Kiambu's OJ area at around 3am. There were no casualties. The incident came barely a month after two other buildings collapsed in Gachie and Kinoo. The incident prompted Kiambu Governor James Nyoro to form a task force to evaluate the structural status of buildings under construction within the county. The team included the National Construction Authority, Surveyors of Kenya and Board of Engineers in Kenya who were to embark on the fact-finding mission.
