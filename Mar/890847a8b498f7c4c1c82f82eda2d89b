Corazon Kwamboka has praised her baby daddy Frankie for being a present dad one week after their breakup. She announced that she and the baby daddy of her two kids, Frankie, were done as a couple. "Cheers to supporting fathers," she wrote. "Us moms can't even be able to take such breaks if we didn't have dads willing to step up no matter the situation. Frankie Kiarie, I appreciate you." In another post, she spoke on her motherhood journey and declared that she didn't care what people thought of the way she does it. "Dessing up, having wine, using formula, taking vacays," she wrote. "I dictate the rules of my 'motherhood'. Besides, a happy mum is a better mum. That said, I miss my children, but I'm looking forward to the first uninterrupted night in over 70 days."
