Gospel singer Ndume is back with an uplifting track called 'Wapi'. Speaking on the motive behind the song, Ndume said he wanted to inspire people. “I wrote 'Wapi' to encourage everyone to be grateful and hopeful as they manoeuvre this tough and demanding world we live in," he said. "It is to encourage you that there is hope, that you are not alone, that there is light at the end of the tunnel. In the midst of our struggles, let us keep praising and thanking God." The hip hop musician and dancer has worked with the likes of Viki Pondis, Teddy B and Alexis on the Beat. Last year, Ndume teamed up with Kaka Empire for a classic titled Nyororo, which features super-talented singer and producer Bern Mziki.
