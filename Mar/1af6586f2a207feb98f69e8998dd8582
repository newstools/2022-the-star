Socialite Zari Hassan's new man GK Choppa pursued her for three years. Speaking in Uganda, Zari said Choppa was persistent as he would send her gifts to win her heart. "I didn’t give him attention. But after some time, I decided to meet him and I realised he has a good heart. He is a good guy," she said. Choppa has been pampering Zari with sweet words as he shared their romantic moments on Instagram. He is a Ugandan businessman based in South Africa as well. Zari also clarified that she has not reconciled with her baby Daddy Diamond Platnumz. "I swear, we have not been in bed together for a long time," she said. "We are just friends now and I have now grown to like him more than even when we were lovers."
