Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak says that "with a great regret" the latest talks between Russia and Ukraine "haven't achieved the results we were hoping for". But he says the two sides agreed to continue negotiations in "the nearest future". "The only thing I can say is that we discussed the humanitarian aspect in detail because quite a lot of cities are now surrounded," he says. The invasion enters the eighth day, as Russian President Vladimir Putin says his "special military operation" - otherwise known as Russia's invasion of Ukraine - is "going according to plan". His claim comes despite many analysts suggesting the invasion has not gone to plan. In a televised speech, he accused Ukrainian forces of taking "thousands of foreign citizens hostage" and using civilians as "human shields" - he provided no evidence for these claims. Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil is calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine. In a statement on its website, the company said it was concerned by the "tragic events in Ukraine" and supported the negotiations to end the conflict. Its board called for "the immediate cessation of the armed conflict and fully supports its resolution through the negotiation process and through diplomatic means".
