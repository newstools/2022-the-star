"It has been noted that some schools are violating the religious rights of learners and using religion as an excuse to either deny admission or expel learners from school," Jwan said. He said this violation comes in the form of prohibition of religious attire and forcing students to take a certain religious subject. Violation also includes "denying learners an opportunity to observe religious rites and prayers, failure to allocate worship rooms and forcing learners to participate in activities contrary to their religion," he added. In religious education studies, learners have to choose which subject falls under their religion. For instance, Christians take Christian Religious Education, Muslims take Islamic Religious Education while Indian students pursue Hindu Religious Education.
