Former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has pleaded with NATO to reconsider imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He questioned why that has been done in other waring countries and not Ukraine. "Why you can do that in Libya? Why you can do that in many other countries?" asked former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko. He noted that the ongoing fight is not for only for freedom and democracy, but for the security of Europe. "This is the war in Europe and Ukraine is fighting not only for our own land. Not only for the freedom. Not only for democracy. Not only for the Western values, but we're fighting for the security of Europe."
