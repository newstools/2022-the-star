The Nairobi Hospital is in talks with the United Nations to convert its Covid-19 facility into an infectious diseases research centre. The facility for UN Africa workers was opened in November 2020 to serve Covid-19 patients. The agreement was the UN will build 100 beds with a foundation to increase to 300 beds and the Nairobi Hospital to build 35 beds out of the old school of nursing. The facility was constructed in three months at $8 million (Sh912,342,621) The talks to convert the facility into a research centre begun in November last year but the presence of the Omicron variant stopped the plan, the hospital chief executive James Nyamongo said. “From November last year we wanted to convert it to a different thing, we were under discussions with the UN. Once we are done with this wave, we will look at the long term,” Nyamongo said on Wednesday. “We have to discuss with the UN to see what is the best use we can apply this facility because it is a huge investment with about 135 beds. The UN contributed 100 beds and that is a collaboration so we need to have dialogue.” United Nations Office Nairobi director general Zainab Bangura said the rapid construction of the treatment facility was an example of what was possible when the UN, government and the private sector joined forces to confront global challenges. “Unlike many other facilities built as part of humanitarian response efforts, this hospital is designed to remain active and serve Kenya and the region beyond the Covid-19 pandemic and for many years to come,” she said. The CEO said the idea came in because Covid disease was new to the region and being an infectious disease there was a need to separate from the ordinary disease to the Covid issues for easy management. “The theatre is good and the Xray is one of the best, so we need to look into it,” she said.
