Kenya Airways is planning a route network review that will affect a few of the routes in its network. This is part of its recovery plan from the Covid -19 pandemic that saw the aviation industry record loses from travel restrictions. KQ plans to increase frequency for London route throughout Winter from planned five times weekly to daily marking the fastest recovery to pre-Covid schedule. Juba-Khartoum route operation day has been changed to Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays to cater for Sudan Weekends (Fridays and Saturdays) effective Feb 20. Nairobi-Kisumu flights will be scaled down from 26 times to 17 times weekly over low season. This will take effect from Feb 15. The airways has also postponed Milan and Rome flight launch previously planned for June 8 this year. According to KQ, the postponement is in light of reduced passenger demand as a result of slower than expected recovery from the pandemic. "We continue to serve Italy through our Europe and destinations: London, Paris, and Amsterdam connecting to our Sky Team Partner Airlines, ITA(Italia Trasporto Aereo) and Air France-KLM.5," the airways said in a statement on Monday. All flights destined for Yaoundé, Cameroon will also be suspended by  May 31.
