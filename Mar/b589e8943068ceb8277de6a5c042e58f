Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has maintained that the Azimio La Umoja camp is not an option for him as the country heads to the August 9, polls. Speaking in Kiambu County on Tuesday during the burial of the mother to the former Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu, Kuria said he will always be on the winning side. "... Kuna kitu ninajua, pengine sijui pahali niliko lakini najua pahali siko (I might not know where I am, but I know where I can't be),” Kuria said. He continued that: “Unajua kwa hii uhai mimi ndio ninajiamulia, hakuna siku utanipata kwa Azimio…lakini hata nikikufa, msinipeleke kwa Azimio (In this life, I’m the one to make the decision about my direction, you’ll never see me in Azimio…and even if I die, don’t take me to Azimio).” Kuria, who is the leader of the Chama Cha Kazi party, has been unpredictable in his 2022 coalition formation. Recently, Kuria met with OKA principals and said they had agreed to work together. He said he informed them that he won't join them if they team up with Azimio. The MP said that Jubilee Party’s popularity in the region will end soon. “Jubilee itasahaulika kama duka ya kamisi.” He also lauded Waititu for the friendship they have had for a long time, adding that they have both been jailed for defending for fighting for the citizens. DP’s allies flagged the event, being led by the Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula. Kuria, expressed his confidence for the gubernatorial seat, asking the incumbent Governor James Nyoro to be ready to hand over the office to him.
