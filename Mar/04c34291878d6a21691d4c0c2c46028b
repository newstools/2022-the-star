Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has warned examination center managers and invigilators against carrying phones to the exam rooms. On Monday, Magoha said a number of teachers were caught sending photos of exam papers after the exam had started. "We caught certain center managers taking photos of examination papers, about 39 minutes after the exam had started," Magoha said. He warned the managers to ensure all civilians involved in the administration of the exams leave behind their phones. Magoha was speaking after supervising the distribution of exam materials at the Nyeri Central KNEC container. "Center managers must keep their phones in the offices and they must ensure that all the invigilators and supervisors leave their cellphones in the office," Magoha said. Magoha added that a few individuals are out to hinder the smooth flow of the KCPE exam. "This is not acceptable and we are not going to take it lightly," he added. Science, Kiswahili, and Insha will be administered on Tuesday while Social Studies will be done on Wednesday. This year the council registered 1,225,507 candidates in 28,316 KCPE examination centres as compared to 1,191,752 candidates in 28,467 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 33,755 representing 2.75 per cent.
