DJ Creme de la Creme and his wife Denise are back together. They'd been together for 14 years when proposed to her in March last year, but a few months later, Creme said their union was on the rocks. He said marriage is a scam. "Don't let anybody lie to you." In a recent interview on Milele FM, Creme said he regrets reacting with emotions. "I regret saying marriage is a scam. That was driven by emotions, something I highly regret," he said. "It has really cost me so much. I wouldn't have wanted my children to go on social media and read or watch such a thing. They will ask me why did you say marriage is a scam." Creme said his wife is back with their children. "My house needed her. I felt empty without my wife. The feeling is amazing and I love that. I will even add some weight." Asked to speak about what led to their breakup, Creme said time heals a lot of things. "In every relationship, where there is a problem, you feel you are at your worst. You see the other person as the worst thing ever. As time goes by, you realise you cannot do without the other person." In an earlier interview with Word Is, Creme denied infidelity and being broke as the reasons for their breakup. "My wife and I don't fight about women, it was never about that. If we ever fought about women, I would have been affected after the last scandal I had," he said. "It was also not about me being broke. If my wife was to leave me because I'm broke, she would have not even settled with me since I knew her when I had nothing."
