Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has officially joined the United Democratic Alliance party. The MP availed himself at the UDA party offices in Nairobi on Wednesday to seek clearance to participate in the party primaries scheduled for April. In his statement on the latest move, Keter called for the need to exercise political tolerance in this electioneering period. " There should be no bitterness or hate where the truth and righteousness exist. Those who stand for nothing fall for anything. My appeal to the people of Kenya is to be self-driven guided by law to tolerate political ideologies without hate," Keter said. He at the same time expressed commitment to campaigning for Ruto's presidential bid saying he is certain of his victory. "We are now ready to soldier on the 2022 presidential bid and move to all counties of Kenya to seek and solicit more votes to make my brother William Samoei Ruto the fifth president of Kenya," he added. He was welcomed by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua. Gachagua said his entry is part of a continued mass exodus from the ruling Jubilee party. "At the Hustler Center, this afternoon I have welcomed the Hon. Alfred Keter, Nandi Hills Member of Parliament to the Party of the moment and the future. The mass exodus from Jubilee to UDA continues," he said. Keter was elected as MP on a Jubilee party ticket in the 2017 polls. He will be seeking his third term on the UDA party ticket. The MP is known to be one of the former critics of deputy president William Ruto from the Rift Valley region. His move to join the DP seemingly seeks to ensure he aligns his ambitions to the expectation of his voters on the ground. Keter is one of the MPs who hardly frequent the DP's Karen residence for meetings. He has however gone slow on his attack at Ruto and has already declared his support for his presidential bid.
