Lasagna is an Italian delicacy that dates in the 14th to 19th century. The dish mostly contains three to four layers of pasta, meat fillings and cheese. Tomato first appeared in the recipe for the first time in the 18th century. You can substitute tomato sauce with a tomato paste and add corn starch or flour to thicken the sauce. Ingredients Tomato Sauce Preparation Step 1 Preheat your oven to 350°F. Cook pasta according to package directions then rinse under cold water. Step 2 Heat the ground beef, onion and garlic until brown. Step 3 Stir in pasta sauce (step 1), tomato paste and Italian seasoning for at least 5 minutes. Step 4 To make the cheese mixture, combine 1½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, and egg. Step 5 In a pan, put a cup of the beef mixture and spread evenly then add a layer of the Lasagna noodles, top off with the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers at least two or three times. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce. Step 6 Cover the pan with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Step 7 Uncover, sprinkle the remaining cheese (2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan) and bake an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Step 8 Let it rest for about 15 minutes before serving to avoid it falling apart.
