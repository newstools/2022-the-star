More than Sh300,000 was sent to Samburu Governor Moses Lenolkulal from one of his agents in the Sh84 million fuel supply scandal, EACC says. The Sh339,000 was sent by one Hesbon Ndathi who is also an accused person in the case. Ndathi was the man in charge of Oryx service station, owned by Lenolkulal. Details of the M-Pesa transactions are reflected on the report produced in court as an exhibit. The messages date from February 2017 to February 2019. The report was by Alex Kinyanjui, a digital forensic analyst at the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission. Magistrate Thomas Nzioki also allowed the production of Oryx service station documents which the prosecution is relying on to prove the fraud charges levelled against the county chief. The documents include Oryx service station ifmis supplier documents, Oryx ifmis invoices totalling to Sh76 million and Oryx service station ifmis payment totalling to Sh73 million. The governor, businessman Hesbon Ndathi, and nine others are linked to the Sh84.7 million fuel supply scandal. Oryx service station, owned by Lenolkulal was given a tender to supply the county government against the law. It is alleged they committed the offence between March 27, 2013, and March 25, 2019, at Maralal town. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
