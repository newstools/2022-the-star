About 2 years ago, Apple made the decision to not ship the iPhone 12 with a charger, a move that was heavily criticized. Later, Samsung applied the same move to their Samsung S21 series, a move they say might apply to all their smart phones in general. Samsung said that the move is about sustainability, as users can use charger heads and charging cables from past phones. People without the compatible chargers will have an option to buy new chargers and accessories from electronic retailers. Word on the street is that users might also have to buy earphones. Although Samsung has not confirmed all of this officially, it is not hard to accept that this may have some truth in it. Some mobile retailers in Europe have already confirmed that some entry level Samsung phones like Galaxy A13 and A23 may not ship with a charger. What do you think about this move?
