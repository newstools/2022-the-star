A section of bar owners, hoteliers and liquor traders in Kisii are in court to challenge levies imposed by the county on single business permits. They further want the county administration restrained from collecting revenue from all liquor related single business permits or closing their businesses until the matter is heard and determined. In court papers, the traders from Gucha and Suneka sub-counties said they are being overcharged contrary to what is stipulated in the Kisii County Finance Act 2015. Currently, the traders argue, the Act stipulates the fees schedule for a single business permit, but remains silent on liquor license fees. They said the county's invoicing is grossly exaggerated thus giving room for extortion in unrecommended taxes. They say charges are often different despite the applicants doing the same business within Kisii County which they argue is punitive. In a case filed under a certificate of urgency, the  traders said they fear possible closure of their businesses because the respondent has been issuing threats to do so. "It would be prudent that this honourable court issue conservatory orders restraining the respondents or her agents, employees and any other public officer from closing their businesses pending the hearing and determination of the petition herein," argue the traders in the petition filed on Monday. They cite possible financial loses in the face of closures if the respondent carries good its threats. The case comes up for a mention on March 15.
