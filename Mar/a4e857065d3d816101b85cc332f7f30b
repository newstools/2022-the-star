A pregnant KCPE candidate on Tuesday sat her exams at the Kithyoko Health Centre in Endei, Masinga subcounty. The girl, 18, was rushed to the health facility on Monday evening while in labour. A local administrator told the Star the candidate was okay and would sit her final papers on Wednesday. The Ministry of Education officials from the region have, however, declined to comment on the matter. Another candidate on Monday wrote her examination at Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital after she gave birth a day to the examination. The incident was confirmed by Education Principal Secretary Julius Jwan who spoke after he witnessed the opening and distribution of the exam from Kisii Central subcounty to examination centres. The PS said the examination started smoothly and arrangements had been made to ensure the candidate, who hails from Etago subcounty, sits her exam without hitches. “I am happy with the process. We have an adequate number of security officers across the 698 examination centres, the county has 33,140 KCPE candidates sitting the examination,” Jwan said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
