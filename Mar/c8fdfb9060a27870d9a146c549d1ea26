The government has been urged to solve issues that led the world football governing body, Fifa, to ban Kenya from international competitions. Speaking during the Mrembo Na Kazi football tournament launch at Lanet Umoja Primary School grounds, a leader from Bahati Sub-County in Nakuru, Irene Njoki, expressed fear that the ban could discourage hundreds of budding footballers in the country. "As a leader at the grassroots and given Nakuru's deep endowment of sports and other talents, I want to nurture talents but the current Fifa ban discourages the youth because there would be no use of training if they cannot compete at the international level," she said. Njoki asked Sports CS Amina Mohamed to work closely with football stakeholders as they seek viable solutions. "The government, through CS Amina, should initiate talks with Fifa to ensure there is a turnaround of the recent ban," she said. She observed that Nakuru was a basket of talents having produced great footballers such as John Mo, Washington Muhanji, James Odawa, and Joseph Odera. "Together with friends from the United States of America and the Kenya Sports Academy, we want to nurture talent from Bahati and have exchange programmes and scholarships. “This cannot happen if the government does not hasten to lift off the Fifa ban and allow resumption of sporting activities," she said. Njoki said 10 boys from the area had already been earmarked for scholarships in top Kenyan schools through football. Former international footballer David Kenga, who also doubles up as a coach, said the Fifa ban would negatively affect football in Kenya, especially talents at the grassroots.
