Five aspirants are seeking to replace Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, who has declared interest in the Vihiga governor's seat. They are former Vihiga county assembly employee Clement Sloya, former Vihiga medical superintendent Emanuel Ayodi, Nairobi-based businessman Arafat Ikumu and businessman Ibn Kidunduhu. Businessman Alex Kidake on Tuesday told the Star that he has withdrawn from the governor's race and will now seek the Sabatia parliamentary seat on the Ford Kenya ticket. "I withdrew from the race after elders urged me to go for the MP seat," he said. Arafat and Ayodi will battle it out for ANC ticket in the nominations. ANC Vihiga secretary general William Kaisha said they will support whoever will emerge the winner. Sloya will run as an independent candidate. He told the Star on the phone that going to the ballot as an independent candidate will help him unite all supporters of former Governor Moses Akaranga and MP Agoi. Sloya said if he joins ANC, he will lose his supporters in the Progressive Party of Kenya (PPK), which is under Akaranga. Kidunduhu is said to be seeking the ODM party ticket, but information remains scanty on whether he is a party member or not. Vihiga branch ODM chairman Zebeby Osabwa said they have not received any information about Kidunduhu's interest in the party's ticket for the Sabatia MP race. “Our window is still open up to the 13th of this month. Those who want to join ODM are free to submit their documents and we shall welcome them,” Osabwa said. Edited by A.N
