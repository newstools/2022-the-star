Khaligraph Jones is releasing his album 'Invisible Currency' this month. Ahead of the release, he told his fans the album will be a new experience. "Listen, we are going to be raising the bar. We are going to be doing the unimaginable. Everything about this album is super historic." The album drops next week on Monday and has 17 songs, featuring top artistes like Alikiba and Rudeboy. "There is no album that will come out of the 254 in 2022 that is going to surpass what 'Invisible Currency' is going to do," he said. Last month, he told Word Is his music speaks for itself. "It gets to a point in your career you don't need to explain your content. You work hard and leave fans to experience the feeling."
