WhatsApp is a widely used messaging service that is slowly replacing the SMS. For this reason, Meta is having sleepless nights to ensure its WhatsApp users continue having a good experience in the application. Here are a few changes you expect to see on your WhatsApp soon. Group admins can delete chat Group admins will soon be able to delete chat for everyone without permission of the sender. After that, the owner of the deleted chat will be notified through a note. Community group feature This will allow admins to create a group within a group. Voice calls for WhatsApp web users Currently this feature is only available on mobile phones. Soon, you will be able to make and receive calls using your desktop. WhatsApp is also adding voice wave forms for everyone during voice calls. The voice waveform will be like that of a voice note when it’s playing. A 2-Step Verification for WhatsApp Web/Desktop Two-Step Verification is a feature that provides more security to your WhatsApp account. Here you get a PIN (6-digit verification code) via SMS or phone call and it helps prevent unauthorized access. This feature is currently available only on the WhatsApp mobile app but will soon be available on the desktop and web version. Fresh emoji WhatsApp is working on adding animated effects to emoji’s. Just like when someone send a beating heart, emoji’s will have a ‘live’ effect. Message reaction Just like the way you can react to a status on Instagram, you will be able to react to statuses on WhatsApp without directly texting the person. You will only need to tap and hold the message you want to react to, then an emoji will appear below the text message or status. Limit people who see a certain status A new shortcut feature will allow you to edit the list of users who you want to see your status without going to settings. The feature will be on the same line as the caption bar.
