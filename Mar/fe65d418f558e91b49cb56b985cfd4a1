Boda bodas are a social problem in Kenya. They pay scant regard to traffic laws, riding on pavements and the wrong side of the road. A mob can attack you after a minor collision and then last Friday riders sexually assaulted a woman on Forest Road. President Kenyatta understandably ordered a crackdown. About 100 boda boda riders were arrested in Parklands on Tuesday for breaking traffic rules. Now Interior minister Fred Matiangi has given boda operators a lifeline. They can forgo their Sh5,7000 registration fee if they get a smart driving licence, join a Saco and register their bikes. The government is in a tough position. The public are fed up with the misbehaviour of boda bodas. However, they provide a very useful public service, ferrying wananchi swiftly for economical fares. And now in this gig economy, they have become messengers, delivering food and medicine from shops to homes. In short, boda bodas are invaluable. We can't live without them. That is why there are 2.4 million in Kenya. So the government should be commended for pursuing a compromise that keeps them on the road while making them more socially responsible.
