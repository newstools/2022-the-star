In yesterday’s Star, there was a perfect illustration of the parallel narratives of the Ukraine war. On the same page, one column by the Russian ambassador denounced the neo-Nazis in the Ukraine government and next to it a columnist suggested that steroid addiction may have made Putin irrational. Are the two writers living in the same universe? The world is in a lose-lose situation. In Kenya, prices of fuel, bread and fertiliser are about to go through the roof because of the war. The Russia economy will tank because of sanctions. War is destroying the infrastructure of Ukraine which will soon enter a long drawn-out insurgency with no decisive conclusion. President Putin’s popularity is up over 70 percent in the opinion polls so he is unlikely to back down. But Europe is united against the invasion and will also not retreat. Ukraine and the whole world still need peace. The warring parties need to sit down and talk because they become even more divided with each day that passes. We need to seek a peace agreement before it is too late. Quote of the day: "Architecture aims at Eternity." Christopher Wren|The English architect died on March 8, 1723
