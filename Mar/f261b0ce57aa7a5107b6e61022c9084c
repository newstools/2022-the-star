Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has for the first time shared his 2017 pact with ODM party leader Raila Odinga publicly for scrutiny. In the deal seen by the Star on Tuesday,  it was agreed by the duo that Raila shall be NASA's presidential candidate with Kalonzo as running mate. The agreement was signed on April 30, 2017. "Raila agrees in a Public MOU to serve one term and publicly endorse Kalonzo as the presidential candidate for 2022," the deal read. After three years at the presidency, Raila was to delegate substantial national duties to Kalonzo and largely concentrate on international duties. "The two agreed that the delegation of substantial national duties to Kalonzo by Raila after three years shall not be made public as part of the signed document," it read. In the deal, the two agreed to share campaign resources, especially funds for the duration of the 2017 elections. "They agreed to publicly address rallies throughout the country and especially in Nyanza, Western Easter, Rift valley and Coast regions to explain this pact to the people," the deal read. "This will assure that the pact is not a private understanding between Raila and Kalonzo but a social contract between the two  and the people of Kenya." The wiper boss claimed that US-based lawyer Makau Mutua, who he claimed to be the lawyer who witnessed the signing, has refused to call a meeting between him and Raila to look at the 2017 coalition agreement. "I have tried in vain to have Makau Mutua call a meeting with Raila," he said. Kalonzo said Raila has the option of binding with this life binding document to emerge as a national and continental democratic hero or if he doesn't, the move will compound the trust deficit."
