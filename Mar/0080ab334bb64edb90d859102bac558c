Ashun Wu fired a scintillating round of 6 under par 65 to emerge the winner of the iconic Magical Kenya Open at the Muthaiga Golf Club on Sunday. Wu became the first Chinese player to win Kenya’s national open, over and above, the first Asian winner. In winning the Kenya Open, the Chinese pro also savoured his fourth DP World Tour victory in his 158th appearance. His win followed back-to-back birdies on par 4 17th and par 5 18th. Sunday’s performance handed Wu his sixth professional victory, having won twice on the Japan Golf Tour. His stellar play on Kenyan soil ensures he has wins from three continents; Asia (Volvo China Open), Europe (Lyoness Open) and Africa (Magical Kenya Open). It’s double delight for Wu... He won on his debut on the Kenyan round of the DP Tour just 13 weeks after becoming a father for the first time.  He couldn’t have asked for anything better since his wife and child were present at the “Home of Golf” in addition to being awarded by none other than President Uhuru Kenyatta. Hurly Long of Germany, South African  T. Lawrence and Canadian Aaron Cockerill tied for second on 12 under. A total of 156 players took part in the event where Kenya was represented by nine pros and six amatuers. Teenager Njoroge Kibugu was the only Kenyan to make the cut in the four-day strokeplay championship.  LEADERBOARD 1 China) A. Wu -16 T2 (Germany) H. Long  -12 T2 (Canad)a A.
