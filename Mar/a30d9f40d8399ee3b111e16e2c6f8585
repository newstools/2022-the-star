Chaos erupted at the Jubilee's Nakuru party headquarters after aspirants disagreed on the removal of one party official. The disgruntled aspirants had called for a meeting with the officials after they were left out of the nomination registration exercise because of their names missing in the party register. The meeting turned into a fistfight after the former Nakuru Jubilee chairman David Manyara accused the Regional Director Peter Cheruiyot of being the weak link in the party.
