Deputy President William Ruto has been firm on his stand as a Christian when it comes to the LGBTQ community in Kenya. In 201, Ruto said before the church that there is "no room" for homosexuality in the country and that Kenya is a God-fearing nation. His remarks by then came days before the arrival of the then US Secretary of State John Kerry for talks on US-Kenya bilateral ties. But while speaking in the US on Friday, March 4, the DP sounded different, though he said that at a personal level, the Bible teaches him against homosexuality. “My position as a Christian is that Bible teaches us against homosexuality and related matters, that is me as William Ruto,” Ruto said. Ruto spoke on Friday evening during a candid conversation at the Center for Strategic International Studies, which was moderated by Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, who is the Director and Senior Fellow Africa Program. When he was asked about the alleged intimidation against the LGBTQ community, the DP said that everyone should respect the law. He said that if he will be elected as the next president, as a public leader, and as a servant, the Constitution and the law will become the guiding principle. “Whatever is within the Constitution, and the law, I’ll respect. So long as everybody is operating within the law, and within what is permissible within the Constitution, they have nothing to fear because we are the nation governed by the rule of law.” He continued that: “I do not think that nobody should pick up arms against any Kenyan irrespective of whether you like what they are doing or you don’t like. Every Kenyan must be subjected to the rule of law…no Kenyan should be subjected to any harassment or any form of harm.” The DP said that the only authority that can take such action against anybody is the ones that have been permitted by the law. Also, he said that every Kenyan will be safe in his administration, which he said will be operating within the parameters of the law.
