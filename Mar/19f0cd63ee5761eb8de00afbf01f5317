Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has condemned the molestation of a female motorist by bodaboda operators in Nairobi. In a viral video, bodaboda operators are captured sexually assaulting the female motorist allegedly for causing an accident. The incident occurred on Friday, March 4, but the matter came to the limelight on Monday, March 7, 2022, after the video was widely circulated on social media. "I am shocked and disgusted by a viral video clip of a female motorist being molested by suspected bodaboda riders along Wangari Maathai /Forest Road," he said. Matiangi said the government must protect the road users from such vile and reprehensible acts of aggression. "I have asked our security agents to ensure that all the perpetrators of this dastardly act are swiftly apprehended and suitably punished for their heinous act," he said. Energy CS Monica Juma has also weighed into the matter describing it as 'Outrageous - not acceptable'. "All those involved must face the full force of the law. What a shame that no one could help/protect this young woman from this criminal attack in broad daylight?" she posed. "How did our society come to lose all humanity? Really?" One of the operators recorded the drama that ensued where the visibly terrified lady is heard screaming as the riders physically harass her to a point of stripping her naked in a bid to force her out of the vehicle. She said she lost cash and other valuables in the ensuing melee and was only rescued from the hands of the rowdy group by traffic police who were alerted by other motorists who had witnessed the drama. Nairobi traffic boss Joshua Omukata said no arrest had been made so far but investigators are pursuing the matter. He said police are reviewing CCTV footage on the section of the road to help identify those behind the harassment.
