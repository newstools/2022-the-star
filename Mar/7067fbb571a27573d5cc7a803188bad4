Kenya’s Covid-19 positivity rate dropped to 0.3 per cent on Saturday after 14 people tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 5,485 tested in 24 hours. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in a statement that 11 of the new patients are Kenyans while three are foreigners. The youngest among the patients is a two-year old child while the oldest is aged 76 years. According to Kagwe, ten of the patients are from Nairobi County; two are from Nakuru County while Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties each had one case. The CS announced that no patient had succumbed to the disease over a 24 hour period, meaning the death toll remained at 5,640. “Today, five patients have recovered from the disease all of them from the home-based care and isolation. This pushes the total recoveries to 303,329 of whom 250,341 are from the home based care and isolation program while 52,988 are from various health facilities countrywide,” Kagwe said. He said 39 patients are still admitted in various health facilities countrywide while 472 are under home-based care and isolation. One among those in hospital is in ICU on ventilator support, he added. “Another nine patients are on supplementary oxygen and all of them are in general wards. No patient is on high dependency unit,” Kagwe concluded.
