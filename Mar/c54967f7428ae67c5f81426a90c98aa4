Kibabii University on Tuesday joined other Kenyans and the world in celebrating International Women's Day. The event was graced by the institution's Vice-Chancellor Prof. Ipara Odeo. Addressing Journalists after the event, Prof. Odeo urged men to stop mistreating women saying women have a great role to play in society. "Great men are the ones that respect their women in the society. A woman should not be harassed in any way or the other," he said. He noted that his University has also given women opportunities and are running their departments very well. “I can confirm from this University that the women we have given opportunities are running their departments well and this shows that women can deliver. What a man can do, a woman can do better,” he said. He appealed to women to turn up in large numbers and vie for elective seats saying they have a right to lead. He also asked the society to support the boy child saying the male gender has been ignored in efforts to address girls' issues. Odeo pointed out that many parents and guardians have diverted their attention to supporting a girl child. "In this university, I have seen some parents pay fees for girls but neglect boys. I ask them to support them all for the future generation," he said. Rev. Joselyne Isigi, a motivational speaker asked women to stop fighting their men and support them saying that suicidal cases have risen in society. "Now and then we hear suicidal cases among men and women therefore it's my humble appeal to parents and lecturers in our universities to guide students accordingly," he said.
