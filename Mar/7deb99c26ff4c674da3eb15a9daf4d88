Africa’s fastest man, Ferdinard Omanyala, has done it again. The Olympian pulled off another first by setting a new world lead time of 10.00 seconds during the third Athletics Kenya Track and Field field meeting at the Nyayo National Stadium on Saturday. The time is the third fastest time ran on Kenyan soil. “It’s a world lead. 10.00 seconds. Looking forward to a better and great season 2022,” Omanyala said in a tweet. Omanyala beat  Samuel Imeta from Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to second place in 10.36 and Stephen Oluoch, a soldier, finished third in 10.55. Kenya Prisons' Hebson Ochieng clocked 10.56 to finish fourth while Robinson Mutende of KDF placed fifth in 10.71 respectively. The new record is Omanyala’s latest in a series of glass-shuttering achievements for the young athlete in recent days. Omanyala is the reigning African record holder in a time of 9.77. He also ran the second fastest time last year at the Kip Keino Classic, finishing behind American Trayvon Bromell who won the race in 9.76 making him and Omanyala the seventh and eighth fastest men ever in 100m.
