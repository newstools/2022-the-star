The Nairobi County Football Association has written to Sports CS Amina Mohamed asking her to remove Titus Kasuve from the Football Kenya Federation Caretaker Committee. The association has accused the seasoned football administrator of allegedly using his position to advance the agenda of the ousted Football Kenya Federation. The letter to the CS accused Kasuve of appointing a sympathiser of the embattled federation to serve in an influential position in the committee. “He appointed Alfred Ndinya to be the referee's manager in the Caretaker Committee when he clearly knows that he (Ndinya) is an active member of the FKF electoral board,” read the letter in part. The association further took issue with Kasuve's association with FKF Baringo Branch chairman, Kenneth Rutto, claiming he went contrary to the wishes of the Caretaker Committee. “He held an illegal meeting with FKF branch officials on February 25, 2022, at Nyayo Stadium led by Baringo chairman, Kenneth Rutto when he clearly knows that the FKF Caretaker Committee released a press on  December 14, asking clubs to deal with associations and branches that are compliant.” NCFA also accused Kasuve of entertaining individuals who had previously openly opposed decisions made by the CS. “Kasuve has continued to appoint, Kenneth Rutto (chairman, FKF Baringo County) Dickson Angole (chairman FKF Kilifi County), Lilian Nandudu (chairperson FKF Mombasa County), Francis Oliele (chairman FKF Nakuru County), Abdul Kaka (chairman FKF Laikipia County) among other chairmen who have sued you madam, the sports registrar, and the FKF Caretaker Committee in court but they are actively participating in the activities they are against,” read the letter. Kasuve is part of the 15-member committee appointed by the CS in November last year. He serves on the committee as the head of the referees' subcommittee. He was once the vice-chairman of the defunct Football Kenya Limited.
