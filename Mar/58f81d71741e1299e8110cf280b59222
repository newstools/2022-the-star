Media houses in Kenya have been asked to ensure journalists are accredited before the August 9 polls. In an interview with the Star, Media Council of Kenya Western and Nyanza coordinator  Evans Teddy appealed to media houses to ensure their journalists are accredited to ensure credibility and safety during elections coverage. Teddy added that MCK is moving around counties to ensure journalists are accredited. "I will move around Western and Nyanza counties to ensure that all journalists are accredited and become members of the MCK," Teddy said. "We want to encourage professionalism in the media industry." He said MCK will be in Bungoma, Busia, Vihiga, Kakamega and Nyanza counties and urged journalists to turn up and get accredited. The coordinator said the accreditation is very easy since a journalist can log in into the MCK accreditation portal, upload the required documents or even contact MCK officials for guidance. "The world is digital, just visit MCK accreditation portal and my team will approve you the help you need," he said. "Bungoma has developed in the media sector, that is why we have set aside two days for accreditation," he said. "We will also visit Kibabii University to help media students get accredited to enhance their career." He said accreditation is crucial for journalists, media practitioners and students as we head to the elections. "Anyone seeking election information before, during and after polls form the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must be an accredited journalists," he said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
