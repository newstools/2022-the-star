Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has returned to India's squad for the second and final test against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru after recovering from an injury and Covid-19, the country's cricket board (BCCI) said on Tuesday. The 28-year-old played the last of his five test matches against New Zealand in December in Mumbai before a shin injury put him out of contention for the following series. Patel, who has taken 36 wickets and is also a batter down the order, was named in India's three-match Twenty20 squad last month against West Indies but was ruled out after contracting Covid-19. The BCCI said Patel has completed his rehabilitation. Left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who did not find a place in the team that won the opening test at Mohali inside three days, has been released from the squad for the final test, which will be played under lights.
