President Uhuru Kenyatta has congratulated World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei after their win in Tokyo race. "Uhuru has congratulated Kipchoge and Kosgei for their sterling performance in their respective races at the Tokyo Marathon 2021," State House said on Sunday. Uhuru said the two dominated their races setting the fastest times ever ran on Japan soil in their respective races. His deputy William Ruto also congratulated the two for the wins. "Congratulations for winning and breaking course records for the men and women Tokyo Marathon. Well in Amos Kipruto for coming second. You are our heroes! Keep running," Ruto said. Kipchoge the double Olympic Champion won the race in 2hrs: 02min: 40sec while Brigid who is a World record holder completed the race in 2:16.02. Kipchoge ran the third-fastest marathon of his life—and the fourth-fastest of all time. Kipchoge holds the world record, 2:01:39, which he set in 2018 in Berlin, and he also ran 2:02:37 in 2019 in London. Amos Kipruto who pushed Kipchoge for almost 22 miles, ran a 17-second personal best and finished second in 2:03:13. Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia was third with 2:04:14.

This is the fourth fastest marathon ever ran by Kipchoge. "I am so proud to win in the streets of Tokyo, where the people have running in their heart and minds," he said.
