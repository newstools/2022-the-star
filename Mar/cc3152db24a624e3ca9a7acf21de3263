ODM leader Raila Odinga is at Machakos today for Azimio la Umoja rally with the Machakos residents. Raila landed at Machakos White House office grounds a little past noon on Saturday. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho and other Azimio la Umoja politicians were in attendance. The Machakos tour comes after Friday’s Bungoma rally. The Azimio la Umoja coalition, led by Raila Odinga has been touring across the country mobilizing voters for the August 9, General Polls. On Wednesday’s tour at Nakuru County, Raila said that the coalition will officially unveil its Presidential Candidate on March 12, at Jacaranda Grounds in Nairobi. Barely a week ago, President Uhuru Kenyatta endorsed the ODM leader for presidency saying that he has the best interests for the country.
