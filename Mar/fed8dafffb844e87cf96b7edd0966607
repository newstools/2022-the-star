At least one person died on Wednesday and three others are fighting for their lives in Uasin Gishu after consuming lethal illicit alcohol. Uasin Gishu county commissioner Stephen Kihara said the poisoning occurred at Kuinet village in Soy subcounty. He said the victim, who was in his late 30s, died on the way home after consuming the toxic drink. Kihara said the other three victims are in the 20s and 30s and are recovering at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “The three were in critical condition when they were rushed to the hospital," Kihara said. He said a sample of the liquor has sent to the government chemist to establish whether the four victims had consumed poisoned liquor Resident Shadrack Koech accused police of collecting bribes from distillers of the liquor instead of arresting them. He asked the government to swiftly transfer them out of the county. “Our youths are no longer productive as they are drinking illicit brew from morning to evening and the police post is just a few metres away from where the sale and consumption is taking place," Koech said. Koech, who was joined by Julius Kiprop, said whenever they report those involved in the illegal business, authorities tell them to go away . Police tell them civilians cannot tell them how to do their jobs, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
