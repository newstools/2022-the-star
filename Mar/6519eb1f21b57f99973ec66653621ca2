The mastermind of the despicable sexual harassment incident, that has attracted countrywide condemnation has finally been unmasked, DC boss George Kinot has said. According to Kinoti, undercover agents drawn from the elite Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) and DCI Nairobi Regional Headquarters, narrowed down on the suspect identified as Zachariah Nyaora Obadia. Using digital forensics, the sleuths working with cybercrime experts at the DCI National Forensic Laboratory, placed the thug at the scene of the crime scientifically. Attempts to put him in custody failed when they went after him on Tuesday afternoon deep in Mukuru Kaiyaba informal settlement. The suspect escaped DCI dragnet by a whisker, via a sewer duct. DCI says the suspect was positively identified by his wife and other relatives, sexually assaulting the victim in the widely shared videotape. Detectives say they are certain they will bring him to book soonest. The DCI boss cautioned the suspect from hiding further and ordered that he surrenders at DCI headquarters or the nearest Police station within 24 hours. Also, his accomplices who were within the vicinity of the barbaric attack whether captured on the video clip or not, have all been identified forensically. The group has been ordered to submit themselves at DCI headquarters before detectives catch up with them.
