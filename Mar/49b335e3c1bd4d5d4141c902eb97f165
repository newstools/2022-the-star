A senior chief who was abducted in August 2021 from a lodging in Lafey, Mandera County has been freed. The senior chief of Fino Mohamed Bulle who was abducted by unknown assailants suspected to be al-Shabaab on August 27, 2021, was released in Lamu, almost 700 kilometers away. He was released alongside his father in-law who was kidnapped two weeks after his abduction. Witnesses said they looked emaciated when they were found on March 2 by security officials in Lamu. They were flown to Nairobi for treatment and debriefing. “We don’t know why they were picked up from Mandera and abandoned in Lamu months later. We will know more,” a senior official aware of the incident said. The chief was abducted from a lodging in Lafey and the motive was not immediately known. Al-Shabaab militants often roam in the border area where they attack with impunity. In December 2020, a sub-chief was kidnapped and beheaded by suspected militants in Konton, Wajir county. His body was found days later by herders between Khorof Harar and Konton. Police have intensified operations near the 700 kilometers Somalia border from Lamu to Mandera. Dozens of security agents have been deployed. Militants have been staging attacks in the region, leaving many dead and destroying property. Police operations have been mounted to tackle the terror threat. The border region has borne the brunt of repeated attacks from the militants who are at times aided by locals. The area is near the Somalia border and the militants usually cross at will and stage attacks before escaping back. The insecurity has forced tens of non-local teachers to flee with non-Muslims often targeted in the attacks. At times, residents aid or do not report militants in their areas. Militants plant explosives along routes used by security forces and ambush them.
