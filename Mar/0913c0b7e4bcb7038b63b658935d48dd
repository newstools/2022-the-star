The trial of a son of Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai, who is accused of killing two people by dangerous driving, has been pushed to June 30. David Mwenda was to appear before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Nanzushi on Tuesday for the hearing. Mwenda has denied charges of causing death by dangerous driving and injuring a pedestrian. The hearing did not go on after the court was informed the magistrate was not sitting as she had gone for a training. The case was adjourned to June 30. The charge sheet says on December 2, 2021, at 6.42pm along the Southern ByPass near West Park Estate, Mwenda was driving a Toyota Hilux double cabin in a manner endangering other road users. Police said he swerved to the wrong side of the road and hit a motorcycle, causing the death of rider Stephen Musyoka. Mwenda is also accused of causing death of Richard Omwota on the same date and place. A pedestrian was seriously injured. Mwenda is out on cash bail of Sh300,000. The prosecution has lined up 13 witnesses. Police said the accident involved the car, a pedestrian, a motorcyclist and his pillion. Mwendwa is said to have told police he was driving on the bypass at a relatively high speed at about 6pm when he saw a motorcyclist make a u-turn ahead of him. As he swerved to avoid hitting the motorcyclist, his car hit a pedestrian who was crossing the road. The pedestrian was hospitalised with a broken rib. In the process, Mwenda lost control of the car which flew over a barrier and landed on the right side of the dual carriage road, hitting a motorcyclist and his pillion who died on the spot. The car was badly damaged and Mwendwa and at least two passengers on board were slightly injured. (Edited by V. Graham)
