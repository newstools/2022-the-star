A police officer is under investigation after a businessman he was escorting was shot and killed at a farm in Juja, Kiambu county. Sudhir Shah was among nine directors of Ndarugo Plantation 1960 who had visited the farm on Saturday. The directors had stopped at a site near Thika Highway at about 1pm when they were attacked. Shah was shot in the chest and died on the spot. A police bodyguard attached to son to former minister John Michuki was escorting the directors. He was armed with a pistol at the time of the incident. A team of detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations has taken over the probe. The directors and the police officer reported that they had finished their tour of the farm and had stopped at a site when two men armed with pistols attacked them. The gunmen were apparently on a motorcycle. The officer said he stepped back and fired at them eight times but he did not get his target. Police said the bodyguard claimed the gang had shot and killed the deceased before escaping. But the team that visited the scene said they had not recovered any spent cartridges from the said attackers. “The only spent cartridges they have found at the scene are those fired from the officer who was guarding the directors. This prompted the disarmament of the officer as part of the probe,” the investigator said. The weapon was taken for ballistic tests ahead of a planned autopsy on the body to establish if the killer bullets are different from those of the officer. Police said the motive of the attack is yet to be known. The team from homicide plans to revisit the scene with the directors and other witnesses for reconstruction and further investigations.
