Sugarcane farmers in Mapashi area of Transmara West, Narok County are counting loses running into millions of shillings after suspected arsonists set ablaze about 60 acres of cane plantation Saturday night. The arsonists reportedly struck at around 8pm, sparking a near fight between youths from two communities living in the area.  GSU officers from the nearby Transmara camp, however, managed to stave off full-fledged skirmishes. The fire occasioned losses estimated to be Sh50 million. The most affected farmers are from Mashapa area. The farmers' spokesman, Muntei ole Kilusu, said they suspect youth from the neighboring community for the constant arson attacks and want the government intervene. "We had been suffering loses for more than a year now, we want whoever is sending people to burn our farms to stop. We just want peace," the elder told journalists after a day-long security meeting on Sunday. Macarious Ole Momboshi, a youth, said the fire swept fast through the farms due to strong winds that were fanning the flames. Several other farms across the sub-county had been targeted by suspected arsonists in recent months causing losses to farm owners, Momboshi said. He blamed the incident on people he described as idlers who are up to no good. Momboshi said the constant infernos are dealing the community double tragedy because most of them have abandoned pastoralism for farming. "Most of us have since sold off cows to start farming. To make matters worse, factories have since passed laws to reject burnt cane," Momboshi told journalists. The farmers appealed to the government to conduct investigations into the fire incidents and arrest the suspects. “In all these incidents, we have not seen much of government action. We ask for intervention to end this madness," Momboshi said.
