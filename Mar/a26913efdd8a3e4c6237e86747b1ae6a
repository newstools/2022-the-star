Five national team stars were among 32 players named to the 3×3 side that will go into camp for the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. The five are Faheem Juma, Natalie Akinyi, Victoria Reynolds, Jemimah Knight and Melissa Otieno. However, Kenya Basketball Federation KBF first vice chairman, Hilmi Ali — while naming the provisional team during the trials at the University of Nairobi courts — said the door is not closed yet. “The first criteria we use for selecting the players is based on points. The second is FIBA eligibility,” said Ali. “We want to give all those who can make it a chance. We will ask them to join those who were available for selection this weekend.” Chef De Mission John Ogolla asked the players to keep working hard and be disciplined. Also named to the side are ex-internationals Hilda Indasi and Debra Obunga. The rest are Christine Omondi, Joy Mupalia, Mercy Mumio, Stella Kiberenge, Hilda Ndegwa and Medina Okot. The U-23 side consists of Lavender Opondo, Nicole Otieno, Winnie Chebet and Leah Wambasi. The men’s senior team has Davis Siaji, Darryl Omondi, Dominic Adero, Martin Buluma, David Odaga, William Mageto, Tobias Philip, faheem Juma, Frederick Onono and Larry Shavanga. The U23 side has Zule Brian, Timothy Oyoo, Ariel Ortega, Trevor Gari, Brian Tasut and Fred Maina.
