Three robbery with violence suspects fled after a shootout incident with police in Homabay County on Friday evening. The three are believed to be part of a gang that robbed customers at Ushirika bank, Kimilili, on Tuesday. The Kimilili incident left three injured as the robbers fled with Sh 25 million. They are also believed to be involved in another robbery mission within Homabay town on Friday, police said. According to a police report, there was a report that a black Premio Toyota vehicle had been spotted with four armed occupants. Homabay OCS Nelson Kinambuga dispatched his officers on a patrol to follow the car. Kinambuga said the officers laid an ambush for the vehicle at the Pier fish market gate, which the driver of the suspect vehicle ignored and sped off. "This prompted the officers to fire warning shots which deflated the right front and rear tyres," police said. Joseph Otieno Mirera, the driver, sustained a thigh injury on the right foot and the lower leg foot from the shooting and was rushed to Homabay County Referral Hospital. The 58 year old driver is reported to be in a stable condition. The scene has been processed and the motor vehicle has been towed to the station pending further investigation. "During the search conducted, a sharp panga was found in the boot among other personal belongings.” the report said. The case has since been transferred to the Homabay DCI.
