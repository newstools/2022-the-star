Frida Mtegoa, mother of the late Tanzanian actor Stephen Kanumba, has forgiven Elizabeth Michael, alias Lulu, for his murder. She was sentenced to a two-year sentence for accidentally killing Stephen Kanumba in 2017. She told the court that she acted in self-defence. In an interview with Global TV, Kanumba's mum said she had forgiven her and forgotten about it. "Wherever she is, let her know that I have nothing against her," she said. "I wish they had given me a grandchild at the time they were dating." Elizabeth was accused of pushing Kanumba violently, upon which he fell and received a fatal blow on his head. Lulu was released from prison and allowed to serve a community service sentence in 2018.
