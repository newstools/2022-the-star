Police in Rabai have seized narcotic drugs worth Sh1 million. Rabai sub county police commander Fredrick Abuga said police officers nabbed 16 sacks of bhang being transported in a 20 feet container at Kokotoni along the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. The drugs were seized after a tip off from the public. The police believe the drugs were being transported to Mombasa from a neighbouring country. The sacks had 9,460 big roles of bhang. “We have managed to arrest the driver and he has given us leads that will enable us arrest the people behind this haul of drugs. We believe the drugs are from a neighbouring country because the paper used to wrap them is from a company in a neighbouring country,” said Abuga. The SCPC police commander said the trailer managed to travel all the way because it appeared empty and it was hard to suspect anything. Abuga lauded the public for their cooperation and urged them to always volunteer information Many youths in the coast region have been affected by drug abuse. The police in the region are on high alert over increased drug abuse as the country heads to the general election. (Edited by Francis Wadegu)
