Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and the incumbent Cleophas Malala clashed over who between them is fit to be elected the next Kakamega governor. The two were among the leaders who attended the Kenya Kwanza rally led by Ford- Kenya party leader Moses Wetang’ula in Shinoyi market in Kakamega County on Friday. Dr Khalwale, who spoke first, said all the aspirants will be subjected to contest in the nominations for the seat and the best candidate will definitely win. He added that he is the one who has the capacity and upper hand to lead Kakamega as the next governor given his experience and popularity. “I want you to listen to me very well. The contest for the Kakamega governor’s position is not something to joke with. I’m the Bullfighter of this place and no one should cheat you that the existence of the unity between Musalia Mudavadi, Moses Wetang’ula and William Ruto will lead to the loss of democracy in the coalition,” he said. Khalwale said all aspirants from Unite Democratic Alliance, Amani National Congress and Ford-Kenya will have to go for nominations and allow the best candidate to carry the flag under the Kenya Kwanza alliance. In response, Senator Malala dismissed Khalwale’s sentiments, saying that there should be a consensus between them in order to have one of them go for the governor position and the other for the senatorial slot. “Let me tell you Dr Khalwale, I have a lot of respect for you, you are my political father and if we do not plan and agree between the two of us, we shall both lose. “You (Khalwale) should not always chest-thumb saying, I’m a Bullfighter, I’m a Bullfighter, you will terribly lose again. Relax, if Ruto and Musalia agreed and are working together, why not you and me?" Malala posed.
