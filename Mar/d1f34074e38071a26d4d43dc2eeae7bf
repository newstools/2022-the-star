Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka is in Kampala, Uganda for talks on the peace process in South Sudan. Kalonzo who has been part of the peace process for the past two years met with the former Ugandan Special Envoy to South Sudan Betty Bigombe and British High Commissioner to Uganda Kate Airey at the Serena Hotel, Kampala. "We reached a consensus that for the peace process to unclog, there needs to be more input from all IGAD Heads of State,"Kalonzo said. The talks generally focussed on the status of the security regime of the Revitalised -Agreement on the Resolutions of the Conflict in South Sudan and in particular the unification of the two armies. “My consultations with the two envoys focused on the planned retreat in Uganda and which has now been postponed indefinitely," Kalonzo said. He said President Yoweri Museveni was supposed to convene the high-Level retreat bringing together President Salva Kiir and first Vice President Dr. Riak Machar "This will lead to faster realization of the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolutions of the Conflict in South Sudan & in particular, unify the two armies for peace," he said. Uganda which is one of the guarantors in the tripartite agreement between South Sudan, Uganda and Sudan has taken a lead role in hosting meetings aimed at bringing sustainable peace to South Sudan. “We have reached a consensus that President Uhuru Kenyatta working closely with President Museveni needs to play a more proactive role including the need to revitalise IGAD itself," he said. The former VP is a well-known peace mediator with wide-ranging experience in peace talks. The most recent time he was in Uganda over the South Sudan peace talks was in December, 2021.
