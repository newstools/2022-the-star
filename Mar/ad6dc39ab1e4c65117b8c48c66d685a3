The Ministry of Education will blacklist all contractors who fail to complete Competency Based Curriculum classrooms by Friday, Education Principal Secretary Julius Jwan has said. Jwan said the contractors have until March 11,  to complete the secondary school CBC classrooms. He said government had given the contractors adequate time to do the works and even extended the deadline. “The government will blacklist the companies because they are not honest. We want to prevent them from getting any government tender in the future,” he said. Construction of the classrooms began in November last year and government wanted them completed by March. The deadline was set for March 7 but it was later extended to March 11. On Saturday after touring construction of the CBC classrooms at Ngere Mixed Secondary School in Homa Bay, Jwan said the construction should be complete before students begin their KCSE exams. “All constructions will stop on March 11. Incomplete works will be terminated and companies blacklisted because they fail to comply with the agreement,” Jwan said. He was accompanied by Homa Bay Deputy county commissioner Jude Wasonga and county Director of education Eunice Khaemba. The government has set aside Sh3.2 billion to pay the contractors. The PS said Homa Bay was lagging behind with works at 88 per cent completions. He expressed concerns that many contractors working in schools in Mfangano Island in Suba North constituency had completed their work yet some schools in the mainland are yet to be completed. Jwan said schools like Ogande Mixed,  Ambassador Pamela Mboya Girls and Prof Karega Mutahi are some of the schools that have completed the construction. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
