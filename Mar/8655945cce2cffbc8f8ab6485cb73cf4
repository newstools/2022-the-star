Speaking to the Star, Mutyambai added that five motorcycles have also been seized over the assault case. The incident happened on the Wangari Maathai road on Friday. Mutyambai added that the operation to get more suspects is ongoing and urged members of the public and other players for cooperation. “It will not be business as usual. We will hunt all those behind this and others,” he said. Earlier on, CS Fred Matiangi had condemned the incident and called for immediate arrest of those involved. Matiang'i termed the incident as disgusting even as he expressed his commitment to bringing to book those involved. "I am shocked and disgusted by a viral video clip of a female motorist being molested by suspected bodaboda riders along Wangari Maathai /Forest Road," he said. Matiangi said the government must protect the road users from such vile and reprehensible acts of aggression. "I have asked our security agents to ensure that all the perpetrators of this dastardly act are swiftly apprehended and suitably punished for their heinous act," he said. Energy CS Monica Juma also weighed in on the matter describing it as 'Outrageous - not acceptable'. "All those involved must face the full force of the law. What a shame that no one could help/protect this young woman from this criminal attack in broad daylight?" she posed. "How did our society come to lose all humanity? Really?" The incident occurred on Friday, March 4, but the matter came to the limelight on Monday, March 7, 2022, after the video was widely circulated on social media. Edited by B. Marita
