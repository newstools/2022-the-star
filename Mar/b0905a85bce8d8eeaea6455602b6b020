ODM leader Raila Odinga has denied settling on the Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth as his running mate in the August 9, presidential poll. Speaking at a press conference where he was welcoming a group of Murang'a MCAs to Azimio La Umoja on Monday, the ODM leader said the matter is yet to be discussed. He went further and revealed that Kenneth is yet to even request the post. The Opposition chief said the Azimio La Umoja coalition is focused on building a movement and the matter of a running mate is yet to be deliberated on. "Peter Kenneth has not even asked to be a running mate. So we are yet to start talking about who will be a running mate. We are creating a movement. We will discuss the issues when the time comes," Raila said. Kenneth, who was present at the press conference, appeared to confirm the ODM leader's remarks. The former MP said they are backing the ODM leader unconditionally because they believe he is the best to lead the country. He maintained that their heart is with Raila because they feel safe with him. "We are supporting the fifth without any conditions because we believe we are safe under Raila. Not just as a community but as a country as a whole," Kenneth said. The remarks come at a time when Kenneth is being billed as Raila's most likely running mate in the August 9, polls. Opinion polls have ranked Kenneth ahead of the rest who have the potential of being Raila's deputy.
