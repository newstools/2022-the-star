There were pockets of violence at Mapishi area in Transmara West, Narok County on Monday morning following the torching of sugarcane farms on Sunday night. Youths from the Maasai and Kisii communities engaged each other in a confrontation that did not take long to be contained. Police were forced to lob teargas to separate them from engaging in further acts of violence. There were no cases of fatalities reported, security officials told journalists. Commissioners Allan Macharia (Kisii) and Isaac Masinde (Narok) warned that the government would not hesitate to take action on those sparking tension along the volatile border. "We would intensify security patrols along the border area to ensure law and order. We would not get lax until the situation remains calm," Macharia said. Masinde on his side told the elders from both sides to reign in on their youth to stem further incursions over cane arson. Elders, he said, have a role to ensure youth maintain long-lasting peace adding that both communities should forge unity and cohesion. Keiyian MCA Mark Mukut asked the government to end the madness of burning sugarcane farms. He said farmers incur huge losses in the wake of such incidents. At least 70 acres of sugarcane farms were torched on Sunday. The burnt sugarcane plantations have an estimated worth of Sh50 million.
