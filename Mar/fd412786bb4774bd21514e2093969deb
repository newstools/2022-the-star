The government has deployed choppers to deliver KCPE papers to far-flung centres along the Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia borders. Northeastern regional commissioner James Kianda said the papers are being delivered to Hulugho, Galmagala, Liboi, Kulan in Garissa, eastern parts of Habaswein in Wajir and Arabia and Takaba in Mandera. Kianda spoke on Tuesday after opening the examination container at the Garissa county commissioner’s compound. The commissioner said the choppers were deployed by KNEC in liaison with Interior and Education ministries. The decision was made due to sustained terror attacks in the region by the Somalia-based al Shabaab. On Monday last week, an Omar Jillow chief was attacked by suspected al Shabaab while coming back from Arabia, Mandera. He was reportedly accosted by the militants who butchered him before fleeing back to Somalia on foot. The attacks have caused anxiety among residents with fears that the militants might target to disrupt the exams. Kianda has however said that the residents have no cause to worry as proper security measures have been put in place. He said state agencies are working together to ensure the exam goes on smoothly. The commissioner said security officers including KDF and border patrol units are also involved in securing examination centres that are close to the border. “Every security officer in the region is directly or indirectly involved in this process,” he said. Kianda later toured Garissa Primary School to assess the examination process. The students will take their Science, Kiswahili and Insha exams on Tuesday while Social Studies will be done on Wednesday. A total of 12,189 boys and 8,839 girls are sitting for their KCPE in 582 centres in Northeastern. Additionally, there are 1,834 boys and 1,207 girls from refugee camps sitting for the examinations. More than 1.2 million candidates are sitting for this year’s KCPE exams across the country. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
