Tanzanian singer Darassa did not make money from his breakthrough hit song 'Muziki' in 2016. In 2017, the musician rocked the airwaves with 'Too Much' but took a break thereafter. Speaking on Bonga Na Jalas, Darassa said promoters took advantage of him and his talent. He ended up not making any money from his music. "I needed a break to focus on music as a business and not just a street artiste," he said. "Many people thought my music was a one-time thing. Some people wanted to take advantage of my talent. The industry did not want to receive my work seriously and there was enmity from within the industry." He added that he was not aware of the legal requirements when getting into music deals. "Promoters sold my music without my knowledge. Even to date, I have not earned from the Skiza tune of that song since 2016. I have since learnt that direction is better than speed." Asked if he was afraid of how his next music would be received after 'Muziki' featuring Ben Pol, Darassa said he did not want to be famous and broke at the same time. "I was afraid since that song went viral but I did not have anything in my pocket. I did not want to disappoint my fans." During the break, rumours went viral that the Bongo star was hooked to hard drugs and could not record new music or come out in the public. He is in Nairobi to work with different Kenyan artistes.
