Hit Squad assistant coach Dave Munuhe says he is impressed with the rising number of Kenyan youths taking up boxing as a sport. Munuhe, who doubles up as the Kenya Police Boxing Club head coach, says the steady rise has played a key role in enhancing local standards. “We usually train at the Mathare Depot and I'm amazed by the huge turnout. That's how we spot talent. Many Kenyan youths seem to be interested in developing skills in boxing,” said Munuhe. “Many boxers competing for the few available slots only means that competition is increasing which, of course, is good for the growth of the sport,” said Munuhe. The seasoned tactician has consequently tipped Kenya's fortunes to improve on the global front as more talents continue to unearth. Munuhe said the intense competition witnessed during the Kenya Novices Boxing Championship in Nairobi last month attests to this fact. Munuhe extolled his charges for rising to the occasion at the tournament and urged them to battle tooth and nail to defend their forte at the forthcoming National Intermediate Boxing Championship slated for Thika from March 17-19. “We'll undoubtedly enter boxers in the tournament and we expect another good performance from the budding boxers,” said Munuhe, who is keen to find the right people to fit into the shoes of seasoned boxers like Elly Ajowi, who has since expressed a desire to retire. The Africa Zone 3 superheavyweight champion indicated he plans to call time on his career at the end of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. “I intend to retire immediately after the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games in July. I believe I have already achieved quite a lot and it's a high time I created some room in the ring for budding boxers,” he said.
