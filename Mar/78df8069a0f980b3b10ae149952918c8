Wiper leader  Kalonzo Musyoka has made attempts to reach out to ODM leader Raila Odinga in a bid to have the agreement they signed in 2017 effected in vain. This was revealed during a press conference on Tuesday at his command centre in Karen. Kalonzo's personal statement came with a demand that the ODM leader honours the deal by backing him for the presidency. Critics however say Kalonzo was upping his chances for negotiation with the ODM leader Raila Odinga.
