Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka now says he has no option but to work with the ODM leader Raila Odinga. The former vice president says the willingness of his party and the One Kenya Alliance at large to partner with Azimio la Umoja ahead of the August polls has boxed him in a situation that he won't evade working with Raila. "After deep consultations with my own party and the One Kenya Alliance, we have said we are ready to work within a grand coalition of Azimio and OKA. The party leader of Jubilee has come out to pronounce on that formation. That is a bigger consideration. Within that bigger framework, we have no option but to work with Raila Odinga," Kalonzo told NTV on Tuesday evening. According to Kalonzo, whether the ODM leader reneges on their 2017 pact with him or not, they will still have to work together. He, however, noted that his failure to heed the pact will only bring more trust issues. "If Raila refuses to adhere to the document he will be compounding the trust deficit that brought about the collapse of NASA," he noted The twist comes hours after the Wiper leader addressed a press conference and ostensibly said he will only work with Raila if he honours the 2017 pact. The 2017 pact, signed by the two leaders, was to see Kalonzo back Raila in the 2017 polls and the latter will return the favour in the 2022 elections. Kalonzo's latest remark is a ray of hope to the ODM leader who political pundits say his success in the August polls is pegged on Kalonzo's political direction.
