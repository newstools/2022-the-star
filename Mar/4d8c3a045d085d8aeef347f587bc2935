Nairobi City Stars legend John Amboko has attributed the club’s improved performance in the Kenyan Premier League to support from the management, team chemistry and the leadership skills of head coach Nicholas Muyoti. His sentiments come at a time when Simba wa Nairobi are second on the 18-team log with 35 points, five off the top spot, after 19 rounds. “I can say that this season is one of the best so far, based on our performance. The team is well motivated due to the support we are receiving from sponsors and the management,” said Amboko. The former stopper and captain added: “The chemistry among the players is evident as they have played together for long. Under the leadership of our head coach (Nicholas Muyoti), the entire technical bench is working very hard and approaching each game with the seriousness it deserves.” Save for 2013 when he turned out for AFC Leopards, Amboko has been in Nairobi City Stars' books as a player from when the club was known as World Hope — 2003 to 2017. He turned to coaching upon retirement and has been part of the clubs’ journey out of the topflight and back up in 2020. He is currently the club’s assistant coach. Amboko recently upgraded his coaching badge from CAF ‘C’ to CAF ‘B’ License. At the same time, youngster Rowland Makati has promised to stay focused despite missing out on KPL action. “The season is going on very well for the team. Everyone is at their best and the competition for positions is really stiff. I am not about to lose focus because of the competition. I am focused and I know that my time (to play) will come. And when that day comes, I will not let go, it will be hard to bump me off the team,” he said. Makati, on a long-term contract with City Stars, spent the entire 2020/21 season on loan at the now-defunct National Super League side Nairobi Stima.
