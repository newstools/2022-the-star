One of the Ndichu brothers was on Wednesday charged with assault and malicious damage. Paul Mwaura Ndichu was charged before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa. He denied the charges. He was released on Sh100,000 bond with cash bail of the same amount. His brother Edward failed to take a plea on grounds his employer refused to give him time off to attend court. Prior to Wednesday's court session, Kibera chief magistrate Ann Mwangi was informed the two brothers were unable to take a plea in  previous sessions because they were in the United States, outside Kenya’s jurisdiction. As a result, the court directed the matter be mentioned Wednesday and directed them to appear for plea taking. Only Paul showed up. The charge sheet that was read in court said that Paul Ndichu and Edward Ndichu destroyed motor vehicle side mirrors valued at Sh87,000, property belonging to Samuel Dennis Ramdas. Paul Mwaura Ndichu, the court heard on Wednesday, assaulted Cheryl Murgor , causing her bodily harm at the Emara Ole Sereni Hotel in Lang’ata within Nairobi. He is also alleged to have assaulted Patrick Koech on the same date, time and place. The charge sheet further said he assaulted Stephanie Murgor and Chelimo Murgor. Edward Wanyoike Ndichu is said to have assaulted Samuel Ramdas on the same date, place and time at the same hotel. (Edited by V. Graham)
