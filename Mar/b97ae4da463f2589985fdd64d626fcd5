The case in which several lobby groups have challenged the political parties (amendment) Act 2021 will now be heard by a three-judge bench. Justice Hedwig Ong’udi said she has looked at the case and is of the view that it should be heard by a bench. “This court has on its own motion certified this matter as one requiring empanelment of a bench,” the judge said. Ong’udi said that her reasons for forwarding the matter to Chief Justice Martha Koome will be included in the file that will be forwarded to her. Meanwhile, the court has also allowed Azimio La Umoja to be enjoined in the matter as interested parties. The case will be mentioned on March 24. In January, President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the controversial Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021, setting the stage for the formation of mega coalitions ahead of the polls. The Bill, 2021, was passed in the Senate after the Handshake team trounced deputy president William Ruto's allies in voting for the Bill. The new law amends the Political Parties Act of 2011 by introducing the concept of coalition political parties, outlining functions of political parties as well as changing the criteria of accessing the Political Parties Fund. The law also empowers the Registrar of Political Parties to certify political party membership lists and nomination rules among other transformative provisions aimed at strengthening management of political parties and enhancing democracy.
