Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has announced that he would defend his seat through the UDA ticket. The MP posted a receipt of the payment he had made as stipulated by the UDA National Elections Board (NEB). “I have officially left my former party Jubilee and joined the party of the future, UDA,” Gachagua wrote on his Facebook page. The MP also called upon his competitors to join the party before Friday’s deadline so that they can get a chance of facing him in the party nominations. He said he would not join Azimio Coalition but will stick with Deputy President William Ruto's party. This comes a day after Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter joined the party, where he was welcomed by Gachagua. Recently, Gachagua caused an uproar after he said Ruto's running mate will come from the Mt Kenya region. In an interview on Monday with Citizen TV, Gachagua further said that Musalia Mudavadi was subject to discussion and that the ANC leader together with the other Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders were aware that the running mate will be from Mt Kenya. “We don’t want to con someone. They will not be running mates,” he added. Reacting to Gachagua’s remarks, Makueni MP Daniel Maanzo on Tuesday said that he expects UDA to name the Mathira MP as Ruto’s Deputy, bearing in mind his support to the Party. Maanzo also said that if the DP did not name Gachagua as his running mate, then Kenya Kwanza Alliance will be as good as dead. “Azimio la Umoja, One Kenya Alliance and UDA or Kenya Kwanza, the running mate will still come from Central Kenya and if William Ruto’s mate is not Rigathi, then that is the end of that Coalition,” Maanzo told KTN News. Rigathi Gachagua said the UDA Party will unveil William Ruto as their Presidential Candidate on March 15.
