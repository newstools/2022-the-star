Contractors of  Competency Based Curriculum classrooms won’t be paid if they don't deliver quality work, Bungoma county commissioner Samuel Kimiti has said. Kimiti said the Ministry of Education has invested heavily in the project as preparation for 100 per cent transition of learners under the new curriculum picks pace. “The government needs value for money through provision of quality structures and those who deliver mediocre projects will not be paid,” Kimiti said. Kimiti spoke on Wednesday during the commissioning of three CBC classrooms at Lwanda Boys, Lwanda Girls and Litungu Secondary School in Kanduyi constituency. He said that the old curriculum had a lot of gaps - where learning was based on excelling in exams and joining universities yet the pupils lacked basic skills. “Initially we could teach students based on how they have grasped theories but at the end they get no jobs," Kimiti said. "This new curriculum make students more practical and nurture their talents to help them survive in the job market." Bungoma was recently cited as one of counties with a high number of unfinished CBC projects with only 30 completed classrooms out of the expected 316. “Bungoma has only 30 classrooms completed which is a low number and we are trying to beat the April deadline given by the ministry,”Kimiti said. Kimiti was commissioning the projects on behalf of Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
