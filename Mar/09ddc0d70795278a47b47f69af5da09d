Comedian Churchill has confirmed that his show has moved from NTV. The comedy show will be launched on March 19 at Mount Kenya University inside the Mwai Kibaki Convention Centre, Thika. On Instagram, Churchill expressed how eager and excited he is to be back on stage with new big acts and a whole new experience as he brings back the much-anticipated show. The show will now be airing on TV 47. "We have a new home," he captioned a video on his social media platforms. Production costs and logistics are some of the reasons that Laugh Industries terminated its partnership with NTV. Leonard Kitili will take over as director of the comedy show following the departure of acclaimed music producer and cinematographer J Blessing.
