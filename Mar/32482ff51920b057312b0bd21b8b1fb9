Lawyer Ndegwa Njiru has accused Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka of being indecisive and unreliable. In an interview on K24 TV on Thursday, Njiru said that Kalonzo’s political might in the Ukambani region had declined while Governors Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui) popularity continued to rise. According to Ndegwa Njiru, Kalonzo has not invested in Azimio la Umoja but had sought to be supported for the Presidency, which to him was ironical. “We cannot keep on speaking about the agreement. We must look at the political validity of it,” said Njiru. Njiru reminded Kalonzo of how Raila had himself sworn in as the “people’s president” in 2018 in the presence of thousands of supporters in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, an event that the Wiper leader failed to attend. According to Ndegwa Njiru, taking the oath made Raila relevant in the sense that the swearing-in led to the 2018 handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. “The swearing-in of Baba ushered a new era in Kenyan politics. We can only recognize Kalonzo if he has equally invested in Azimio la Umoja,” said Njiru. Kalonzo Tuesday publicly accused Raila of betrayal and flashed out a 2017 secret agreement that bars the ODM leader from running for president. However, some critics said Kalonzo was only upping the stakes in his negotiations with Raila.
