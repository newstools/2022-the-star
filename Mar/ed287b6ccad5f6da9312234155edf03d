Last week Kenya courageously voted in the UN Security Council to condemn the invasion of Ukraine by President Putin. Africa knows that all borders are to some extent arbitrary, established by force or compromise in the past. If those borders are not accepted, the world can unravel. Which is why the Africa Union recognises existing borders, even though they were mostly defined in the Berlin conference of 1884. Unfortunately President Putin allowed himself to be seduced by the theory that the peoples of the Ukraine and Russia are one and the same, that their shared history outweighs any present differences. He expected to be welcomed with open arms when the Russian army entered Ukraine to instal a friendly regime. Instead, Ukrainians fought fiercely to block the invaders. Now Ukraine has indicated that it would be willing to accept a ceasefire. Ukraine cannot defeat the much larger Russian army but Russia cannot win either and faces a long drawn-out guerilla war if it stays in the Ukraine. President Putin should accept a ceasefire and a negotiated solution, perhaps based on the promise that Ukraine will not join NATO. Quote of the day: "Fascism is fascism. Terrorism is terrorism.
