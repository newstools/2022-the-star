The 2022 Barthes U20 Trophy will be held in Nairobi from April 9 to 17. This was confirmed by Kenya Rugby Union Chairman Oduor Gangla during the official launch of the Rugby Africa 2022 competition calendar in Kampala, Uganda. Gangla said: “This year, we have eight teams coming for the event including Madagascar, Senegal, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Namibia, Zambia and Kenya.” “This is a major step forward for U20 rugby in Africa and as the Kenya Rugby Union, we are honored and humbled to have the opportunity to host this event. It is the first time we are hosting a unified competition for this age group,” he added. "Preparations are going on and we are looking forward to a very competitive event where the young players come out and showcase their talent and ability." "I must appreciate the Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Sports, led by Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed as well as the Local Organising Committee for their hard work towards delivering this event," added Gangla. "This year’s event will be played in front of spectators and we look forward to hosting a memorable event in Nairobi.” The Barthés U20 Trophy is the Rugby Africa U20 championship. Teams compete on an annual basis and the winners of the competition earn the right to represent the continent at the World Rugby Junior Trophy. Kenya are the current champions, having first won it in 2019 with a 21-18 win over Namibia at the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka, Nairobi before defeating Madagascar 21-20 in last year’s decider at the Nyayo Stadium, Nairobi.
