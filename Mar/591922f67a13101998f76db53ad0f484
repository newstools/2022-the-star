Carrol Muthoni, the ex-girlfriend of comedian Mulamwah, says lack of trust was the reason they broke up. In an interview on Radio Jambo, Muthoni, who no longer goes by the nickname Sonie, said they both agreed to part ways as the relationship was not working. "We had our own differences, which kept dragging us behind," she said. "There was no trust from both sides. We are the only ones responsible for the truth. We have both not accepted to move on." Muthoni asked her baby daddy to respect their differences for the sake of their child, Keilah. Muthoni and Mulamwah announced their break-up in September last year. She said the continuous attacks by her baby daddy have affected her as a new mum. "I was so affected that I could not breastfeed. Milk was not being expressed because of stress," she said, adding that her mum supported her. "There are people who were looking up to us and feel like we have disappointed. But it is best that one leaves, do not stay in a relationship where you are not happy or comfortable doing something." Comedian Mulamwah had said the reason his relationship with Carrol Muthoni ended was she had high financial expectations. He said Muthoni wanted him to spend on things that did not make sense to him. Responding to that, Muthoni said she has never depended on him. "I live with my mum and I would want to work hard and not depend on any man. I never asked him for any money to cater for my bills. He should say the truth, people can see and Kenyans are very smart." Asked if he visits their child, Muthoni said he last saw her when she was two months old. Keilah is five months. "He had not paid any dowry for me. They accepted him into the family, but they are cool. We were in a relationship for three years," she said.
