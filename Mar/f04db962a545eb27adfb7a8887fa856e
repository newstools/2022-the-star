Ulinzi Starlets coach Joseph Mwanza is worried about the threat posed by Zetech Sparks ahead of their Kenya Women's Premier League match this weekend. Mwanza admitted that Sparks are a technical team and his charges will have to be on the lookout to avoid dropping more points after their 1-1  draw with Gaspo in their last encounter. Three points are a priority for Ulinzi as they seek to return to winning ways. Ulinzi also play Kisumu All-Starlets and Kayole before the end of the first leg. "Honestly, Sparks are a good team technically. They play really well but have had unfortunate results hence their current position on the log doesn't really portray their strength." "We need to step on the gas pedal. There's the possibility of taking nine points starting with Sparks in order to build momentum going forward." He continued: "I have huge respect for Zetech because our matches against them are always hard. We have played a lot of friendlies and we are undefeated in the last three meetings against Zetech but they are no pushovers." The soldiers beat the Bernard Kitolo-coached Sparks 2-1 in the first leg last season while the reverse fixture witnessed a goalless draw. Ulinzi, captained by Diana Shakava, managed a 3-2 win in the Football Kenya Federation Women's Cup. Regarding the situation in the camp, Mwanza said: "Morale is high and the girls are training normally. We want to have the best preparations for the match." "We have a few knocks but we still have three days to assess the players before deciding on who is available  or not."
