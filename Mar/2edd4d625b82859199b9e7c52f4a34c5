Belarusian tennis player and former world number one Victoria Azarenka has said she is"devastated" by the situation in Ukraine and called for "peace and an end to the war". "It is heart-breaking to see how many innocent people have been affected and continue to be affected by such violence," she tweeted. She added she had always witnessed both nations of Ukraine and Belarus, along with their citizens, being "friendly and supportive" of one another. "It is hard to witness the violent separation that is currently taking place instead of supporting and finding compassion for each other." Belarus, located directly north of Ukraine, is a staunch ally of Russia and has acted as a key staging area for Russian forces to launch attacks on Ukraine's northern cities. Athletes from both Russia and Belarus have been barred from competing in international athletic competitions as a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
