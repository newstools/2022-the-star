A building under construction has collapsed in Kinoo area in Nairobi county. In the pictures seen by the Star, the building collapsed and leaned on another finished building on Sunday. Officials were seen in the area as they tried to determine the extent of the damage. According to the billboard on the site, the approval of the building was done by Nairobi county government. Residents said they were surprised when they heard earth-tremor-like sound. "I was driving home and my wife called me saying there was a building that had collapsed. So I rushed home and at least there was no casualties," a resident said. According to the tenants in adjacent buildings, the five-storey building caved in at about 11.30 pm. At the time building disintegrated, nobody was in the building. Six months ago, a five-storey residential building under construction collapsed in Kinoo. According to the residents, trouble started when the caretaker noticed cracks and alerted the owner. Quantity surveyors urged developers to work with certified professionals to prevent buildings from collapsing. The Institute of Quantity Surveyors of Kenya said the leaning five-story building in Kinoo in Kiambu and the collapse in Gachie could have been avoided with strict compliance. Professionals are asked to carry out their duties diligently and in a manner that is not negligent, they said.
