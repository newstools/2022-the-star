The tax row between Kenya Revenue Authority and Keroche Industries which has led to the closure of the brewery over tax arrears has attracted political dissent. Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua on Wednesday questioned why the taxman is adamant on his refusal to grant the troubled firm a grace period to enable it clear the tax owed. “In the Keroche issue, all they are asking for is more time not a waiver, yet we recall KRA in unclear circumstances waived taxes for a financially performing entity during the process of merger, why this discrimination and hostility against Keroche,” Karua said in a tweet on Wednesday. KRA shut down the Naivasha-based Keroche Breweries on March, 4 over Sh332 million tax arrears. The Taxman said the firm had defaulted on all its promises to clear the tax which had accrued since January 2021. Following the closure of Keroche Breweries, Chief Executive Officer Tabitha Karanja sent a passionate appeal for President Uhuru Kenyatta´s intervention to save the company from collapse and loss of jobs.
