Chama Cha Kazi Party leader Moses Kuria has said they are in talks with Kenya Kwanza Alliance. On his Facebook page, Kuria said his party and 21 other political parties are in early talks with the Alliance that will lead to a very broad-based grand coalition. "...That will deliver the nation to peace and prosperity," he said. The Gatundu South MP has maintained that the Azimio la Umoja camp is not an option for him as the country heads to the August 9 polls. Kuria said he will always be on the winning side. Kuria has been unpredictable in his 2022 coalition formation. Last month, the Gatundu South MP scheduled its National Delegates Conference on March 15. The move raised eyebrows considering Deputy President William Ruto is set to have his NDC on the same date. A notice by CCK party secretary-general Kimani Nage stated that the NDC will be held at the Bomas of Kenya. The agenda of the meeting includes reviewing, formulation and approval of the Chama Cha Kazi policies and consideration and approval of any other party matters. The DP's NDC will be held at Kasarani Indoor arena on the same day. The move to schedule the NDC the same day as that of UDA has generated a lot of buzz with Kenyans on social media expressing mixed reactions. A section of Kenyans thought the move was to enable Kuria to have an excuse why he will not attend Ruto's meeting. Others questioned whether he will be joining Ruto's camp on the same day.
