Women in Trans-Nzoia County celebrated this year's International Women's Day in an event that was punctuated with calls to the government to protect women seeking elective positions in the country. The women group on Tuesday said it is uncalled for to see male politicians intimidating and harassing female aspirants. Led by Women Rep Janet Nangabo, they asked the government to provide a level playing ground to all aspirants, a move that would make more women join politics. "We want the government to protect all women aspiring for various political positions. It is sad seeing male chauvinists plotting to intimidate and harass female competitors," Nangabo said at Sabaoti grounds. For fair competition, the women leaders appealed for protection from their male counterparts who are out to frustrate their bid for leadership. Nangabo asked Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutiambayi to assure all women aspirants of maximum security. " IG Mutiambayi should assure all women aspirants of maximum security before, during and after the August 9, elections. In the past, we have seen situations where women are intimidated and harassed," Nangabo noted. The county MP encouraged women to come out in large numbers and fight for their rightful political space in society. "We should not fear men. Let us face them. We must exercise our constitutional rights and take part in the elections to demonstrate our leadership qualities," she said. At the same time, the women leaders also urged for a probe on politicians alleged to be involved in sponsoring criminal gangs in slum areas within the county. They said it was shameful for politicians to engage the unemployed youths in crime for their own political reasons.
