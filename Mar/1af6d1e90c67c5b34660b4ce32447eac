Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has urged fellow leaders to unite Kenyans and preach peace ahead of the August general election. Osotsi said in the past there was a failure to manage the transition after every election leading to violence. The lawmaker said Kenya has had a bad experience in2007, 2013 and 2017 presidential elections, which has led to loss of lives. “In this election, we must write a new history globally by having a peaceful transition after August,” Osotsi said on Monday. “With a smooth transition of power in our country, election violence can be prevented.” He said supporters should maintain peace, love and unity across the board. He said Kenya belongs to everyone and no one should feel superior, no matter the status quo. “Whenever we lead the nation into an internal crisis, we destroy what we have achieved for the last five years which is not good for a country that is still under third world countries,” Osotsi said. “I urge my fellow politicians, despite our political affiliations, to always unite Kenyans.” The lawmaker said Azimio la Umoja is already on the course of uniting Kenyans and bringing them together despite their political parties.
