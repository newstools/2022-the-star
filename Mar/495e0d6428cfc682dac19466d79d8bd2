Policy holders of the collapsed Standard Assurance Company Ltd currently in liquidation are to be paid by the Policyholders Compensation Fund (PCF). The maximum compensation payable to the 690 claimants on any single claim lois Sh250,000. The total payout is Sh172.5 million. This is the second time that the Fund is making such a payment and comes eight months after its first payout to policyholders of companies under statutory management. Standard Assurance Company was placed under statutory management on March 11, 2009 after running into serious operational and financial difficulties making it unable to meet its obligations as an insurer. “The decision to establish the Fund was a key initiative in the reform of the insurance sector. Its primary purpose is to protect policyholders of insolvent insurance companies by compensating them,” William Masita, PCF managing trustee said. The company was unable to settle Sh 100 million in outstanding claims owed to policyholders and creditors as well as payment of levies as prescribed in the Insurance Act. Access Insurance, Kenya National Assurance Company, Stallion, Lakestar, Liberty Assurance Limited and United Insurance are among the insurance companies among the 49 registered that have collapsed in similar circumstances. Masita said that the Fund is compensating claimants for companies declared insolvent and whose liquidation process has been cleared by the courts. He said PCF has put in place an elaborate framework to ensure the successful implementation of the Compensation of Standard Assurance policyholder claims. Claimants should fill the necessary forms with supporting documents and submit the same to PCF for verification and payment. The fully completed claim compensation form should be supported by evidence of an existence of a claim with the company (claim form), evidence of quantum of the claim (Discharge Voucher or a Decree/Court Award in case of Third Part Claimants).
