Series leader Karan Patel will be looking to conquer Nakuru Rally terrain as action heads to the Mogotio area on Saturday. The event will start and finish at the Mogotio Cultural Centre in the Equator zone. The event to be sponsored by Kenya Breweries Limited through its flagship Whitecap brand will feature a total competitive mileage of 158.00kms and a transport road section of 86.86km. Karan, one of the fastest drivers in the Kenya National Rally Championship currently, will team up with Tauseef Khan in a Ford Fiesta Rally 2 car. Another Rally 2 (formally R5) driver entered for the event is Aakif Virani who is making a comeback after a three months hiatus. Aakif is the reigning KNRC Division One champion and Kenya Motor Sports Personality-of-the-Year. The Nairobi-based driver skipped the season opener due to personal commitments and is making his comeback after December’s season-closing Guru Nanak Rally which took place in Il-Bisil. Aakif noted that his approach on comeback will be the same as last year, meaning remaining tactical when it’s rough and aggressive where conditions allow”. “Well, we have not sat in the car since December and our New electronic unit was delayed at the airport, so hopefully we will get a try in the car prior to the rally. My expectations this year are the same as last year... No major expectations, as such, just to enjoy and drive each event sensibly,” said Aakif who will be piloting an ex-Manvir Baryan Skoda Fanbia.
