Chaos erupted at the Jubilee's Nakuru party headquarters after aspirants disagreed on the removal of one party official. The disgruntled aspirants had called for a meeting with the officials after they were left out of the registration exercise because of their names missing in the party register. The meeting turned into a fistfight after the former Nakuru Jubilee chairman David Manyara accused the Regional Director Peter Cheruiyot of being the weak link in the party. David Manyara who is also an aspirant for the Nakuru East Member of parliament seat threw salvos at the Regional Director and the party chairman James Karimi for mismanaging the party. “We have a problem here and am telling you we must meet and talk, we have even called the Secretary-General Jeremiah Kioni to solve this problem,” Manyara said. Manyara insisted that the Nakuru office must have the right number of 19 officials before the nominations are held to make sure they are free and fair. “The regional director Peter Cheruiyot is not an official. All officials were sacked and we now have new officials led by SG Jeremiah Kioni therefore he is not a director,” Manyara said. This however irked some aspirants who accused Manyara of diverting from the main agenda of the meeting and a fistfight ensued. Calm was however restored with no injuries sustained. Jubilee Nakuru chairperson James Karimi condemned the chaos saying that the office will be streamlined and all issues concerning the aspirants addressed.
