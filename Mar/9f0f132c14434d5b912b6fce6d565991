Gospel singer Peter Blessing is thanking Size 8 for featuring him in her album 'Gospel Anthem'. The two artistes have collaborated on a wedding song, 'Zawadi Yangu'. Speaking in an interview with Chris Baraka and Family, Blessing said Size 8 reached out to him after he did the song 'Tam Tam'. "Imagine, a big artiste like her sharing my song, I felt so good," he said. "Size 8 called me and told me she was working on an album and she wanted me to go do a song with her. "I was so shocked that I cancelled all the appointments I had that day and jumped into the studio immediately." Peter Blessing came to the limelight after Bahati signed him on his record label EMB. The two later fell out.
