Zetech University Titans will be crowned the Kenya Basketball Federation Division One champions if they beat Africa Nazarene University  Wolf Packs at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. This mouth-watering Game Four meeting, the only fixture on the card this weekend, will tip-off at 4 pm. The Titans lead the best of five playoff series 2-1. Zetech coach Job Munene blamed complacency and over-confidence for the 73-68 Game Three loss and promised to avoid Game Five by finishing the job. By virtue of battling in the finals, both teams have already gained promotion to the 2022 Premier League that tips off later this month. The men’s Premier League finals have been put on hold until an appeal case lodged by Equity Bank against Kenya Port’s Authority is heard and determined. KPA women won the Premier League crown beating Equity Bank Hawks in Mombasa last week. Eldonets women won the Division One title. The Division Two men’s title was lifted by Jono Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Stray Cats. And they did it in style without losing a game while season.
