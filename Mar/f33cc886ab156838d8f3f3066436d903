Ministry of Health has denied lifting the mandatory wearing of facemasks in public places. In a statement, the Ministry stated that the directive remains in place and that it has not directed Kenyans to stop wearing masks. The  Ministry said it will advise Kenyan in case of any revision of Covid-19 measures. "It has come to our notice that there is a document circulating in the media purporting to come up with revised restriction measures on Covid-19. "The document is not from the Ministry of Health and is therefore not authentic. If and when the Government revises the restrictions we shall make it public in the usual manner," the statement said. On Wednesday, a letter purported to be from the ministry of health went viral on social media. Details of the letter indicated that the health ministry had lifted mandatory wearing of the facemask. The letter quoted Health CS mutahi Kagwe saying mandatory wearing of the facemask has been lifted effective March 1, 2022. " The Ministry recommends that with effect from March 1, 2022, the mandatory wearing of face masks in open spaces be lifted," the statement read. The letter also revealed that those travelling in public service vehicles, aircraft and working in offices will have to keep wearing masks because of proximity to their colleagues. "One will be required to wear a mask when in contact with other people in closed/ confined spaces such as PSVs, Aircraft, offices."
