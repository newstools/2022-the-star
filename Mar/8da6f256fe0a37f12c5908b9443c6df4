Gusii elders' council wants politicians stopped from dishing out money to minors during campaigns. The group further wants aspirants to desist from hiring goons to heckle other leaders during rallies as part of the efforts aimed at fostering unity, peace and cohesion among the community. Group chair James Matundura, in a statement to journalists on Monday, said the region and country at large stand to lose if politicians would not be tamed from certain behaviours which may spark animosity. "It has been noted with concern that some politicians are transporting youths to heckle other leaders in rallies and funerals. As elders we believe this is not the right direction we want to go and want all those who do so to stop," said Matundura. The giving of handouts to children, he noted, is eroding the virtues of hard work among them. The group chair further spoke of a growing culture where elderly politicians were being subjected to embarrassment in rallies by younger leaders. " As a society of people who believe in the virtues that glue us together, we must learn to respect our elders and maintain dignity among our peoples. We should stop the barbaric culture of using abusive language by calling other people names to gain sympathy from supporters," the elders said. The sentiments by the group come on the backdrop of the recent heckling of elderly politicians - Sam Ongeri and Chris Obure- during the Azimio rally on Friday in Kisii. Ongeri was the subject of the intense booing as he spoke to drum up support for Raila Odinga. A section of the angry youth in the crowd threw bottles of water to the dais as he addressed the crowd. Ongeri and Obure are eying the Kisii gubernatorial seat on ODM and Jubilee Parties respectively. The heckling of the two politicians has since been condemned by various leaders and the clergy from the region.
