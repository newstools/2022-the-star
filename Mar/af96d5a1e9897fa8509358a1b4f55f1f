Yesterday the American government banned Mike Mbuvi Sonko and his family from travelling to the United States because of his alleged involvement in corruption. It is ironic that it has happened at a time when Kenya has started to make real progress on prosecuting corruption cases. Many cases are in court and some guilty parties have actually been sent to jail. That is definitely progress. However there are many cases that have become bogged down by delaying tactics from the defence and by appeal and counter-appeal. Two things need to happen. Firstly, the courts should not tolerate time-wasting. Judges should allocate days to hear a case which should then proceed whatever happens. The defendant should not be allowed to derail the prosecution. Secondly, election appeals have to be concluded within six months. The same rule should apply to corruption cases. They should also be finished within six months. That will be good for everybody. If the defendant is innocent, he or she will be able to stand for political office and continue normal life. But the guilty ones will go to jail before it is too late.
