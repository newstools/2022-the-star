Residents in Kochia, Rangwe constituency, have protested against a poorly built bridge connecting two villages in the area. The residents expressed anger at the contractor who built Maugo bridge. Among the issues the residents complained about was the poor workmanship at the bridge  which would deter students from going to school when it rained. The five-kilometre road connects Olare, Angiro and Otolo villages. The residents led by William Odero, Rose Ojweke and Elsa Auma said they are concerned that the structure predisposes them to danger. It was to replace the old metal bridge which was set up some years back. Odero argued that the structure is already blocking water from flowing freely  in river Maugo. The construction is being undertaken by Kenya Rural Roads Authority . “The contractor put round culverts, instead of a bridge, which do not allow easy passage of water downstream. The bridge will get over-flooded and make children unable to cross while going to school,” Odero said. Speaking to journalists at the bridge, Odero who is the chairman of East Kochia Development Forum  asked KeRRA to recall the contractor. He claimed the structure would be easily swept away by floods during heavy rains. Flash floods are usually witnessed in Kochia and its surroundings. On Monday, Ojweke said local farmers have reported losses from floods. She said she is among the farmers whose crops were destroyed last week when water from the river flooded their farms. “We were pleased when the project started. We had no idea that it had consequences that would lead to economic losses,” Ojweke said. Auma is also decrying the same losses. She had a farm where she harvested kales to sell at the local market. KeRRA representative Lillian Nyajowi asked the residents to stop protesting saying the work is yet to be completed. (Edited by Francis Wadegu)
