Business came to a standstill in Machakos town Saturday afternoon as locals lineup on roads to witness the arrival of the Azimio campaign brigade led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. The campaign team was scheduled to hold a rally at the Old Naivas roundabout on its fourth day of the nine-day marathon campaigns that started last Wednesday in Nakuru County. Some of the residents who spoke to the Star said they arrived in Machakos town as early as 6.00am to witness the event and satisfy their desire to see Raila one-on-one and not on TV. "I 'm Raila's die hard fan and I had to get to Machakos town as early as 6.00am this morning since I'm eager to physically see him. I only watch him on television but I have to see him live today," James Kiio said. On his part, Joseph Mutie described Raila as a revolutionist who, if given a chance to lead this country, he will positively transform it. "Personally, I'm already campaigning for him, we will work hard to mobilise votes and delivery his victory," Mutie said. Local Kamba artists entertained the Azimio la Umoja fans who braved the scorching sun as they waited patiently for the arrival of the campaign convoy. They danced to melodious music pelted by the singers while at it. Several political aspirants seeking various positions at the August polls had their campaign banners displayed in Machakos streets by their youthful supporters. Raila is accompanied by Suna East MP Junet Muhammed, Kieni's Kanini Kega, Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, Nzioka Waita, and the three Ukambani governors among other leaders. The team is expected to hold a series of stopover rallies in Athi River and Mlolongo.
