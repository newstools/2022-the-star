Two women were on Monday afternoon arrested for allegedly engaging in drug trafficking. The suspects, Caroline Mariwa and  Nancy Wangare are said to have been ferrying bhang when the detectives intercepted the vehicle at Saba Saba after a dramatic chase. Police seized the consignment of Marijuana which they suspect was being ferried from Busia to Nairobi. According to the DCI, the product had been neatly arranged in a grey Toyota Wish and was being driven by one of the ladies. "In a bid to evade police roadblocks and deliver their supply successfully, the duo had taken the Nakuru-Nyahururu-Nyeri-Murang’a highway," DCI reported. Detectives said they were alerted by the public and responded swiftly. The suspects are currently being processed at DCI headquarters and will be arraigned on Tuesday.
