Gatundu South Member of Parliament Moses Kuria has rallied Mount Kenya leaders to allow Narc Kenya leader led the region. Speaking in Kiambu during the burial of Waititu’s mother, Kuria said that the Mount Kenya region should speak in one voice. The Gatundu South MP implored Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua and Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki to quit their ambitions, if any, of leading the Mt Kenya region and back Karua. Kuria said the Narc Kenya leader is experienced enough to lead the Mt Kenya region even as President Uhuru Kenyatta heads to retirement. “I know Gachagua, Kindiki and others have the potential to lead the community but let us allow Martha Karua to lead us, I also had the ambitions but I was sat down and requested to shelve them and I agreed, “he said. The politically charged funeral saw Kuria declare that joining Azimio la Umoja is not an option for him as the country heads to the August 9, polls. “Unajua kwa hii uhai mimi ndio ninajiamulia, hakuna siku utanipata kwa Azimio…lakini hata nikikufa, msinipeleke kwa Azimio (In this life, I’m the one to make the decision about my direction, you’ll never see me in Azimio…and even if I die, don’t take me to Azimio).” Kuria, who is the Chama Cha Kazi party leader, is eyeing the Kiambu governor seat. He recently announced interest in joining the One Kenya Alliance but told the team that he will not be a party to them if they work with Azimio.
