The Tana Water Works Development Agency requires Sh84 billion to implement 27 planned projects in five counties within Mt Kenya region. The projects are geared towards attainment of 100 per cent water supply and sewerage coverage for  more than 1.3 million people in Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Meru counties. Out of the 27 planned projects, five worth Sh2.9 billion are in Nyeri, two worth Sh1.3 billion (Kirinyaga), nine worth Sh47 billion (Embu), five worth Sh26 billion (Tharaka Nithi) and six worth Sh6 billion (Meru). TWWDA chief executive officer Philip Gichuki said if the projects are implemented, a total of Sh93 billion will be spent bringing the total number of projects to 188 and serve more than three million people. They include dams, boreholes and sanitation projects among others. The agency serves a total projected population of four million in the five counties. They spoke during the media breakfast meetings the agency has been undertaking in its coverage areas to create awareness on TWWDA mandate. The agency was in Nyeri Thursday. Gichuki said there are a number of projects that are under implementation citing Nyeri which has last mile sewerage connectivity in Othaya, since 2019, it's completed and people are getting connected. “We are also looking forward to improving the water coverage because at the moment we are below 70 per cent,” he said. The duty of the agency is to develop infrastructure that will increase coverage by 2030 to ensure everybody in urban and rural centres access clean water. Sewerage overage should also be increased to about 80 per cent. In Nyeri they have planned for Naromoru and Karatina axis which he said is growing very fast and they have developed a plan to provide adequate water to Noromoru - Karatina. Mweiga - Kiawara axis is another area growing fast and they are focusing on how they can improve the water and sewerage coverage.
