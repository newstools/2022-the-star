Chief Justice Martha Koome on Monday admitted 113 lawyers to the Roll of Advocates at the Supreme Court in Nairobi. During her speech, Koome commended the new lawyers for the transition from students of law to practitioners. She challenged the newly admitted lawyers to be ready to go an extra mile to ensure everyone, including the vulnerable gets justice. “I urge the lawyers to be ready to go an extra mile to ensure that the vulnerable in our society, such as victims of gender-based violence, children, persons living with disabilities, and persons from minority and marginalized communities, are enabled to access justice.” Koome further advised them to adopt the multi-door approach to the delivery of justice, which includes the use of Small Claims Courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution to amend societal injustices. The CJ further challenged the 113 individuals to embrace their personal ethics in the course of their practice. She encouraged them that there is enough space for them to occupy without being unethical, citing her success. The Director of Kenya School of Law Henry Mutai urged the advocates to observe integrity in the society and to instil confidence in the practice of the legal profession, which will have an impact on their clients.
