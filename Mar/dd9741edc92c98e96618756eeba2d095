National team coaches Peter Mwathi and Jack Ochieng were among 40 tacticians who attended a three-day Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) course at Strathmore University. The duo, who handles the men and women’s teams, respectively lauded the training and concurred that continued learning is what the game needs to move a step up. However, they bemoaned failure by national leagues teams to send representatives to the clinic, save for National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), who sent five. The course was conducted by Martin Berger, an A-licence trainer ­— the highest level of training for handball coaches in Germany. He is also attached to Handball.Inspire, a global organisation focusing on handball training skills. The tacticians, men and women, came from Nairobi, Central, Rift Valley and Nyanza. They were engaged in both theory and practical training. “It has been a good learning experience. He (Berger) has a lot of stuff for those who are learning for the first time and also for the experienced,” said Mwathi, who also handles Strathmore teams. “He put us through session planning, an area vital in team training. He has different methods of handling players­ — both juniors and seniors. This will add a lot of value to the participants.” Ochieng, who coaches national and regional women champions Nairobi Water Queens had a lot of praise for the instructor and asked fellow coaches to never miss such opportunities in the future. “The coaches who handle teams at the top and failed to come for the training missed a lot. Learning is continuous since new tactics always come up,” he noted.
