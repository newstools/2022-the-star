United Democratic Alliance party has suffered yet again after its key official called it quits. The party's deputy national organizing secretary Wanjala Iyaya left the party on Wednesday and joined the Azimio La Umoja affiliated party, DAP-K. DAP-K took to its Twitter to announce the move and said Iyaya was accompanied by the TACUSO elders who affirmed the support for Azimio La Umoja. Iyaya is eyeing Webuye East parliamentary seat. He was welcomed by party officials including Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi, Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa, Lugari MP Ayub Savula and other party officials. His defection is a blow to UDA which lost its treasurer Omingo Magara to the Azmio camp just a day ago. Magara on Tuesday announced that his political aspirations do not align with the UDA party hence the decision to quit. Magara joined the ruling Jubilee party, an affiliate of the Azimio la Umoja. DAP-K is a party formed by a splinter group of the Moses Wetangula-led  Ford Kenya party. The party has won big since its formation following the entry of key Western leaders into it. The party seeks to wrestle with Ford Kenya and ANC for the control of Western Kenya.
