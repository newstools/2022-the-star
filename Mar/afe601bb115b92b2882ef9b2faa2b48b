Candidates who will be floored in the party primaries still have a chance to contest as independent candidates, Registrar of Political Parties has clarified. Registrar Anne Nderitu on Thursday said candidates who will be unsuccessful in the primaries will still have a chance to be on the ballot as independent candidates. They however cannot join another political party as the window to be a member of a political outfit closes on March 26. Under the amended Political Parties Act, Party primaries are expected to conclude nomination by April 22. Independent candidates have up to May 2 to submit their symbols. "As the law stands now, within those ten days, someone can vie as an independent candidate," Nderitu said. She was speaking on Thursday when she appeared before National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigani. The Registrar is updating the powerful committee on the status of the implementation of the amended act.
