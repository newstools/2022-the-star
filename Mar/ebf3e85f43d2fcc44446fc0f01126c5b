Scorpions' Melvin Muga says she feels more comfortable playing in the centre back position than as a full-back even as she prepares to make her debut in the Kenya Hockey Union Premier League in a fortnight. The former Multi-Media University player captained the students in the Super League before the covid-19 enforced break. Her impressive performance in the full-back position as well as in midfield caught the eyes of Scorpions coach Meshack Senge who roped her into his squad this year. The 24-year old is itching for action and has her fingers crossed that she will be in the starting lineup when Scorpions entertain Sliders in their first match on March 13 at City Park Stadium. The league kicks off on March 5. "I enjoy every moment training as a centre back and I look forward to making an appearance against Sliders. Diana Awino, Tracy Nyang' and I are the only available centre-backs and the competition is healthy," Muga said. "I have never played in the top tier before but I am confident that I have the qualities to blossom into one of the finest players in the league. I have, however, played in friendly matches and I feel I am good enough to start." Muga credited her teammates for helping her settle quickly at Scorpions. "They (teammates) are accommodative. Even though I have not played with most of them, I got to blend in so fast. One thing I realised, they got your back, whether in training or during a match." "You won't feel guilty when you make a mistake because they will cover up for you and then get to correct you when it's cool enough," she explains. Muga highlights that fitness is mandatory at Strathmore. "Fitness is something so key at this club.  We are about 80 per cent during training and this has helped us to get to know each other, individual strengths and weaknesses thus making it easier to work together as a team." She adds: "My fitness is on another level and confidence has moved a notch higher."
