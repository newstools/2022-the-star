Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has defended the CBC, saying it is good for the country. He said the Competency-Based Curriculum will produce self-reliant youth. However Mandago said the government should properly engage parents and teachers and set aside adequate funds to facilitate implementation so that parents are not over burdened. The governor said he was a parent with children who had gone through the 8-4-4 programme and younger ones undertaking CBC and that already he had observed differences between the two systems. “Even the very young ones in CBC can do so many things on their own. They can even fix some parts in the car, wash the house or even cook," Mandago said. The county chief said parents and all Kenyans are ready to embrace the CBC if well implemented. “The CBC is a good programme because will create a country of dependable people as we develop.” Recently Nandi Governor Stephen Sang also asked the government to consult widely on how best to strengthen the education system instead of ignoring concerns raised by parents and teachers. Sang said the complainants not opposed to CBC but want it improved for the benefit of learners and the country. He asked Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha to avoid being abrasive whenever issues are raised regarding the curriculum, but instead adopt an open-door approach to criticism for improvement. At the same time, Mandago asked parents with children that have different disabilities not to discriminate against them. Mandago spoke when he presided over the official opening of a dining hall and kitchen at Illula Centre for Albinism. He said children living with various disabilities were endowed with talents that can be exploited through exposure and access to education, among other programmes. “We now have institutions all over to cater for children with various abilities and no parent should deny their children such benefits, especially education,” Mandago said.
