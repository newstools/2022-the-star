Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga has termed the move by Mukhisa Kituyi to back ODM leader Raila Odinga presidential bid inconsequential. Mabonga said the former UNCTAD boss will not deliver any votes to Azimio la Umoja movement. On Friday, Kituyi announced he had shelved his ambition to run for president in favour of Raila. Mabonga was speaking on Saturday at Myanga market in Bungoma during the Kenya Kwanza rally. He said Kituyi has been working abroad for many years but has done nothing for the people of Bungoma. “We don’t want people to pretend that they are supporting Raila's presidential bid, they should show us what they have done for people," Mabonga said. "Mukhisa never used his opportunity in power to help our people." Mwambu warned Kituyi to stop attacking Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa saying the work that Barasa has done in one term is tremendous and cannot be equated to what Kituyi did during his tenure. Mabonga further told off Raila to stop accusations against DP Ruto and find something else to tell Kenyans in his campaign rallies. “In Kenya Kwanza we decided not to play  bad politics against our opponents, Raila's brigade should style up," Mabonga said. "Politics is not about throwing stones at each other." (Edited Tabnacha O)
