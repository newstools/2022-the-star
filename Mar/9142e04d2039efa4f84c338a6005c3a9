Shell has said they are seeking alternatives as they intend to stop buying Russian oil. In a statement, the company said it has had to make a tough decision on shutting down its service station and other operations in the country amid international pressure to cut its ties with Russia following the Ukraine invasion. “We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel, despite being made with the security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking, was not the right one and we are sorry," Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said. This decision comes just days after Ukraine’s foreign minister criticised Shell for continuing to buy Russian oil and continuing to do business with the enemy. “We will continue to choose alternatives to Russian oil whenever possible, but this cannot happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply,” they said. The company said the change will take weeks to complete and will lead to reduced throughput at some of its refineries. “We welcome any direction or insights from governments and policymakers as we try to keep the business moving.”
