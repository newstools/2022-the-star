Kenya's top-ranked junior Angela Okutoyi is seeking to improve her performance further during the second leg of the ITF Women's Futures tournament starting today in Egypt. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion lost in the quarterfinals to Ziva Falkner of Slovenia 6-2, 6-3 last week and says she is looking to go all the way in the second event. “I hope I can go all the way. I am determined to make up for last week's loss and play to my very best this week,” said Okutoyi. She noted that she has already adjusted to the hot and humid conditions in Egypt and hopes to do well. “The conditions are quite tough but I have adjusted accordingly and I am ready for this leg of the tournament,” she added. Okutoyi is using this and the other two tournaments in North Africa to prepare for the French Open in May. She expressed confidence she will be in peak condition by the time the second Grand Slam of the year starts. " I'm also playing in Tunisia, Morocco, and Italy before the French Open.  I believe I will be well prepared having acquainted myself on the murram surface from the hardcourt, where I was playing on during the Australian Open, ” added Okutoyi.
