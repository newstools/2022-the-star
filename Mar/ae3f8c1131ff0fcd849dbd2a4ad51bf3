Police officers in Bungoma have arrested six theft suspects and recovered stolen goods. Geoffrey Shikuku, alias Mubaba, Scovia Wanjala Wanyonyi, Farid Hussein, Ali Mohammed, alias Msaja (a Ugandan), Balabina Ambuka, alias Mama Iddi, and Ahmed Noor, alias Morio, (a Ugandan) are detained at Bungoma police station waiting to be arraigned. Bungoma South police commander Benjamin Kimwele said the suspects were arrested during a three-day operation by officers from Bungoma police station. “Police officers from Bungoma police station have been conducting an operation in areas bordering Bungoma town where they were able to recover goods in Ranje, Kanduyi, Kibabii and Mayanja,” he said. The items that were recovered include TV sets, carpets, gas cylinders, woofers, assorted new shoes, new clothes, computers, mattresses and housebreaking gadgets. Kimwele asked those whose goods were stolen to visit Bungoma police station and find out if the recovered items are among them. He said the station has new vehicles to enhance patrols and other operations in the town and its environs. “This is not the end of the operation. I will intensify this to ensure more suspects are brought to book. I also ask members of the public to help in reporting suspicious individuals within their locality,” Kimwele said. Maryanne Maina, one of the business operators whose boutique was broken into and goods worth Sh500,000 stolen, urged police officers to intensify night patrols. “My shop was broken into and I have only recovered shoes worth Sh20,000,” she said.
