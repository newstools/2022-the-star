Former Kisii Woman Representative Mary Otara has condemned last week's incident where youths heckled some leaders during ODM leader Raila Odinga’s visit to the area. She said it is wrong for some leaders to misuse the youth to gain political mileage ahead of the August 9 polls. “Some leaders are taking the country backwards in terms of democracy. They cannot use the youth to heckle other leaders during campaigns,” Otara told the Star on the phone. Last week, Senator Sam Ongeri, who is seeking to succeed Governor James Ongwae, was booed when Raila toured the area. “I'm advising our young people to stop joking with leaders like Ongeri. They should respect them,” she added. Otara, who served one term before she was defeated by incumbent Janet Ong’era, said every leader has a right to sell his or her policies and agenda in every corner of Kisii county. She urged those seeking elective seats to conduct peaceful campaigns and avoid politics that could divide the country. Others who have declared interest in the governor's seat include Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu, former Transport CAS Chris Obure, KNC leader Manson Nyamweya, MP Simba Arati (Dagoretti North), Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Kisii Governance Watch secretary Rachael Otundo, UDA national treasurer Omingo Magara, Charles Matoke, Alfred Akunga and Josiah Onyacha. Otundo, the only woman in the Kisii governor race, also condemned the incident. “I am urging our voters to look at reality and vote for personalities and not parties. Parties have their owners,” she said. Edited by A.N
