World marathon record holder Eliud Kipchoge has pleaded with the world to unite as he dedicated his Tokyo marathon win to peace. Kipchoge won the Tokyo Marathon in a new course record of 2:02:40 on Sunday morning in Japan. This is the fourth fastest marathon ever ran by Kipchoge. "I am so proud to win in the streets of Tokyo, where the people have running in their heart and minds," he said. Kipchoge said it was great to know that his winnings are now four out of six  Abbott World Marathon Major races. "Finally, I want to say I want this world to unite. My win today is to bring positivity in this world," he said. The two-time Olympic marathon champion, alongside the women's world record holder Brigid Kosgei, were the star attraction at the March 6 event, which makes a return after it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Kipchoge zipped through the opening stages and was even making world record pace initially. But a wrong turn in the third 5km section saw the pace drop. However, the overall standard remained impressive. " I’m really happy and being back here in Japan after winning the Olympic Games [at the marathon race] in Sapporo… When I said ‘I run strong in Japan’ I did it by running a 2:02. This is my fourth time to win World Major Marathon. I’m really happy," he said during a national TV interview after the win. Kpchoge's plea comes as Russia and Ukraine are at war with each other. As at Sunday, an estimated 3,000 Americans have answered Ukraine's call for foreign volunteers to fight Russia's invasion, a representative from the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington DC told the Voice of America news service. Western nations are not sending troops to fight on the ground in Ukraine, but have been delivering arms to Ukraine to help in the country's fight. They have also brought in punishing economic sanctions against Russia and Russian oligarchs and leaders.
