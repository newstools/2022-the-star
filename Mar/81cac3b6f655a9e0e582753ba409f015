Tanzanian video vixen Nana Dollz has distanced herself from the ongoing divorce between Alikiba and his wife Amina Khalef. A video went viral showing the video vixen and the singer in a cosy situation while shooting his music video, 'Utu.' Fans accused the vixen of being part of the split. Speaking to Wasafi media, Dollz said, "How sure are you that woman asked for a divorce? Are you sure?" she asked. "The couple has not come to social media and told their fans they are splitting. They haven't even said the video clip is the cause." Dollz added that the clip was just part of her work. "It was not hard to shoot it. I didn't see anything bad about that scene, there are people doing cosier scenes than that one." She went on to ask fans to stop judging her. "You can never judge someone you don't know. About 99 per cent of people on social media don't know celebrities' real lives. I used to care but I don't anymore." She is dating a partner who is not active on social media. "My boyfriend doesn't like social media. My boyfriend had a problem with it because people were pressuring him. Family and friends would send him the video. He felt disturbed." On why she supports Diamond Platnumz, she said he is her favourite. "I love him. I cannot stop listening to his songs just because I worked with Kiba. I am a businesswoman. I might work with him tomorrow. I am in no team. I work with any artiste." In court documents, Amina cited infidelity, verbal abuse and frustrations from in-laws among the issues that led her to settle on the dissolution of the union.
