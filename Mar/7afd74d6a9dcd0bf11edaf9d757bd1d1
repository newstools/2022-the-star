The Sinendet-Kisumu pipeline at Kanyamedha area is spilling diesel again after a pipe burst. The area is currently condoned with access only allowed to police and KPC officials. Kisumu central OCPD Anthony Maina said police was called after a leak was detected. "I can't say exactly what happened that our officers have been at the scene from day one securing the area as work is being done and keeping locals away," he said. A source privy to the happenings told the Star that a heavy construction vehicle that was being operated on at the site broke an already repaired pipeline which caused the diesel transit to spill. It's said to have lasted on 20 minutes before it was contained. This comes a day after an oil spillage was detected along the same line on Friday around midnight. Kenya Pipeline Company said it had contained the oil spill. The company urged residents to keep off to allow repairs and avert disaster. KPC is yet to establish the number of litres of fuel that has been lost following the spillage. In a statement, KPC MD Macharia Irungu said the incident has not affected the availability of petroleum products in the county and region.
