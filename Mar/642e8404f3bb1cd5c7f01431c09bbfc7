Former Chief Justice Willy Mutunga has said that Kenyans should expect another handshake after the August polls. Speaking during an interview on Citizen TV on Wednesday, Mutunga said this time around, the handshake will be between ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto. “One of the two fractions will win and if there is the threat to peace, the foreign nations will just tell us to have another handshake,” Mutunga said. His sentiments come on the day when President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga are celebrating the fourth anniversary of a truce that forestalled war. The historic handshake between the two bitter political rivals toned down the political temperature in a country. While a majority of Kenyans, investors and the international community welcomed the handshake, DP Ruto and his supporters read malice in the reconciliation. This led to the growing tensions and rivalry between Raila and Ruto, which Mutunga says will lead to a political truce in the near future. He added that it is crucial for Kenyans to understand that the politicians will never deliver their promises. “It’s important for Kenyans to know that the political leaders aren’t going to keep their promise... They have no agenda in implementing the Constitution,” he said.
