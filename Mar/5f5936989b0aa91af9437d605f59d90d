Kenya Simbas will have a training camp later this month in readiness for the Currie Cup next month in South Africa. Paul Odera's charges resumed training last month with strength and conditioning sessions every Tuesday and Thursday. The training is, however, set to intensify after the Kenya Cup final on March 12. Speaking Yesterday, team manager, Jimmie Mnene, said the response so far has been superb and he expects the players to be in good condition by the time the tournament starts in April. “Our preparation may have delayed a bit but with a month or so to go before we play our first competitive match, we will be in good shape,” he added. The 66 home-based players have been split into three training camps with the Nairobi-based players training at RFUEA ground. The Kakamega-based players are training at the ASK showground while the Nakuru-based players are at the Menengai Oilers ground. Mnene said the players will be much fitter than the November Test Tour in South Africa, where they only trained for two weeks. “This time around, we will be much fitter. We have already started our preparations and once we assemble later this month, we will focus on skill work,” he noted. Prior to the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, the Simbas played in the Vodacom Cup in South Africa under Jerome Paarwater. Elsewhere, Impala Saracens playmaker Sammy Oliech is set to serve a-four week ban following a red card in their match against MMUST Rugby Club. The referee’s report confirmed that Oliech was sent off in the 75th minute after his shoulder made contact with the tackled player’s head. The MMUST player was stretchered off and could not continue with the match. With Impala not heading to the Kenya Cup knock-out stages, his sanction is set to commence during the Enterprise Cup. Further sanctions would depend on the progress of his team.
