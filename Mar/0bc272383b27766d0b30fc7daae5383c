Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has invited South Sudan's leaders for talks on the peace process in their country. The meeting will bring together President Salva Kiir, Riek Machar and four other vice-presidents to discuss and evaluate the implementation of the 2018 revitalised peace agreement. The leaders are expected to discuss the challenges facing the implementation of the peace deal. Observers say most provisions of the agreement are yet to be implemented, including the graduation of the unified security forces.
