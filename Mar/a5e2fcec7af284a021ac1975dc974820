Kenya Commercial Bank  RFC coach Curtis Olago is adamant their great performance in the just-concluded Kenya Cup season puts them in a prime position to win their semi-final tie against Menengai Oilers on Saturday. The bankers beat bitter rivals Kabras Sugar 28-20 in their last match of the season at Ruaraka Sports Club over the weekend to extend their unbeaten streak to 11 games. "I want to thank our players for their sheer lion heart to seal this win today against a worthy opponent. Our technical bench and fans have also played an immense role in pushing us beyond our limits as a team," Olago said. KCB won 10 of their matches and drew one to finish second on 48 points, two behind the sugar millers. Nonetheless, any encounter against the Oilers is often a sweaty affair considering KCB scrapped out a 23-18 in the last meeting between both sides. Olago is hopeful their win over Kabras Sugar will spur his charges towards the final. "It is not easy to win against Kabras, and today’s victory gives us the confidence we need for the next stage of the league," the former Kenya sevens centre said. Menengai lost 13-8 to Nakuru to hand a lifeline to the latter who were staring at relegation. In the other semi-final tie, Kabras will tussle with Strathmore Leos. Leos finished fourth with 29 points despite a 17-3 loss to Kenyatta University Black Blad. It was a weekend of much tears and joy in the rugby scene as the curtains came down on the season. Former champions Nondescripts and Kenya Harlequins were relegated to the second tier after finishing bottom and second-bottom respectively. Nondies lost 13-7 to Homeboyz RFC at their Jamhuri Park showground home as Quins were walloped 24-8 by Mwamba RFC.
