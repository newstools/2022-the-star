Celebrated on March 8 annually, Women’s Day seeks to celebrate women in their different areas of life. The day recognizes achievements of women globally in the different aspects of social, political, economic and cultural impacts across the globe while promising to recognize their struggle, social inequity and unjust stereotypes. In Kenya, women’s day does carry a little significance, from highlighting the plight of women who are victims of inequality or violence of any form, lack of education, gender discrimination, and poor health care systems. The groups and organisations are there to voice and champion for the rights, but minimal is done to counter this challenge. The efforts to voice these challenges, however, either fall on deaf ears or are backed by empty promises from the government or a brutal patriarchal social structure. We have witnessed all of these unjust actions happening to women across the country and it is either we sugar coat, ignore and thank God it is not us or just easily forget that we ought to raise our voices in fighting this patriarchal oppression which is a plague of this nation. Silence will not help us counter the bitter truth, let us all face this elephant in the room once and for all. This year’s theme which is #BreakTheBias calls for action against what women face on a daily basis.
