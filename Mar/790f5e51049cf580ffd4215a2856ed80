@ppcheti At least 26 KCPE candidates in Lamu have not sat their exam. The recent al Shabaab terror attacks in the region have been blamed. The attacks between January 2 and 9 led to the death of 15 people while thousands were displaced. Lamu county education director Joshua Kaaga said the candidates did not show up in their various centres. He said some candidates didn’t show up as their families had migrated shortly after the attacks. “Some of the missing candidates had sat the exams last year and failed and thereafter registered this year but changed their minds,” Kaaga said. He said some students decided to join TVETs instead of having to sit the exams twice. Others moved away with their parents. This year, there are no special cases in Lamu where students are sitting for exams while pregnant, sick, or in hospitals. Meanwhile, Lamu has in recent years recorded great strides in the number of girls enrolling in school. This is revealed by the number of girls currently sitting for KCSE and just concluded KCPE exams compared to previous years. Some 3,661 candidates, 1,845 boys and 1,816 girls sat the KCPE exams in Lamu. “The range between the boys and girls is very small. We’re almost achieving gender parity in terms of pupils’ enrolment and access to education across the county,” Kaaga said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
