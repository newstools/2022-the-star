OKA principals Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi on Sunday held lengthy discussions with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The meeting at State House Nakasero, Kampala centred on the current situation in South Sudan and particularly the planned retreat between President Salva Kiir and his first Vice President Riek Machar. Last month, Machar was sworn in as first vice-president, sealing a peace deal aimed at ending six years of civil war. Kiir witnessed the moment at a ceremony at the State House in the capital, Juba. It is hoped that the new unity government will bring an end to the conflict that has left almost half a million people dead. On Sunday, a dispatch from Kalonzo's communication team said the three leaders also discussed bilateral issues between Kenya and Uganda. Kalonzo is a special envoy to the Republic of South Sudan. However, the involvement of Gideon remains unclear. Museveni is seen to be gravitating towards Deputy President William Ruto in the upcoming polls and has hosted him many times. It remains unclear if the Kenyan succession politics featured. In its communique, Wiper said Kalonzo earlier held discussions with former Ugandan Special Envoy to South Sudan Betty Bigombe and British High Commissioner to Uganda Kate Airey at the Serena Hotel, Kampala. Bigombe was also present at the State House meeting. “The earlier talks generally focused on the status of the security regime of the Revitalised -Agreement on the Resolutions of the Conflict in South Sudan and in particular the unification of the two armies. "This has resulted in great delay of the peace process considering that the lifespan of the R-ARCSS is expected to lapse in less than a year,” the statement said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
