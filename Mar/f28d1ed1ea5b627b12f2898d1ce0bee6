Gaspo women's team drop in form has been attributed to the absence of skillful attacker Bertha Omita. Team manager Edward Githua said  Omita incurred a muscle injury in late January, which has sidelined her from play up to now. The Kiambu county-based side have managed two draws in as many matches, falling to third place with 18 points in the Kenya Women's Premier League— seven behind leaders Vihiga Queens. The two points they picked against Ulizi Starlets (1-1) and Trans-Nzoia Falcons (0-0) saw the defending champions Thika Queens displace them from the second spot. Fourth-placed Falcons are just a point behind Gaspo. Prior to Omita's setback, Gaspo were on a scoring spree, thanks to the maverick striker who also had the ability to inspire the rest of the squad. The immediate former Simba Queens FC striker managed six goals. No return date has been given for Omita who played for Kisumu All Starlets before heading to Tanzania. "Omita's absence is really hurting us. She had settled into the team and made the difference but we must now cope without her," Githua said. "She is only working on the gym but hasn't returned to training. The physios are yet to provide the full details." Meanwhile, Githua said they will file a complaint to the FKF Caretaker Committee after poor officiating denied them points against Falcons on Sunday. "The referee was biased and favoured our opponents. All decisions went against us. Wadadia and Nakuru have had similar cases with the very official and we want to stop this from happening," he claimed. He also wants the retired Aaron Ringera-led committee to provide statistics for the teams and players. "We have never been updated on the players with bookings (either red or yellow cards). We also don't know when the mid-season transfer window opens. We might even play some second leg matches before the window opens."
