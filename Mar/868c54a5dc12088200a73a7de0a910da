The 2014 Commonwealth Games 5,000m champion Mercy Cherono believes the best is yet to come after an impressive third-place finish at the Castellon 10km race in Spain on Sunday. Cherono timed 30:48 as Ethiopian Yalemzerf Yehualaw set a world record of 29:14 to cross the finish line ahead of another Kenyan, Vicoty Chepngeno, who came second in 30:14. "It's just the beginning of a different venture. Today was my first ever 10km race in Castellon, Spain. Awesome experience on the road running," the 2013 World 5,000m silver medalist said. The 2011 Africa Cross Country Championship 8km champion has been busy since the commencement of the season, starting with the National Police Service Cross Country Championship at Ngong' Race Course. She was also part of the ladies' cast at the National Cross Country Championship as well as the Agnes Tirop Memorial World Cross Country Tour, both at Lobo Village in Eldoret. It was a siblings' affair in the men's race as 2013 World Cross Country junior team silver medalist Ronald Kwemoi timed a course record of 27:16 to overcome his brother, Samuel Chebolei. The national cross country champion clocked 27:18 to finish second as Ethiopian Tadese Tekele came third in 27:20. In Atlanta, it was a double delight for the country at the Atlanta Half Marathon as 2017 Valencia 10km champion Nicholas Kosimbei and Dorcas Tuitoek set new course records. Kosimbei clocked 1:00:36 to lead a clean Kenyan sweep as Raymond Magut (1:02:40) and Geoffrey Koech (1:03:13) came in second and third respectively. Another Kenyan, Micke Chesire, finished fourth in 1:03:38. Tuitoek led a clean podium sweep in the women's race, timing 1:08:22 ahead of Mary Munanu (1:10:00) and Viola Cheptoo (1:10:47). "I feel really great today...I am so excited. I had prepared myself well for this race and knew that I would perform well," the 2018 Paderborn Osterlauf 10km champion said. "Setting a new course record has really encouraged me because I made my marathon debut last year. Now I know that my speed is good and am looking forward to better results in the future." Elsewhere, Athletics Kenya have announced that this weekend's track and field weekend meeting will now be held in Nairobi and not Embu as earlier planned. Nairobi region chair Barnaba Korir said the venue change for the third leg of the annual series was made after deliberations with officials from the Eastern region. "We would like to inform our athletes that the third leg of AK track and field weekend meeting will be held at Nyayo Stadium on Friday and Saturday. The Nairobi region will be organising the event in collaboration with the team from Eastern region. We welcome all our athletes," Korir said. Nairobi also hosted the first leg of the series, which attracted a record number of athletes before Kisumu staged the second leg at Moi Stadium.
