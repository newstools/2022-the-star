James Maddison and Jamie Vardy were on target for Leicester City as they ended Burnley's mini-revival with a 2-0 win at Turf Moor in the Premier League on Monday. Two wins and a draw in their last three games meant Sean Dyche's Burnley would have got out of the bottom three with victory over the Foxes but Brendan Rodgers's side were deserved winners. Maddison put Leicester ahead in the 82nd minute, collecting a layoff from substitute Vardy and beating Burnley keeper Nick Pope with a superb curling shot. Vardy made sure of the three points with a straightforward header after being picked out by a perfect cross from Harvey Barnes. Leicester moved up to 12th place on 30 points while Burnley remain in 18th place on 21 points.
