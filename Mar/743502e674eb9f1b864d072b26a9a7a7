Comedian and content creator Oga Obinna joined Kiss FM yesterday. He will be co-hosting The Morning Kiss with Kamene Goro. Speaking to Word Is, Obinna described the love he received as overwhelming. "In the morning, I received a lot of calls from friends to wake me up to go to work," he said. "People called me to congratulate me, even people who haven't spoken to me for a long time. "My DMs is busy. For once, ladies are DMing me, and I like it. "I see radio as therapy for myself. I don't feel like I'm working cause I've had fun." So did he go for dates with Kamene to create their chemistry? "We are trying to find the professional aspect but we blended well, it is easy." He said he is being paid six times more than at his previous workplace. "It is adequate."
