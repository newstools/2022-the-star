Kabras RFCcoach Jerome Muller wants his side to improve at the lineout ahead of the Kenya Cup final against Menengai Oilers on Saturday. Despite a 29-9 win over Strathmore Leos in the semifinal, the South African tactician said apart from the lineout, there will be minimal improvements to be made ahead of their seventh consecutive final. “I'm not happy with our setpiece because we are not giving our backs enough ball to play with from the lineout when in the attack. This is why we want to address this in the next three days," said Muller. He said the side will have to focus for the 80 minutes to avoid last year's debacle in the final, where they led 20-0 at half-time only to lose 28-25 in extra time in Nandi. “I have told the boys to focus on the full 80 minutes. This will be a tough competitive final and we need to avoid the mistakes we did in last season's final, ” he noted. Muller said the side is highly motivated and relishing the challenge.  “The boys are in good spirits and they are aware of the task at hand," the coach noted. Muller termed their opponents as a dangerous side with very fastbacks and formidable back row. Muller added that discipline will be key and his side cannot afford to give cheap penalties to Oilers, especially with Geoffrey Ominde in the superb kicking form. “We have to watch our penalty count and ensure we don't concede in the kicking range." In the group phase encounter between both sides, the sugar millers were comfortable winners, winning 32-17. Menengai Oilers stunned champions KCB 24-17 in the other semifinal on Saturday. Kabras have played in seven consecutive finals since promotion to the top flight, winning only once in 2016 when they upset Impala 22-5 and losing five finals to KCB.
