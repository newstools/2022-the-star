ODM leader Raila Odinga and sensational singer Bahati on Monday released a music collaboration dubbed 'fire'. Fire is a phrase the ODM leader has commonly been using in his campaign rallies. In an analogy, Raila equates his supporters to an army, bullets to a voter's card. He always ends his speech by proclaiming 'fire', numerous times, to mean they should vote massively come August 9, polls to ensure he wins the presidency. The music video released at exactly 3 pm on Monday featured leaders allied to the Azimio La Umoja movement. Among the leaders who were involved in the music video included Raila, Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho, Governor Alfred Mutua (Machakos), MPs Kanini Kega (Kieni), Babu Owino (Embakasi East), Junet Mohamed (Suna East) and Nominated MP Maina Kamanda. The leaders were recorded dancing to the tune as they appeared to enjoy every beat of the song amidst peals of laughter. This is the second song the ODM leader is being featured in a song. Raila was first featured in his campaign signature song christened 'leo ni leo' by veteran singer Emmanuel Musindi. Being featured in music collaborations appears to be his new strategy to woo the youths who are fond of listening to modern music. Artists such as Bahati commands a fanatical following that can help politicians bag a huge number of votes in any contest. His press secretary Dennis Onsarigo, however, said it is his strategy to support the creative industry. Edited by B. Marita
