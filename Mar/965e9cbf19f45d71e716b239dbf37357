Kamba gospel artiste Stephen Kasolo has apologised to his fans after  a disturbing video of him threatening to kill his daughter went viral. He told his three-year-old daughter 'Nitakunyonga' (I will strangle you) while demonstrating it to her. He repeatedly asked his daughter to repeat the same words. The video sparked outrage on social media platforms, forcing the Kamba artiste to issue a public apology. "Praise God, my fans? I want to take this opportunity to apologise to my baby and all our fans for the video which is going viral," he said. "I never meant any harm to my daughter and I never will, nevertheless it has brought a lot of tension on social media. Kindly forgive me this will never happen again. I'm sorry even before God."
