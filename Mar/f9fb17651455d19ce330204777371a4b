Catholics all over the world will be observing Ash Wednesday today even as Pope Francis called for peace. Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent, occurring six and a half weeks before Easter. The day is a solemn reminder of human mortality and the need for reconciliation with God and marks the beginning of the penitential Lenten season. It is commonly observed with ashes and fasting. Pope Francis had previously announced Ash Wednesday as a Day of fasting for peace in Ukraine. “I renew my invitation for everyone to take part on March 2, Ash Wednesday, in a day of prayer and fasting for peace in Ukraine. In order to be near to suffering Ukrainian people, to be aware that we are all brothers and sisters and to implore God for an end to the war,” said Pope Francis in a tweet. The Pope urged the Christians to pray more intensely in the face of war that has no end in sight. “Let us all together cry out from our hearts never again war, never again a clash of arms, never again so much suffering. We must never stop praying. Indeed, let us pray to God more intensely. Come, Lord, prince of peace make us instruments and reflections of your peace,” he said. The Pope made the announcement even as Russia is still pressing on with its invasion of Ukraine, defying mounting global pressure that saw ICC open a probe on war crimes probe against it. According to Ukraine’s government, more than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed during the invasion, while more than half a million people have fled the country.
