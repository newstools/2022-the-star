A 39-year-old father shot dead his three children inside the Church in Sacramento in California. According to CNN, David Mora Rojas also fatally shot a male chaperone who was supervising a visit with his daughters Monday afternoon before turning the gun on himself. The mother of the children is said to have had a restraining order against the man. Sacramento Sheriff's office spokesperson Rodney Grassmann said that the three children killed were 9-year-old Samarah Mora Gutierrez, 10-year-old Samantha Mora Gutierrez and 13-year-old Samia Mora Gutierrez. The fifth victim was a 59-year-old chaperon called Nathaniel Kong. The office however did not provide any additional details. Investigators are trying to piece together the father's motive and how he obtained the weapon. Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District Capt. Parker Wilbourn told CNN that no one else in the church in the Arden-Arcade area at the time of the shooting was shot at. "Most were employees and no one else at the scene required medical help," he said. CNN reported that it was not clear whether a service or event was ongoing at the church at the time. California Governor Gavin Newsom described the shooting as "another senseless act of gun violence in America." "Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and their communities," he tweeted.
