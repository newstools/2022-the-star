Doctors union, Nyamira branch, has threatened to down stools over various unaddressed issues. In a statement on Monday, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union officials led by Aggrey Nyabuti, Steve Onyango and Lydia Kemunto said the county government should honour its promises to medics. “The county has been playing hide and seek in handling the doctors' welfare. That is why we have resolved to address some issues that require attention,” they said in a statement. On promotions, they said the county has refused to honour the return to work formula it signed with them on January 26, 2021. This was to ensure some of the doctors who were in the entry-level and other job groups for more than eight years were promoted as per the 2016 doctors' scheme of service. They are also concerned about the illegal demotions. Twenty one of their colleagues were demoted and re-designated to lower job groups in August, some beyond the service entry job group. “The process of correcting these demotions has taken so long and there is discrimination whereby those who have been reinstated have not had their arrears settled in full,” they said. “It is unfortunate that senior officers who have served for over 15 years have been demoted to the internship job groups.” Other issues are specialisation, where they said the county has not addressed the shortage of doctors. They said due to lack of motivation and poor working conditions, some specialists have opted to resign or seek transfers. The county government through Health chief officer Jack Magara is yet to respond to the grievances by the doctors. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
