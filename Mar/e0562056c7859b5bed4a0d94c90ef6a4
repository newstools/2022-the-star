Safina Party leader Senior Counsel Paul Muite has said the third liberation for the country will be about the economy and the social life of Kenyans. Addressing over 2,000 delegates of the party during its NDC on Monday at the Bomas of Kenya, Muite said his party shares similar agenda for the country with that of Deputy President William Ruto. The NDC was convened to endorse businessman Jimi Wanjigi for the presidency. “For those of you who are wondering why Safina is aligned economically, socially with UDA, it is because the vision that UDA has for this country is identical to that of Safina. That is as far as social, economy and policy are concerned,” Muite said. He pledged to incorporate Ruto's UDA in their next government in the event Wanjigi wins the presidency. “Na kwa maana ya Mungu ni mengi, mkishinda pia mtualike,” Muite said. This loosely translates to: "Because God’s plans are many, if you also win, do invite us also to your government". Ruto and some of his Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders attended the Safina event, including former Bomet governor Isaac Ruto. The businessman ditched ODM and joined Safina two weeks ago. Wanjigi had earlier stated that he has not given up on being Kenya’s next president and he will do that under the Safina party. "I did assure Kenyans that I will be on the ballot on August 9. And where I will be, it is where the next government will be formed. It will be a government of the people of Kenya and for the people of Kenya. Today, I have officially become a member of Safina Party," Wanjigi said. Wanjigi claimed that his exit from the ODM party was due to the violence subjected to him during the party’s NDC at Kasarani stadium. "I resigned from ODM after the brutal violence I experienced at Kasarani during the ODM National Delegates Conference. Hon. Raila made it practically impossible for the Party to hold free, democratic, and credible Presidential nominations," he said.
