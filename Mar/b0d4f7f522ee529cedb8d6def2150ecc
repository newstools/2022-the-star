Multiple 2WD Champion Leo Varese is leaving nothing to chance ahead of KNRC Nakuru Rally which starts at Mogotio Cultural Centre on Saturday. With 84 starts (most by any partnership in 2WD) alongside Kigo Kareithi, Sportpesa Rally team driver said he feels motivated heading to Nakuru following his 22nd career win in Il-Bisil during the season-opening Kenya Motor Sports Club Rally. His round one win in Il-Bisil is his fourth in the KMSC round after victories in 2008,2014 and 2017. “We are now leading the Two Wheel Drive Championship and the essence going forward is to take as many points as possible. Kajiado has always been a favourable hunting ground. Let’s see how it goes in Mogotio,” said Leo. “Now I am getting a good feeling with the car and hopefully I will run most of the events. The initial plan was to do five but after the win in Kajiado, the plan is to run a full season, God willing.” “I fine-tune the Auris every now and then and things seem to be getting better — especially in Il-Bisil stages, where I felt I had more reliability. We needed to really fight and there is nothing good than overtaking a 4WD when we saw Kush Patel kind of stuck in the last stage. I tried to push to fight with my two-wheel drive adversaries, so fingers crossed.” Leo is the most successful two-wheel drive competitor in recent memory. He has won Mombasa, RSC and Guru Nanak rounds twice, Nanyuki thrice and Eldoret once. “It was a great feeling winning in Kajiado last month and as such, it’s an honour increasing our stats on clubs’ Roll of Honors,” he said.
