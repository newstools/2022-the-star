Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has said Deputy President William Ruto’s rigging claims is an indicator that he has sensed defeat in August 9, polls. Osotsi was speaking on Saturday at Masane church in Maragoli South,Vihiga county. He said ODM leader Raila Odinga will be the next president and Kenyans will confirm that on the ballot. Osotsi said Ruto may be planning to use the rigging claims to cause chaos in the country and urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission boss Wafula Chebukati to summon him over the claims. “Chebukati must deal with Ruto the same way he dealt with Muranga Woman Rep Sabina Chege on the issue of rigging claims,” Osotsi said. “Let him explain what he knows because we want fair and creidble elections for all." The lawmaker challenged Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza alliance to avoid side shows and focus on seeking for votes from Kenyans. He said in Azimio la Umoja, they are well prepared and from their countrywide rallies they believe Kenyans will vote for Azimio la Umoja movement. “Raila is the only hope we have to restore our economy, democracy and unite Kenyans compared to the Kenya Kwanza that has no agenda for this nation,” he said. He urged residents to elect him as their senator, promising to fight for allocation of more resources for development. “If you elect me and a governor under Azimio we shall push more resources to be allocated to the county,” he said.
