Health CS Mutahi Kagwe has assured Kenyans that the country is now well equipped to treat and manage cancer. He said that the country has established world-class infrastructure to better deal with the disease. He said many patients are opting to be treated locally instead of going abroad, especially in India as it has been the norm. Kagwe told a Senate committee on health on Thursday that 200 cancer patients who would have travelled to India for treatment have successfully received their treatment in the country since January this year. "If there is an area we can be proud of as a country, it is the area of cancer in terms of what we have begun to do," he said. The government is partnering with other foreign governments, state and non-state actors to equip health providers with the skills that will help manage cancer pain. The Health Ministry aims to develop a strategic plan on cancer management in the country by the end of April. It has also put in place plans to redesign the health professionals' curriculum to respond to technological advancements and changing health care needs. According to Kagwe, the government has identified priority areas based on the country's cancer burden and developed targeting interventions to deal with emerging challenges. Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that there are 40,000 cancer diagnoses annually and 20,000 of them die due to late detection and lack of treatment. Cancer is the third leading cause of death in Kenya after infectious and cardiovascular diseases. The Health Cabinet Secretary assured Kenyans that the country is now in a better position to deal with the disease.
