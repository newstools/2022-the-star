Police have arrested over 200 riders in Nairobi CBD as a crackdown on the sector intensifies following the sexual assault of female motorists along Wangari Maathai road. Police IG Hillary Mutyambai announced this on Tuesday. Mutyambai said the operation against the bodaboda riders will continue to ensure sanity in the sector. “We will not stop in this drive. We will ensure sanity reigns,” he said. The riders include the 16 who were identified in the sexual assault and robbery with violence case on Friday, March 4. More than 80 had on Tuesday been presented in court at Milimani as police planned to charge them with various offences. Officials said they expected to arrest more suspects. Earlier, Police Spokesperson Bruno Shioso had said only 32 riders had been arrested over the assault. The men were Tuesday expected in court where police planned to make a miscellaneous application to detain them as they investigate claims of sexual assault and robbery with violence. The incident happened on the Wangari Maathai road on Friday but the matter came to the limelight on Monday after the video was widely circulated on social media. In her statement at Parklands police station, the lady told police that a boda boda rider blocked her car abruptly and she crashed into the motorbike. The rider fell to the ground and broke a leg. She stopped a few metres from the scene but was mobbed by a group of riders, some of whom tried to rob her. She got alarmed and drove off. The riders chased after her for a few kilometres and blocked her car. They then yanked open her car door and the woman screamed for help. One of the riders, all this while, was recording the happenings. She lost money and other valuables in the melee. She was saved by traffic police who were alerted by other motorists who had witnessed the drama.
