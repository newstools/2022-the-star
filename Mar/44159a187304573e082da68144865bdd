Deputy President William Ruto is expected to arrive in London on Sunday. "Deputy President and his delegation will arrive in London later today for the second leg of his international trip," Director of Communications Hussein Mohammed said. The Deputy President and his entourage left the country last Sunday for the United States and UK. His head of International Relations Ababu Namwamba said Ruto is “honouring invites by senior government officials and top policy institutes in Washington DC and London.” In London, Ruto is set to meet senior government officials, visit the National Counter Terrorism Centre and speak at the Commonwealth Secretariat and Royal Institute of International Affairs – popularly known as Chatham House. “He will also engage the Kenyan diaspora in the UK and pay a courtesy call on the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby,” Namwamba said in the February 24 statement. DP’s scheduled tour is coming hot in the heels of a scaled up political onslaught by his ally-turned-archrival President Uhuru Kenyatta. The latter now backs ODM leader Raila Odinga who was his competitor in the 2013 and 2017 presidential election – all that the opposition disputed. President Kenyatta has declared support for Raila, and has on two successive occasions, at Sagana III and at Jubilee Party National Delegates Conference, where he made it clear Ruto is unfit to lead the country.
