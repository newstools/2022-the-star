Nairobi City Stars forward Nicholas Kipchabet Kipkirui is targeting an improved show after coming through a recent injury that slowed down his optimal performance. Kipkirui suffered an ankle sprain against AFC Leopards in the first game of the year at Nyayo National Stadium. He limped off that game with six minutes left and had to sit out for a full month, missing four games against Talanta, Tusker, and back-to-back games against Kakamega Homeboyz. In November and December last year, Kipkirui sat out games against Vihiga Bullets, Karibangi Sharks, and KCB due to injury and sickness. Beyond the injuries and sickness that kept him out of six games, Kipkirui acknowledges that City Stars’ consistency this season is due to the culture of teamwork. “Though I have not met my expectation, I am looking forward be at my best once again given the chance. But I am happy to have recovered well from the injury that had worried me a lot,” said Kipkirui He added: “The team has carried themselves well and have done their best and all this is due to teamwork. If we continue like this as a team, we are destined for greatness. The season is going on well and our main focus is to be the champions.” At the same time, speedy winger Rodgers Okuse Okumu, arguably Kenya Premier League’s quickest player off the blocks, reckons that Nairobi City Stars’ fine run this season is due to a competitive squad. Okuse, roped in from Coast Stima in the offseason of the year 2020, shares his analysis at a time when Simba Wa Nairobi are second on the log with 35 points after 20 rounds of play into the 2021/22 FKF Premier League season. “I must say the season has gone on well and we as City Stars have had a good run. This is due to competitiveness in the squad which is the real reason why the team has picked up positive results,” said the winger.  He added: “We firmly believe that this is our season but we have to step it up a bit more to be able to achieve the set targets as a team.”  ENDS
