Raphael Tuju has officially handed over the Jubilee Party secretary-general office to his successor Jeremiah Kioni. The ceremony took place on Friday at the Jubilee Party headquarters in Pangani, Nairobi. Ndaragwa MP will now be in charge of the party's affairs as it plans to roar back to the political arena ahead of the August 9 election. The changes to the party leadership were made last month during the National delegates Congress that was held at the KICC. During the NDC meeting, President Uhuru Kenyatta was retained as the party leader for the next five years. Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi, Katobu Ngatobu, Naomi Shaban, and Peter Mositet were appointed deputy party leaders. David Murathe's position of deputy vice-chairman was retained and will be under Nelson Nzuya. Kieni MP Kanini Kega was also picked as the Jubilee party director of elections. The party has so far announced that it will be backing the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the presidential bid under the Azimio la Umoja Movement. The president had endorsed Raila and said that his party will work closely with the Azimio to form the next government. Before the JP changes were announced, Tuju had resigned from his position, saying that he will now be seeking to venture into elective position. While making his address, the president asked Tuju to consider remaining at the party’s NEC. He also asked Raila to take of him, referring him as a man who loves his country. “This man Tuju loves his country. Please I hand him over to you ODM on whatever he is looking for. He is our man and don't frustrate him," Uhuru said, asking Tuju to consider remaining at the Jubilee NEC.
