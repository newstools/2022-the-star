The Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi has called upon politicians not to cause conflict among Kenyans and instead preach peace for the sake of the country's unity. He pleaded with those competing for elective positions, especially the presidency, to ensure that the country stays united even after the August 9 general election. "Please let us preach peace because after August 9 there will still be a country called Kenya so that our children may inherit a peaceful country,"Muturi said. The presidential aspirant on a Democratic Party  (DP) ticket, while addressing congregants at ACK St. James Cathedral church in Kiambu town, said he has been calling upon his competitors not to corrupt the minds of Kenyans in their quest to ascend to leadership. "As leaders we should avoid mudslinging each other in public because the moment we decide to come together our supporters continue to think we are enemies and go for each other's necks when in the real sense we are not enemies," the Speaker said. "Whatever your political differences it must not play out in our public meetings. We must be guided by decorum."he added. Muturi said in his campaigns he wants a country that is guided by order, integrity and respect for one another. He noted that it does not matter who becomes the president as the country shall be guided by democratic principles. "It really doesn't matter whether you are tall, short, fat, thin, brown or dark. All that matters is the number of votes one gets and we should all accept whoever wins," Referring to the vote-rich Mt  Kenya region, he pleaded with residents and leaders to guard against being divided along political affiliations on account of the huge number of votes which makes it attractive to those seeking the presidency. "I have been in the forefront preaching peace in this region and enlightening the votes so the voters so that they don't fall prey to lies,"Muturi said. (Edited by Francis Wadegu)
