It will be a rematch of the 2017 race for the Lurambi parliamentary seat on August 9. Renowned corrective surgeon Prof Stanley Khainga will once again face off with incumbent Titus Khamala. This time, the two have swapped parties in a tough race pitting Azimio La Umoja and Kenya Kwanza. In 2017, Khamala, who vied on the ANC ticket, defeated Khainga who stood on ODM ticket. They were both in the now-defunct Nasa. Khamala, however, defected from ANC last month to join Raila Odinga-led ODM under the Azimio La Umoja Movement. He has vowed to recapture the seat on ODM, while Khainga said he is confident he will win. Kakamega is the cradle of Luhya politics and its control is critical for those seeking national leadership. This in turn makes the race for Lurambi, which hosts Kakamega town and the Kakamega county headquarters, competitive. Other aspirants include Timothy Vikiru, who will be running on the Maendeleo Development Party ticket, and former MP Manyala Keya and Butsotso South MCA Walter Andati, who are seeking the UDA ticket. No female aspirant has shown interest yet. Since Independence, Lurambi has never been represented by a woman MP. MPs elected in Lurambi constituency have traditionally served one term and changed, except for the late Dr Newton Kulundu, who served two terms between 1997-02 and 2002-07. The larger Lurambi constituency gave birth to Likuyani, Lugari, Malava and Navakholo constituencies. Edited by A.N
