IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said they will provide a portal for the media to access election results in real-time. According to Chebukati, the move would enhance transparency, accountability, and prevent disinformation and misinformation. He spoke in Nakuru when the commission signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Kenya Editors Guild and Kenya Union of Journalists on Friday. KEG and KUJ signed the MoU on behalf of the Kenya Media Sector Working Group. The aim of MoU was to ensure capacity building, enhance the delivery of factual, credible and verifiable information to the public, promote access to electoral activities at tallying centres and polling stations, provide resource persons on electoral law, processes and activities to inform the public. Chebukati further noted the media's role in the election process is critical and it acts as the watchdog. "The media points out breaches in the code of conduct from which IEBC acts upon," Chebukati said. He said IEBC also uses media reports as evidence to prosecute those who breach the code of conduct. "When the media needs clarity on any information on the electoral process, they should seek IEBC input," he said. IEBC vice-chairperson Juliana Cherera said that media is the voice and IEBC is the content, thus they will ensure the voice have the right content. IEBC commits itself to give access to electoral information and expects the media to be factual, ethical and professional in their reporting. "The partnership (media and IEBC) is key to enable IEBC to deliver a free, fair and credible election," she said.
