Vihiga clinical officers on internship program have down their tools seeking payment from the national government. The officers who were deployed across the county and sub-county hospitals say they have not been paid for seven months. Led by Roy Kevin who is their chairman, the officers staged a demonstration in Mbale town on Wednesday afternoon as they sought an audience from the Ministry of Health officials. While addressing the press in Mbale town, they said they are yet to understand why the Health Ministry is taking longer to pay them despite the government allocating the money in the budget. “We can’t tell why the ministry is taking that long. We have other things to sort including rent, food, transport and our personal needs,” Kevin said. Vihiga referral Medical superintend Vitalis  Juma said the interns have been out of duty since Monday demanding their pay. The officers have been serving on a one-year contract and are fearful that with the election approaching, they may not be paid. “We have kept silent for long. That is why we are joining our colleagues in the whole nation to raise our concerns about our pay,” said Kevin. The project by the national government to employ the interns was aimed at giving them experience. They said it is inhuman to be subjected to unpaid internships for almost a year without considering how they cater for their basic needs.
