Nakuru county has in recent elections cemented its place as the melting pot of Kenya's national politics. It is the launchpad of political movements. After announcing their deal to work together, Deputy President William Ruto and his new-found ally Musalia Mudavadi of ANC rallied their troops to Nakuru for their first-ever rally together ahead of the August 9, 2022 general election. It cannot be forgotten that  Raila Odinga's Azimio La Umoja Movement was also launched in Nakuru in September last year. And while Nakuru has gained its significance as the bedrock of Kenya's politics, Nairobi, the capital city, remains a crucial swing-vote region where all rallies are concluded. All political formations often hold their last rallies in the capital. With just five months to the polls, top presidential candidates are angling for a chunk of the city's over two million votes. Top presidential contenders are seeking allies to win the crucial vote block. Ruto's alliance with Mudavadi is seen as a strategy to win over the Luhya vote basket in Nairobi. ODM's Raila has traditionally won the presidential votes in the capital and he will be hoping to better that score when Kenyans cast their ballot on August 9. A look at Nairobi's voting pattern in previous years shows it has often tilted in favour of the opposition. In the 2017 presidential election results, Opposition chief Raila garnered 828,826 votes against the ruling Jubilee’s candidate President Uhuru Kenyatta who got 791,291 votes. The total number of votes stood at 2,251,929 in 2017. That is expected to increase when the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission adds to its roll, newly registered voters. In the 2013 election, Raila defeated Uhuru after winning 49 per cent of the city's votes against 46.75 for the President. It is worth noting that both Uhuru and Raila are going into the 2022 election as a team with the President backing the candidature of the ODM leader as his successor. That combination is likely to complicate Ruto's arithmetic in winning seats in the capital. Nairobi has 17 constituencies with 85 electoral wards. The 2019 Population and Housing Census said the capital had 4,397,073 million residents. In the 2017 general election, Uhuru's Jubilee party won nine of the 17 MP seats with Raila's ODM winning seven. Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper party won one MP's seat. Jubilee clinched the seat of senator while ODM won that of the Woman Representative. In terms of wards, it was almost even with Jubilee winning 43 MCA seats against ODM's 41. One candidate was elected as an independent.  Breakdown 1. Mathare Mathare constituency was carved out of Starehe for the 2013 general election when TNA party's George Wanjohi became its first MP.
