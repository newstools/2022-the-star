The National Council of Churches in Kenya has advised the clergy against anointing political aspirants. NCCK has also asked it's members too continue barring politicians from addressing congregants at the pulpit. However, NCCK secretary general Rev Chris Kinyanjui yesterday asked churches to receive donations given by politicians and aspirants. "Churches can receive donations and contributions from all worshipers, including politicians and aspirants," he said. "However, these contributions should not be used as campaign forums and churches should avoid announcing what a particular individual has given," he said. Kinyajui spoke at Jumuiya Conference and Country Home in Kabuku, Limuru subcounty, on Thursday. He spoke one week after President Uhuru Kenyatta said some church leaders were receiving corruption money from politicians. NCCK further asked the politicians to continue attending church and they can speak to the congregants after the service since they are seeking for votes. The clergy urged Kenyatta to hold the country together and preach peace as the campaign period gathers pace. NCCK also asked Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to strengthen security and ensure no once attacked because of their political affiliation. Kinyanjui asked the Treasury to fund the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to enable them prepare for the elections. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
