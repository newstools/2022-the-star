Kenyans will from this week receive an alert before being enrolled on a political party. This is one of the bold steps the office of Registrar of Political Parties is undertaking to lockout political parties from listing Kenyans to their outfits without seeking consent. Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu on Thursday told a parliamentary committee that Kenyans will receive a message on their phone before any changes on their party membership status is effected. "This week if a record is changed, an SMS comes to your phone to confirm or decline the change of membership," Nderitu told National Assembly's Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. She said the new system is ready and is being rolled out from this week. The move is a relief to Kenyans who have been finding themselves registered in political parties without their consent.
