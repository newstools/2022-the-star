Bomet county cannot explain why a stadium whose construction started in 2015 has stalled despite the millions pumped into it. A Senate committee inspected the project on Monday and demanded answers. Senator Ochilo Ayacko, who chairs the Senate Public Accounts and Investment Committee, said it is sad that the county cannot even tell how much has been spent on the project. Addressing the press, he said they could not take the explanation by Deputy Governor Shadrack Rotich, who represented the governor, lightly. The project has gobbled up Sh250 million since it was initiated by former governor Isaac Rutto. It was to be completed in a year. County officials said the project stalled following a land tussle with Bomet University, which claims part of the land. Ayacko said the public does not use the project thus value for money was yet to be realised. He said the committee will get the answers it seeks. “We will make sure that Governor Hillary Barchok appears before the Senate in Nairobi to explain why this multimillion-shilling project stalled and when it will be completed,” Ayacko said. There has been no progress on the project since 2020. Local football teams have been using the stadium, with its incomplete terraces and perimeter wall. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
