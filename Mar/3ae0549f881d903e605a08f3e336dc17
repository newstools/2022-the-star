Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) will start 3 on 3 trials this weekend ahead of the 2022 Commonwealth Games. KBF secretary Ambrose Kisoi said a two-day preliminary round of the trials will start at the branch level on Saturday. Then, he revealed, a final round will be held a week later in Nairobi where a team to Birmingham will be named. “Each branch will select the top 20 men and women in both the U23 and senior categories for the final rounds,” Kisoi said. Nairobi will have eight men and eight women in both categories. “This will ensure equal opportunity for everyone interested,” he added. Meanwhile, Strathmore University Blades coach Tony Ochieng is wary of Ulinzi Warriors’ strength at the backcourt ahead of their playoff semifinal encounter at Nyayo Stadium this weekend. “I am worried about their guards. They are very experienced, athletic and strong. This is one area I think they have an edge. But we will be prepared for them,” Ochieng said. “In terms of personnel experience, they have an edge but we are also peaking at the right time and I am encouraged by our performance inthe quarters against Thunder (who they beat 2-0 (61-53 and68-39).” The other men’s game pits Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), who dispatched Eldonet Platinum 2-0 ( 87-53 and 86-66 ), against Equity Bank.
