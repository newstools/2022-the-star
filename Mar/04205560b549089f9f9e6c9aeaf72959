Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi has turned down efforts by some leaders and residents, to vie for the Bungoma Senator position. He will instead defend his seat. Wamunyinyi said the Democratic Action Party of Kenya will field strong candidates to face the current Senator Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. “We will field candidates in all positions except the presidential bid, we support ODM leader Raila Odinga,” the MP said. The DAP-K leader spoke at Posta ground in Bungoma on Tuesday. Wamunyinyi said after consulting political pundits and elders from Kanduyi, he decided to shelve his senator bid. “Kanduyi constituency belongs to the people, they understand me better and have agreed I continue serving them in the same capacity,” he said. “There is no law that says a party leader should not be an MP, I will retain my seat as the DAP-K leader, nothing will stop me. I am already a national leader.” The lawmaker mentioned former UNCTAD secretary general Mukhisa Kituyi and former Kanduyi MP Lawrence Sifuna, as possible Azimio's Bungoma senatorial aspirants. He said they will pick one of them to face Wetang'ula in the August polls. Wamunyinyi said he was ready to face former Internal security minister Alfred Khang'ati at the nomination stage for the Kanduyi MP. Khang'ati was elected in 2007 on ODM and unsuccessfully vied twice for the Bungoma gubernatorial seat in 2013 and 2017. “It is his democratic right to vie for any seat, we in DAP-K believe in democracy and am ready to face him. The winner will fight to win the parliamentary seat,” Wamunyinyi said. If Wamunyinyi wins in the nomination stage, he will face former Bungoma county assembly speaker John Makali, Nairobi businessman Wafula Wambanda, politician Wafula Wakoli and Bungoma-based businessman Mulunda Khaoya.
