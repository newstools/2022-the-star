Deputy President William Ruto’s visit to the US was the main subject of the day on Thursday and Friday, his visit to the White House triggering varying reactions from Kenyans in the social media. The DP and some of his Kenya Kwanza Alliance delegates are currently in the US to engage with the officials. According to the DP’s Presidential Campaign Director of Communication Hussein Mohamed who is part of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance delegations in the US, the team was hosted at the White House in Washington DC, in a closed-door meeting where issues of strategic partnership between US, and Kenya were discussed. “Kenya’s Deputy President Dr. William Ruto & former Vice President Musalia Mudavadi led a delegation that was hosted at the White House in Washington DC today, in a closed-door meeting where issues of strategic partnership between U.S.A & Kenya were discussed,” Hussein tweeted. However, some Kenyans who were anxious to see some photos taken during the meeting doubted the move, hence, generating propaganda. A photo of US President Joe Biden that had been edited to include the DP was being circulated, which the fact-checker has verified to be fake. By the end of Friday, none of the delegates who accompanied him shared a photo of them in the meeting, not even his communication director. Even so, Biden, who is active in his official Twitter account had not posted the photo, leave alone the White House. In any case, the DP would have also shared the photo through his social media accounts. Also, the image verification tools have not detected the same image, but the TinEye indicated one of the similar images posted by the Daily Mail as Biden issued his comment on the Russian invasion.
