Jumia consumers will enjoy a 50 per cent discount on diverse cuisines from across the country during the Jumia Food Festival Campaign. The campaign which will take place from March 1 to March 13 is organized in partnership with local restaurants like Nyama Mama, Malindi Dishes, and Agulu Lounge as well as Blue Chip International Restaurant chains such as KFC, Java, Artcaffe, BurgerKing, and Pizza Inn. Jumia Kenya CEO Betty Mwangi said with more popular food vendors and increased mobile and internet penetration in the country, customers are now more than ever tapping into online shopping platforms such as Jumia Food to save time and money. "We are happy to partner with restaurants like Mombasa Swahili dishes, Pwani dishes in Dala, Kisumu, Chicken Baristo in Nakuru, Blue Lounge restaurant in Eldoret, and many more to bring our customers their favourite delicacies to their doorstep,” Mwangi said. Customers who will participate in the Food Festival campaign will get deals from hundreds of restaurants and also benefit from free delivery options from supermarkets, and water and gas cylinder refill services. “Consumers will also enjoy free delivery during the Food Festival campaign, and most important is that Jumia Food will continue to support businesses in the ecosystem,” Betty added. The company aims to also expand its vendor network for Jumia Food to meet the increasing demand from customers. Last year, Jumia Food doubled its presence in Kisumu, Nakuru, Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, and Kiambu.
