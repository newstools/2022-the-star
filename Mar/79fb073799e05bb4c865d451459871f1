Nothing slurps like a cold apple cider margarita on a hot sunny afternoon. Margaritas are popular because in addition to sweet and sour flavours, they include salt. A margarita is a Mexican and American drink that dates back to the 1930s. Ingredients Instructions Step 1 Mix equal parts of cinnamon, sugar and sea salt. Run a lime wedge around the rim of the glass and coat in sugar. Rim your glass in salted cinnamon sugar as desired. Step 2 Combine the tequila, orange liquor, apple cider, lime juice and maple in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake to combine for 4 minutes. Step 3 Strain into the glass. Garnish with apple slices, rosemary, and cinnamon sticks. Enjoy with friends and family.
