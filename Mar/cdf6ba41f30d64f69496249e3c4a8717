The Magical Kenya Open sponsorship portfolio continues to burgeon as both local and international partners continue to trickle in. The event has seen the entry of Swiss multinational food and drinks processing company Nestlé, which has joined the fray as the official hot beverage partner in a deal worth Sh3m. The sponsorship deal will ensure fans have their thirst for hot beverages quenched for the duration of the European Tour tournament, at no charge. Also to join the sponsors are Crown Paints, who have donated Sh2 million, which will go towards upgrading the Muthaiga golf course. The tournament tees off on Thursday and runs through Sunday when the winner will be crowned. With a prize purse of Sh227.5 million, the 2022 Magical Kenya Open has drawn over 150 golfers from Kenya and around the world, including eight Kenyan professionals, six Kenyan amateurs, and two regional players. Muthaiga Golf Club Chairman, Ronald Meru, said the tournament will give amateurs a chance to play with professionals and at the same time offer fans wholesome entertainment. “We’ve also made elaborate plans by setting up a village which will be activated by Kenya Open Golf Limited and sponsors to ensure golf fans and their families are well entertained by various local and international artists who will perform at the event,” said Meru.
