Growing up, we knew digestive biscuits as the healthier alternative to normal biscuits, but it is true. This is because they contain a high amount of fiber. Many health enthusiasts claim that digestive biscuits can improve digestion and can help maintain the blood sugar levels. Although digestive biscuits are a healthy alternative, moderation is key. The malt extract is what gives them the crispiness, texture and taste. Although, moderation is key since it might cause flatulence if consumed in excess. Rich in fiber, digestive biscuits can help reduce hunger pangs, keeping you fuller than normal biscuits. The fiber in the biscuits helps promote a healthy digestive system by relieving constipation and aid in digestion. They contain fewer calories compared to normal biscuits since they are made using whole wheat flour, which is better than white or processed flour.
