Kisii Sports Club has lined up several tournaments after rehabilitating the golf course. Club chairman, Wycliffe Ayienda and captain Jared Mogeni, said the club management will seek to make the course one of the best in the country. Ayienda said: “We have been working on the course and I’m happy to announce that it’s in very good condition now and we shall continue improving it. This month, we have three more tournaments to play.” The chairman further announced plans to reciprocate with more clubs across the country. “We are not reciprocating with most clubs because the club deteriorated but we have improved infrastructure,” he added. Ayienda spoke at the club on Sunday evening after the Sunday Spoon Gold tournament which attracted 37 golfers and 10 junior golfers. He said the club is in the process of recruiting women and junior golfers. So far, 17 ladies have been recruited. “We have the highest number of registered junior golfers in this region. The club has engaged the services of Charles Aburi who is a certified trainer to take charge of the junior programme. The junior golfers will now be participating in regional and national events,” Ayienda revealed. During the Sunday spoon golf tournament, veteran golfer Christopher Maato emerged overall with 67 points net and was followed by Joseph Ogweche with 67 points. Maato beat Ogweche on countback to win the event with John Omanwa third on 71 points. Liz Mose won the ladies category with 73 points net and was trailed in second place by Olga Otari with 80 points same as third-placed Lydia Momanyi.
