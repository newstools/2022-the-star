Local pros have every reason to smile after Kenya Vision 2030 announced their sponsorship package ahead of today’s Magical Kenya Open. Kenya Vision 2030 Director-General, Kenneth Mwige, gave local and regional pros each a token of Sh200,000 to serve as logistical support for the event which will count towards the DP World Tour. All the benefits exclude the four golfers under Absa Bank Kenya stable namely Daniel Nduva, Simon Ngige, David Wakhu, and Mohit  Mediratta. Those who have benefited from the Vision 2030 boost are Dismas Indiza, Paul Chidale of Malawi, Zimbabwean Robson Chinhoi, Eric Ooko, and Samuel Njoroge. Each of the pros who qualified for the Kenya Open got Sh200,000 facilitation. Among those being sponsored by Vision 2030 are Dismas Indiza (Mumias GC), Erick Ooko (Golf Park), Jastas Madoya (Great Rift Valley Golf Lodge Resort), Ronald Rumayo (Uganda), and Samuel Njoroge (Railways). Mwige said a further Sh1 million will be shared by top three ranked Kenyan players and top three ranked African players at the end of the tournament. A further Sh1 million will also be shared by those players who make the cut on Friday. “The Kenya Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat is sponsoring Kenyan professional golf players, two regional and four amateurs and two junior players who will participate in the Magical Kenya Open. The sponsorship will be for the direct logistical support to the players participating in this week’s event at the Muthaiga. As part of the promotion of the Kenyan brand, the Kenya Vision 2030 logo will appear on the golf T-shirts and golf caps for the Players who have been sponsored by the Vision 2030 Delivery Secretariat. This will be key in boosting their morale for the event,” he said.
