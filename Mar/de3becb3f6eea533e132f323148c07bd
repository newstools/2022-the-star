Vihiga Queens will look to extend their five-point lead at the top of the Kenya Women's Premier League when they host Bunyore Starlets at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. The three-time champions are in blistering form with seven wins and a draw from eight matches to amass 22 points. The Cecafa club champions ripped Wadadia apart last weekend after buttering the Mumias-based side 8-1 to remain on course for a fourth title in five years. Bunyore, on the other hand, are seventh with 12 points and remain winless on the road. Vihiga welcome back Tereza Engesha who missed the win against Wadadia. Meanwhile, giant-killers Bunyore will be without Shalyne Onjote, Juliana Kaupe and Dedra Moshe due to injuries but Daniel Arunga's still have the credentials to test Vihiga's title ambitions. Second-placed Gaspo visit Trans-Nzoia Falcons at ASK Grounds, Kitale. Gatundu-based Gaspo have lost once and their 1-1 draws with both Ulinzi and Vihiga give them hope of a better performance. Gaspo are lethal in attack and could leave Kitale with three points should the team step on their gas pedal. However, Falcons can match any opposition on their day and with internationals Martha Amunyolete and Violet Wanyonyi in their ranks, they will be a handful for Gaspo's defence. Defending champions Thika Queens, who have recovered from an early-season blip, welcome an unconvincing Wadadia side at Thika Stadium. Super Cup holders Ulinzi Starlets entertain a technically gifted Zetech Sparks team at Ruaraka. The two sides are separated by two points at fifth and sixth respectively. On the other side of the table Kisumu (11th) tackle 10th-placed Kayole Starlets at Moi Stadium, Kisumu while bottom side Kangemi Ladies will look to win their second match of the season when they settle scores with Nakuru City Queens at Ligi Ndogo grounds.
