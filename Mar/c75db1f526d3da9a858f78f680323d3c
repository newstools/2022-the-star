Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said that he is ready to work with ODM leader Raila Odinga again. The Wiper leader stirred the political scene, insisting he now wants Raila to honour a 2017 pre-election deal with him. Speaking on Tuesday at the Kalonzo Musyoka Command Centre, Kalonzo said that this time, however, negotiations must be structured. "As we begin the fresh round of political negotiation in our country, I have been compelled to release this document due to the often said statement that I am an indecisive kingmaker and that I would be a fool to support Raila Odinga for the third time," he said. He accused Raila of failing to honour their 2017 coalition agreement under the National Super Alliance (Nasa). The agreement was signed on April 30, 2017. Kalonzo also dispelled reports that there is tension between him and ODM leader Raila Odinga. 'There is no tension between me and my brother Raila Odinga," he said. The former vice president said he is willing to reunite with Raila but on condition that he agrees to commit to the document they secretly signed in the lead up to the 2017 polls. At the same time, Kalonzo said President Uhuru Kenyatta should lead the talks between him and Raila. "He (Uhuru) has a sense of authority and he is a sitting president and holds great sway," he said. "This was a secret agreement but the person who was to release it is already in breach of it." The wiper boss claimed that US-based lawyer Makau Mutua, who he claimed to be the lawyer who witnessed the signing, has refused to call a meeting between him and Raila to look at the 2017 coalition agreement. "I have tried in vain to have Makau Mutua call a meeting with Raila," he said. Kalonzo said Raila has the option of binding with this life binding document to emerge as a national and continental democratic hero or he doesn't and will compound the trust deficit." Edited by M.
