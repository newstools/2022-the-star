Broke National Super League side Shabana FC will conduct a funds drive tomorrow to help the club honour the remaining matches of the season. Shabana have been struggling financially due to a lack of sponsorship and their problems have been compounded by playing their home matches at Awendo in Migori County. The upgrading of Gusii Stadium has stalled and this has forced the cash-strapped side to use Awendo, which is 45km away thus denying them the much-needed revenue and home support. The club has been relying on the management led by president Jared Nivaton and fans for survival. According to secretary Elzaphan Kerama, the funds' drive will be held at Public Service Club in Upper Hill, Nairobi. “We are reaching out to our leaders and supporters to attend the event and support the team,” said Kerama. The club is third on the log with 31 points, two behind second-placed Fortune Sacco and five behind log leaders Administration Police Service Bomet. Shabana will host Mully Children’s Family (MCF) at Awendo as the second leg resumes. Shabana coach Sammy Okoth remains unbeaten in six games in charge. Since taking over, Shabana have won four games and drawn two. Okoth has, however, cautioned fans not to put a lot of pressure on the team. “I know the management and fans want the team promoted but I’m appealing for patience,” he noted. He, however, admitted that qualifying for the Kenya Premier League is achievable this season. During a recent meeting with players, chairman Nyandoro Kambi challenged the players to eye promotion. “I believe this is our season. Don’t let us down,” said Kambi.
