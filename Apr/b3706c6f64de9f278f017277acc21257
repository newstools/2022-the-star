Meru County health workers have issued a strike notice. The strike will be held on Monday, April 25, owing to pending salaries. "Workers have agreed to hold a demonstration on Monday, April 25, if March salary will not have been paid." In a statement released on Wednesday, the union has lamented that the workers have almost two months pending pay. "Meru county workers have not received almost two months’ salary leading to unseen suffering. As a result, socio-economic spectrum has been compromised in various aspects," the union said. The union has advised the public to seek alternative ways to get health care. It added that the members will suspend all elective admissions at all health facilities in Meru County. This will include suspension of all elective surgeries, all non-emergency procedures, all outpatient clinics and all medical-legal duties( Post-mortems, P3 filling and court appearances). Also, there will be suspension of all first stage of labour admissions, all routine immunizations and all family planning services. It has added that they have no fees to take their children back to school come April 25. They have further said that banks are not willing to lend them money due to pending credits and their mobility to and from the workplace has been compromised. "Landlords are demanding house rents and several workers have been left without food on the table," the union added. The union added that a survey conducted by health workers' representatives has shown that all counties have paid all salaries except Meru County. Further, it added that casual workers are yet to be paid for almost six months now. "The workers have been left with only one option- to just join government inflated go-slow."
