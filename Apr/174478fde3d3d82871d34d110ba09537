Battle of the titans is expected in Kiambu county as Jubilee Party vows to win more seats in August polls. President Uhuru Kenyatta-led Jubilee is strategising on how to approach residents and ensure they get more support. Kiambu woman representative aspirant (Jubilee) Gladys Chania rubbished claims that the party feared losing to other parties, including to some independent aspirants. However, she urged residents to listen to the party leaders of all political parties, adding that residents are supposed to support the President's party. Chania asked residents not to cowed by how Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party conducted its primaries. “We are not scared at all. We have our own party. We already have strategies and still we are still researching as we approach residents to woo them to support us,” she said. She was speaking at Ngecha village in Limuru constituency on Saturday. Chania, who was the county organising secretary of The National Alliance party, said Jubilee has declared to use all its intelligence, wisdom and the best language in approaching residents. “We shall win with a big margin. I am sure we shall have majority of the MPs in the county, including the governor, Senate and the Woman Representative seats.” Chania will face off with Ann Wamuratha (UDA). Meanwhile Senator Kimani Wamatangi will battle it out for governor seat with the incumbent James Nyoro (Jubilee), former governor William Kabogo (Tujibebe Party) and Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (Chama cha Kazi party). Simon Wachira, a Jubilee supporter, asked residents to focus on the government projects initiated by some of the aspirants. Wachira said they have welcomed the move by Jubilee to support the Azimio whose presidential candidate is ODM leader Raila Odinga.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
