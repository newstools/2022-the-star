A female UDA MCA aspirant has been injured after she was attacked by goons during the ongoing party primaries in Mathare Constituency. Elizabeth Waithera, 39, was attacked by goons she claims belonged to one of her opponents at Kiboro primary school in Nairobi on Thursday. Waithera is among the candidates participating in the ongoing UDA primaries. She is contesting for Mlango Kubwa ward. They are four contestants eyeing the UDA party ticket. Waithera reported the incident at the Pangani police station. She said she had been denied access to the polling station and could not, therefore, cast her ballot. "I am an aspirant in Mlango Kubwa ward running for MCA and participating in the ongoing UDA nominations and I have been denied the right to vote," Waithera told the Star on Thursday. Waithera said she couldn't access the classrooms where the nomination exercise was ongoing at the school. "The goons belong to one of my opponents who is also participating in the primaries. They harassed me, tore my clothes and even assaulted me sexually, " Waithera said. "They haven't allowed me to vote even now. I have nobody to seek redress from since I don't even no the presiding officer at the polling station, " She said. Waithera said police officers manning the station had ignored her and watched as she was attacked and did nothing about it. She claimed the goons had taken over the polling station. Waithera called for justice. She wants relevant authorities to intervene so that she exercises her right to vote. She also wants the police to take action against her attackers and their sponsors. Waithera called on UDA's national elections board to take charge of the nominations and ensure free and fair nominations. She wants a security team from the region to offer protection to all aspirants.
