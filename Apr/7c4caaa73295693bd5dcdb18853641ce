The death toll from Covid-19 has for the fourth day running stayed at 5,649 after no death was reported over the last 24 hours. A statement released Sunday by Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, however, said that five more people tested positive for the virus from a sample size of 1,836 tested over the same period. This put the positivity rate at 0.3 per cent, one percentage point compared to Saturday's 0.2 per cent. From the cases, four patients are Kenyans while one is a foreigner. Four are males while one is a female, the youngest being 14 years old while the oldest is 50 years old. Kagwe said the total confirmed positive cases now stand at 323,614 while  cumulative tests conducted so far across the country are 3,566,917. "Today, no patient has recovered from the disease therefore the total recoveries remain 317,811 of whom 264,793 are from the Home-Based Care and Isolation program, while 53,018 are from various health facilities countrywide," Kagwe said. The CS further revealed that 11 patients are currently admitted in various health facilities across the country while 131 are under the Home-Based Isolation and Care program. He said none of the patients is in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or on supplemental oxygen or in the general wards and neither is any patient in the High Dependency Unit (HDU). On vaccination, Kagwe said 1,318 were administered over the last 24 hours, while the total number of people fully vaccinated over the same period 1,113. This now brings the proportion of adults fully vaccinated to 30.3 per cent. Overall, Kagwe said Kenya has to date administered 17,813,671 vaccines  across the country out of a target of 27,246,033 expected to be achieved by end of December. Out of this number, some 16,292,700 doses have been administered to the adult population (18 years and above) while 1,229,630 doses have been administered to those aged between 15 and 17 years. Another 291,341 vaccines are booster doses.
