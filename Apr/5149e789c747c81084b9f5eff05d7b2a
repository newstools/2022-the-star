Migori clergy are concerned over political intolerance and violence in the county, ahead of the ODM April 13 primaries. The clergy says there are reported cases already. “Migori has a poor image of chaos and violence caused by youths and politicians. We call for calmness,” Inter-religious Council of Kenya Migori secretary, Charles Otigo said. “Let politicians sell their policies without causing violence.” He said the party should condemn politicians causing chaos and protect voters. Otigo spoke in Migori town, Thursday, where he reacted to recent violence and flare-up of tension in rallies organised by ODM in Migori. Last Monday, supporters of Suna West MP Peter Masara and immediate former legislator Joseph Ndiege clashed at Migori Primary. The incident happened when Philip Mwabe was launching his governor bid. Masara was forced to leave the event midway after rowdy youths heckled him when Ndiege and his supporters arrived. Masara invited Ndiege to the podium with the supporters cheering, before turning against the incumbent whom they booed. At some point, Masara accused the gathering of making incessant noise because they did not understand English a move that did not go well with them. Last Friday, supporters of Migori Woman Representative Pamela Odhiambo and Migori Senator Ochilo Ayacko, both vying for governor seat, clashed at a rally at Posta grounds over attendance. Migori county commissioner Meru Mwangi said they had singled out 10 political gangs and their leaders for causing chaos. “We are using intelligence to closely monitor their moves since they have been fuelling violence in the past and have been keen in sharing information with leaders on venue,” he said. Mwangi said security had gathered enough intelligence after the county was listed among political violence hotspot counties by National Cohesion and Integration Commission.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
