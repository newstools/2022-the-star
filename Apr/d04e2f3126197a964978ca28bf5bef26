Ulinzi Starlets captain Diana Shakava believes early goals will be crucial if the soldiers hope to register maximum points against Bunyore Starlets at Mumboha grounds on Saturday in the Kenya Women’s Premier League match. Ulinzi have drawn their last two matches to fall out of the WPL title race that looks like Vihiga’s to lose but the utility player says they are focused on their own results. The Super Cup champions beat Bunyore 6-0 in the first leg but the newbies remain tough nuts to crack at home, losing just twice. “Mumboha is a tough ground to visit and we know exactly what to expect. Bunyore will be backed by their home fans but we need to be mentally strong. We need to score early goals and pile pressure on them,” Shakava revealed. “Right now we’re just focused on winning the remaining games.  It’s not over until it’s done and we can’t rely on how the other teams play against Vihiga,” she added. Gaspo Women and Trans-Nzoia Falcons are the only teams to escape Mumboha with maximum points. “It’s a must-win for us. The girls are motivated to bag three points in front of the fans,” Bunyore coach Daniel Arunga said. Vihiga are tipped to cruise past Kisumu All Starlets when they visit Moi Stadium, Kisumu. The Three-time former champions have opened a nine-point gap against second-placed Gaspo. Vihiga have 38 points while Gaspo boasts 29. Meanwhile, Zetech Sparks coach Benard Kitolo is taking their match against Gaspo this weekend at Stima seriously. On Sunday, Thika Queens host Nakuru City Queens while Falcons visit Wadadia at Mumias Sports Complex. A relegation battle involving 11th-placed Kayole against tail-enders Kangemi Ladies in the 12-team league will also be played at Stima.
