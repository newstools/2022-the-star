A Nairobi court has allowed detectives to continue detaining four men accused of stealing from passengers. The four; Stephen Otieno, Benson Odero, Harrison Nyamu, and Joshua Orengo were detained by Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa. The group had boarded a bus from Kisumu to Nairobi when they allegedly committed the offence. In his application, police constable James Kariuki told the court that the accused persons took advantage of passengers who had fallen asleep during the journey and stole from them. “A report was made to Kabete police station by the complainants who had boarded the bus that was heading to Nairobi from Kisumu. When they fell asleep, their valuables were stolen,” Kariuki told the court. He told the court that the driver of the bus drove to the Kabete police station and reported the matter after he was alerted of the matter by passengers. Kariuki revealed to the court that a search for the stolen valuables was done and the respondents were found in possession of some of the items. “The respondents are suspects in similar cases in different police stations. They were found in possession of some of the stolen items. We need time to do an identification parade to get more evidence,” he said. Kitagwa granted Kariuki his appeal to detain the four and directed that the suspects be held at the Kabete police station for seven days.
