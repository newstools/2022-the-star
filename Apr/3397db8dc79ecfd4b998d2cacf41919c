It now emerges that the late President Mwai Kibaki not only followed a strict diet due to doctor’s suggestion but also out of his own liking for specific foods. According to Nation, whenever he was at his retirement home in Mweiga, the former head of state did enjoy lamb chops and grilled meat from his favorite butcher called Joseph Maina. Maina's butchery called JJ Butchery tucked at the corner of Mweiga Town, Maina sold meat to Kibaki’s family and staff for the last 20 years. In the statehouse, Kibaki enjoyed Weetabix, croissants, tea, and a bowl of fruits for breakfast. He did not mind having chicken or fish for lunch and for greens, he loved broccoli and Mukimo. His love for grilled salmon, samosas, and muteta soup was impeccable. He enjoyed drinking cold beers at his joint called Silent Lodge in his Othaya hometown. According to the Nation, President Kibaki’s favorite bartender, Shem Macharia, has fond memories of Kibaki’s love for Whitecap. “Mzee was always calm and easy even when he was out with friends. He did not like the rowdiness that some people have while drinking. He just wanted to have a conversation and relax with his friends,” Mr Macharia says. He enjoyed the bottle with peers, before quitting after a near fatal accident in 2002. Dr Dan Gikonyo is clear, the former president Mwai Kibaki was a disciplined person especially when it came to matters his own health. The doctor is clear the president never tasted alcohol when he got into statehouse despite him being a big fun of white cap for many years then. Kibaki will also be remembered for his generosity. He often shared his meals with friends and other carousers.
