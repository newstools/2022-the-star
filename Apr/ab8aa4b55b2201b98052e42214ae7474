Earlier, Energy CS Monica Juma announced that the fuel crisis will be resolved within 72 hours and Kenya will have fuel lasting till the end of June. Kenyans are expected to be relieved from the fuel shortage panic as normalcy returns on Sunday, April 17. Juma added that the Kenya Pipeline Company Macharia Ichungu reported that the fuel reserves are full. She accused oil marketers of hoarding fuel awaiting price increases and said that the government and oil marketers have had meetings over the crisis. She further urged Kenyans to avoid the panic purchase of fuel once it returns. She also said that the government subsidy will cushion fuel prices hike. Kenya has experienced a fuel shortage for three weeks, which has been termed a global energy crisis owing to the ongoing Russia- Ukraine war.
