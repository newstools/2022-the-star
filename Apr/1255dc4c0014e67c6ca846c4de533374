Former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko now claims that UDA had approached him for the Nairobi top seat. Sonko says that he opted for the Wiper ticket in Mombasa due to his close relationship, and respect for the party leader Kalonzo Musyoka. He claimed that he had refused to pick the nomination from the party but his friendship with Kalonzo forced him to accept the offer. "Kalonzo is an elder to me, he is like my father.  He is a relative...Actually, I had a direct nomination for UDA  in Nairobi, but because of the respect I give to Kalonzo, I decided to respect his offer," Kalonzo said. The former Nairobi governor made the remarks on Tuesday during the party's function which saw aspirants being awarded their certificates ahead of the August 9 elections. He added that Nairobi residents had also promised to vote for him even if he would stand as an independent candidate in Nairobi. Sonko also dismissed the claims that he has been presented as the governor aspirant to spoil for others saying that he is in the race to win. He ditched President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee in March and joined Wiper. He said the decision came following the ups and downs in Jubilee, including his impeachment in December 2020. Sonko is in the race to succeed governor Ali Hassan Joho who is serving his second and last term in office. He is facing a tight race from ODM candidate Abdulswamad Nassir. The Wiper party announced that Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo will be Sonko's running mate.
