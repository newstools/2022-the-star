Twenty-four games have been lined up for the third leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation men's league starting today at Nyayo Stadium. Every club in the 16-team league will play three matches apiece for the three-day competition. Defending champions General Service Unit take on Vihiga, Rift Valley Prisons, and Kenya Forest Service respectively. GSU coach Gideon Tarus said in as much as they respect their opponents, he believes they have what it takes to bag maximum points in their encounters. "Our opponents are playing well but what matters most will be nine points," Tarus stated. "Preparations have been better, morale is high and the boys can't wait to compete. The aim is to retain the KVF title. People doubted us at the start of the season because we lost vital players to professional stints overseas but we have silenced them through winning." Last season's runners-up Kenya Prisons have a date with Nairobi Prisons, Prisons Mombasa as well as Kenya Defense Forces (KDF). Fast-rising Kenya Ports Authority hope to get the better of  Prisons Central, Trail Blazers, and Nairobi Prisons. Newbies Trail Blazers will also fancy their chances against Administration Police and Kenya Army. While Equity Bank settles scores with Prisons Mombasa, KDF and Vihiga team, KDF will be up against Western Prisons and Prisons Kenya. KFS will also tackle Rift Valley Prisons and Nyanza Prisons on Saturday and Sunday respectively. The western derby pit Western Prisons against Vihiga while the former takes on Rift Valley Prisons. Vihiga will square it out with Equity on Sunday. AP will line up against Prisons Nairobi, and Prisons Mombasa while Nyanza Prisons will battle with Kenya Army, KFS, and Prisons Central.
