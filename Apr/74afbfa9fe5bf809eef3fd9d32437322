Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday met with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Tharaka Nithi Senator Kindiki Linturi, and Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua at his Karen office. This comes at a time when the DP is expected to name his running mate. Political chatter has it that the three stand a chance to deputies the DP. Ruto and the three leaders were pictured having hearty laughter as they engaged at the DP's official residence. Earlier, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) revised the running mate submission dates from April 28 to May 16. This came after both Kenya Kwanza and Azimio la Umoja protested the Thursday deadline. The window was also extended for governor seat candidates.
