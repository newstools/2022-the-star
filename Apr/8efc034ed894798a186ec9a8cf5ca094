Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga has claimed the state plans to use chiefs and their assistants to ensure he is not reelected in August. He said this was after he refused to toe the line by supporting Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, who is enjoying the support of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Jubilee government. And since investigating agencies have not found any charges against him, he said, they are vowing to use every means at their disposal to ensure he does not win. “I am wondering if it is their votes that matter or if it is your votes that matter?” he posed. In December last year, Kahiga had claimed government investigative agencies sent letters to his county secretary only days after he decamped from Jubilee to Deputy President William Ruto’s led UDA party. The agencies, he said, were requesting for files dating back to 2018 to enable them to carry out investigations. Kahiga spoke on Wednesday during a meeting with members of farmers' cooperatives in Nyeri. The meeting brought together the county leadership and more than 100 farmers’ cooperative societies from the Mt Kenya region. The governor drummed-up support for Ruto. “This country can only work when it is put in the hands of a young, able, capable and proven leader. We have no problem with Jakom [Raila], he is good, but his time is gone,” he said. Kahiga said Raila is elderly and should now retire from politics. “Let us be people living in the present but thinking about the future. We cannot be a people living in the present but thinking of the past. It doesn’t work,” he said. “We must think about where we are going, not where we are coming from and it is exemplified by the two kinds of leaders we have. One belongs to the past and the other one belongs to the future.” He urged Uhuru to remain neutral and stop drumming up support for Raila. Kahiga said Uhuru should let Kenyans elect a president of their choice. Edited by A.N
