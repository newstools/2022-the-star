Kenya will flex muscles with Burundi, Namibia and Cameroon in Group C of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers. According to the draws conducted in Johannesburg South Africa on Tuesday, the top two teams in the group will join the rest from 11 other pools at the Afcon finals in Ivory Coast primed for June 23 to July 23. The first two qualifying matchdays will be held anytime between May 30 and June 14, with two more rounds between September 19 and 27. The final two rounds have been slated for March 20-28. However, Kenya's participation could end up being a mirage if conditions set by the Zurich-based world football governing body, Fifa, are not addressed in time to lift the suspension that was imposed a month ago. The country brushed FIFA the wrong way after Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed expelled the Nick Mwendwa-led Football Kenya Federation (FKF) administration and constituted a caretaker committee to run football in the country on November 12. Interestingly, Zimbabwe has also been included in the tournament despite facing a similar predicament. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) said in a statement issued on Tuesday they were optimistic the two countries would resolve the issues that occasioned their suspensions. “We have included the two countries in the hope that the bans will be lifted not later than two weeks before the first matchday in June,” Consequently, CAF have set a deadline of mid May for the bans to be lifted failure to which the countries risk losing their slots. "In case the suspension is not lifted two weeks before the match day of the qualifiers, both associations will be considered as losers and eliminated from the competition," said part of the communication from Caf then,” the statement read in part. “Consequently their groups will be composed of three teams. The first and the runners up of groups of these teams will qualify to the final tournament.”
