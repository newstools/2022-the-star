UDA aspirants in Embu have the party to conduct a free and fair nomination exercise next Thursday. Embu gubernatorial aspirant Cecily Mbarire said the party should ensure all contestants compete on a level playing ground. Mbarire spoke on Wednesday during the party aspirants meeting at Kangaru, Embu. "Our biggest concern is the preparedness of the party for an efficient, free and fair nominations exercise," she said. The gubernatorial aspirant said the party should also ensure each candidate is protected. "We request for free and fair nominations, especially on female candidates whom violence is used against us. We urge the party to ensure they don't tolerate any form of violence by any aspirant," she said. Others who spoke during the meeting include Mbeere South MP and aspirant Geoffrey King'ang'i and Johnson Mucangi who is eyeing Kagaari North MCA post. King'ang'i said he is quite certain the nominations will be free and fair and no one is preferred over the other by the party. "We are all members of the party and the only person who will decide is the people," he said. Muchangi said he trusts the party electoral board and he is ready to perform his part and leave the election oversight to the board. "We (aspirants) can't be the players and the referee at the same time. I will do my part and leave the party electoral board to conduct her assigned mandate," he said. Embu party coordinator Joshua Kanake however said the party will conduct a free and fair nominations exercise next week. He said the party is set to conduct nominations at 710 centres within the county. "We will conduct the nominations according to the IEBC list of centres," he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
