Instagram has confirmed to TechCrunch that it is working on a new feature that will allow users to feature posts on their profiles. Just like pinning of tweets and TikTok, only this time, for grid posts on Instagram. The new feature is currently in the testing phase and is showing up for selected users on the platform. “We’re testing a new feature that lets people feature posts on their profile,” a spokesperson from Meta told TechCrunch in an email. Users who have access can do this by selecting the three-dot menu next to posts on their posts. At the moment, users have the option to pin stories to their profile, but this new feature would expand this ability to post. The feature will be beneficial for creators and influencers who post frequently but want to highlight a specific post.
