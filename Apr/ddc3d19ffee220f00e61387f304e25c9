Syombua Mbete of Mwingi town is pleading for help to see three of her sons who sat for the 2021 KCPE exam join Form 1. The single mother of seven says she lives from hand to mouth and is jobless. Her three sons who attended Kasina Primary School scored 296, 252 and 245 marks. Mbete said feeding her large family has been a challenge as she does odds jobs and often they go to bed hungry. She has another son in Form 1 in Mulangoni, Tseikuru, but she is uncertain he will report back to school. Mbete said her son has a fee balance of Sh7,000. "Schools have opened but he is still at home, with zero hopes that he will go back." The family lives in a rented iron sheet house in Mwingi town. She says sometimes they sleep in the cold after the landlord locks the house following months of unpaid rent. Mbete urged people of goodwill to help her take her children to school as only education will rescue her from the jaws of poverty. Her firstborn daughter's education was cut short after completing Standard 8. Miriama Mawia said the situation in her mother's home is dire and would appreciate any aid from well-wishers. The mother of one, who is also jobless, said her brothers are willing to join Form 1 but their hope lies on well-wishers. She said she is afraid her three brothers' education might also be cut short due to poverty and pleads with Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and other leaders to come to their rescue.
