The nomination of Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo and Alego-Usonga MP Samuel Atandi as the ODM flag bearers for the MP seats has been upheld. The tribunal sitting in Kisumu dismissed the petition filed by Jalang'o Midiwo against Odhiambo. The chairman of the tribunal Fredrick Orego who read the verdict said the appellant failed to prove that the nominations were not conducted within the law and in conformity to the rules of the ODM primaries. Midiwo, according to the tribunal, also failed to demonstrate that there was widespread violence and irregularities that would invalidate the outcome of the exercise. The tribunal upheld the nomination of Odhiambo and directed that the certificate be issued to him and the judgement be served to ODM National Election Board. The tribunal also directed that Atandi be issued the nomination certificate. Orego noted that the petitioner, Nicholas Kut Ochogo, failed to demonstrate the nominations were not conducted within the provisions of the law. The tribunal while dismissing the petition further observed that the appellant did not prove that there was widespread violence and irregularities that would affect the outcome of the primaries. The nominations were carried out by the party last Wednesday and the official results were announced by the party at the Siaya Institute. But Kut and Midiwo, upset by the results, moved to the party's appeals board seeking to have them nullified. On Tuesday, Midiwo, who's Raila Odinga's cousin, asked ODM's NEB to nullify the certificate issued to Odhiambo on account that the nominations were irredeemably flawed. Kut on his part poked holes in the nomination process that gave Atandi the certificate, saying the exercise was not transparent, not accountable and could not be verified.
