Tusker head coach Robert Matano said he was satisfied with the quality of officiating in their 2-0 win over Gor Mahia at Narok Stadium on Saturday. The remarks were a stark contrast to the acerbic utterances he made a week ago after their first leg encounter at Thika Stadium, where he tore into centre referee 'for denying them a last-gasp winner'. “The officiating was superb this afternoon and we have no reason to complain whatsoever. There is no way I could ever raise concerns if I lose fairly,” Matano said. Gor's Andreas Spier expressed fear they have botched up their title chances following the defeat, adding that his charges fell short of expectations. “We didn't play according to the script. Today's defeat has compromised our title hopes because the gap between us and the top team has widened,” Spier said. Shaphan Oyugi fired the brewers ahead barely three minutes into the match after dispossessing Dennis Ng'ang'a a few yards from goal. Coach Matano's decision to introduce Deogratius Ojok at the restart bore fruits when the Ugandan forward headed home to double the advantage in the dying minutes of the game. The outcome fired Tusker to within seven points of runaway leaders Kakamega Homeboyz, who host Sofapaka at Bukhungu Stadium on Monday. The brewers have 46 points from 26 matches.
