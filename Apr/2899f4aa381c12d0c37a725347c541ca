A section of UDA aspirants was in shock and disbelief after they discovered their names were missing on the party register. Kaimenyi Kinoti, the Abuthuguchi West Aspirant, who did not appear in the party register, was in deep shock and wondered why that had happened. "I wonder I am not in the register. I am shocked one of my opponents has been going around claiming he has been given a direct ticket," Kinoti said. "We will follow all legal procedures to overturn any decision made by a few individuals. They should not make any single mistake. We will defend what belongs to us and our people of Abuthuguchi West." Njeru Kanyamba, an aspirant for Nyaki East, did not appear on the party register too. He claimed the move seeks to have the party's ticket handed to his opponent. Hellen Gichuru, the Nkubu Primary school Polling station presiding officer, confirmed that some names were missing under unclear circumstances. "We opened at 7 am but only a few people had turned out to vote," Gichuru said. Geoffrey Mwiti and Silas Kinyua demanded UDA party answers from the party. "I met a huge line of fellow voters and then my time arrived, I presented my ID but couldn't be found in the voter's register," he said. Kawira Kinyua from Mwiteria Day secondary polling station was amused by the turn of events. "I wonder some people I know are long dead do appear in the register but I am nowhere. This is a way of imposing bad leaders on us. We are not satisfied. I came here to vote for someone who will permanently change my life," he said.
