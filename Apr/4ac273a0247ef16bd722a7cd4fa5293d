Jubilee secretary general Jeremiah Kioni has explained why the ruling party opted to have negotiated democracy in their nominations. Kioni said despite the party shunning the process previously, it has turned out to be one of the best ways to deal with diversity as a country. He cited the communities from North Eastern Kenya that continue to embrace the practice, adding that this will strengthen Kenya's democracy. "In the past, we did not value negotiated democracy that was being practised within the pastoralist community but it has come to pass that it is one of the best ways of dealing with our diversity as a country is to encourage negotiated democracy. That has informed the processes of nomination within Jubilee," Kioni stated. During the presser, the Ndaragua MP noted that discussions are ongoing across counties as they hope to come to an agreement with all aspirants. Kioni added that certificates will be issued to candidates, once the process is complete. "We are discussing with many people at the county level. We have our National Elections Board in place and the disciplinary committee and once we are done with that process the issuance of certificates will commence." He said those without competitors will start receiving their certificates as early as next week. The Jubilee secretary-general said the second phase of certificates will be issued the week after for those who will have agreed on a consensus. Issuance of nomination certificates will then end with those from areas where they will be required hold nominations.
