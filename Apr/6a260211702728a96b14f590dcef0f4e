Kenya Simbas head coach Paul Odera is more concerned about kicking and breakdowns as they prepare to face Zimbabwe in the Currie Cup match on Saturday. Speaking on Wednesday, Odera said those two areas will be key in their match against African rivals. “In our first match, we struggled in those two facets of play. However,  we have had intensive training for the last one week and the boys are in good spirits and raring to go,” added Odera. Odera urged his charges to be clinical and play in the right areas of the pitch despite tough opposition. “We need to play in the right areas and concentrate the ball in Zimbabwe's half. We must also be clinical and not give away penalties to the opposition,” Odera noted. Former Kenya Under-20 and Strathmore Leos coach said the side has since adjusted to the cold and windy conditions in their training base in Cape Town. "We have acclimatised quite well to the weather and from what we gather, the weather will be even colder for the next two months as we play in this competition." Odera lauded Western Province for the technical support so far ahead of their match against Zimbabwe. “We have received assistance from them in several aspects of play, especially in the forwards. We are delighted that we will be working with them for the next two months,” noted Odera. The Simbas last played the Sables in 2019 in Nakuru in the  Victoria Cup with Kenya winning 36-14. However, Odera expects a close contest this time round. "History will count for nothing. Zimbabwe are well prepared and have been in South Africa for a longer period. This no doubt promises to be a very close contest and we relish the challenge,” he added. The Simbas are using the Currie Cup as preparation for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers which will be held in France in July. The four teams in the Currie Cup will progress to the semifinals slated for June,
