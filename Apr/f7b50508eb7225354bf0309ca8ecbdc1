Even as the National Cereals and Produce Board says distribution of subsidised fertiliser is going on smoothly, farmers in North Rift are anticipating a drop in food production this year. According to small scale farmers representative David Kiberenge, they are not getting much of the subsidised fertiliser as was promised by Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya. Last week, Munya visited the North Rift to launch distribution of the subsidy and said registered farmers will be allowed to purchase a maximum of 20 bags. "NCPB  is giving farmers five bags only, despite CS Munya's directive that we should get at most 20 bags. That is not sufficient given that farmers had already spent a lot buying high cost fertiliser from the open market," Kiberenge said. NCPB is selling the DAP fertiliser at Sh 2,800 per 50kg bag. Top dressing fertiliser CAN sell at Sh1,950, Urea (Sh2,700) and NPK (nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium) at Sh3,000. The government rolled out the subsidy programme at a cost of Sh5.7 billion. However, NCPB chief executive Andrew Kimote said the distribution is smooth and they will ensure every farmer benefits from the subsidy. Uasin Gishu county Agriculture executive Samuel Yego has also warned of a possible drop in maize production due to limited availability of fertiliser. “Many farmers have cut down on the acreage they have been putting under maize production and this is likely to cause a huge drop in maize production,"  Yego said. The subsidy came in after some farmers had already planted their crops using the high cost fertiliser. The director of the Kenya Farmers Association Kipkorir Menjo echoed Yego's sentiments saying maize farmers are also counting heavy losses following delayed rains. “The rains have delayed in most areas and the dry spell could compound the situation for farmers who have gone through a lot of expenses including high costs of farm inputs," Menjo said.
