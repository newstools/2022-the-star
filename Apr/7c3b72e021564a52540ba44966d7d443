Former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has dismissed reports that he has withdrawn from the county's top job race. He urged his supporters not to believe propaganda on social media. Akaranga told the Star on the phone on Wednesday that he is still a strong contender in the race. "Those who think that posting such information on social media will stop me are misinformed," he said. Akaranga said he has all it takes to recapture the seat on August 9. He said the votes are with the people and not on social media. "I want to go back to that office and finish what I started," he said. He said he has a robust development agenda for Vihiga people and his campaigns are well-planned. Edited by A.N
