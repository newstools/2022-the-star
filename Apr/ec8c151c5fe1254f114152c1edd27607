Diamond Platnumz allegedly walked down the aisle a few days ago. The news was broken on his Wasafi TV by presenter Diva. She said Diamond wed at a private occasion, and that a government official also contacted her about the same. In a phone interview with Juma Lokole, who is also Diamond's close friend, Juma said Diamond's wife is from Zanzibar. He added that Diamond's mum is very excited about the news. Speaking about Diamond's bae, Juma said, "Diamond has married secretly. Tena mtoto mbichi. Tena mtoto anayejua dini vibaya mno. Diva, I am giving this exclusive. I found him (Diamond) praying in his house, something he rarely does, he starts praying at 1am." Diva said a prominent person in the government also hinted that to her as well. "She is from Zanzibar. It was time for him to get married as he had already achieved all he wanted." Juma added that Diamond chose to marry during Ramadhan so he could spend time together with his new wife. "He will reveal details after the Ramadhan period and he might also post on his social media. Mama Dangote is also very happy since her son has been on people's mouths about him being a single man despite his wealth." Diamond has not commented on the issue, but his family members have sent him congratulatory messages. He has, however, been using people close to him to chase clout when he is working on a music project. This time round, he has released a 'Qaswida' that he's been featured in by Mbosso alongside Ricardo Momo. Diamond's sister Esma Dangote put up a beautiful message, congratulating her brother for finding love again. "My young bro, I support you. Can’t wait for everyone to meet your new love. Mpo tayari!!? Unajua ulipo na mimi nipo siku zote. Yuda mie yanini mie!!! English Material ya bwana Foa @esma_dangote." Diamond's brother Romy Jons wrote, "Mdogo wangu akisema aoe mwezi huu hizo baraka ni zake mimi sisemi. Wa kuoa tusmchagulie tafadhali."
