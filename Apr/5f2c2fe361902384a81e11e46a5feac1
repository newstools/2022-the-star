In the next five years, all Kenyan women can be able to have access to modern contraception if current trends continue. This is according to a prediction by Equal Measures 2030’s gender equality calculator. “In Kenya, 75 per cent of women had access to modern contraception for the latest year reported. Kenya ranks in the top 25 per cent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa on access to modern contraception,” it said. However, the 2020 SDG Report shows that the Covid-19 pandemic risks reversing progress in SDG number 3 on Good Health and Wellbeing, with childhood vaccination programmes, family planning services and health screening services all limited during the pandemic. By 2030, the calculator predicts that Kenya will meet the target of reasonable laws to protect gender equality at work if current trends continue. “Kenya scored 90 out of 100 points for laws that protect gender equality at work for the latest year reported. Kenya ranks in the top 25 per cent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa on laws on workplace equality,” it said. It further found that roughly 45 years from now, Kenyan women will be able to say they feel safe walking alone at night if current trends continue. “Currently, 49 per cent of women said they feel safe walking alone at night for the latest year reported while Kenya ranks in the top 50 per cent of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa on women's perceptions of public safety,” it said. It finally predicts that it will be a lifetime by the time all women in Kenya attain at least some secondary education if current trends continue. “In Kenya, 30 per cent of women had attained at least some secondary education for the latest year reported. UNESCO estimated that 11 million girls may not return to school. “Girls aged 12-17 are at particular risk of dropping out of school in low-income countries due to pandemic,” it concluded.
