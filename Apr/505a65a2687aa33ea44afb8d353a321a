Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris was on Monday at the centre of social media reports indicating that she had stepped down in her Nairobi Woman representative bid. The second Nairobi Woman Rep is seeking to retain her seat in the August 9, polls under the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance. Passaris termed the reports on her quitting as fake and urged her followers to dismiss them. She stated that her desire to serve Nairobi residents for a second term is on. “My attention has been drawn to malicious, and false allegations purporting that I have stepped down from defending my seat. Nothing could be further from the truth. Serving the People of Nairobi as their Woman Representative has been a great honour, and I intend to continue this noble journey,” Passaris tweeted. A hashtag dubbed #PassarisEndorsesAnita went viral on social media insinuating that the Woman Rep had quit. Passaris is facing off with Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga of the UDA party for the Woman representative seat. She is eyeing the ODM ticket together with Nominated Senator Beatrice Kwamboka in her second bid for the City job. Passaris was elected in 2017 when she ousted Rachael Shebesh of the ruling Jubilee party.
