Residents of Malaha village in Webuye West can now get water with ease after an MCA aspirant opened a tap at his homestead to curb shortage. The area has been facing acute water shortage forcing residents to trek long distances in search of the precious commodity. Ruth Wekesa, a beneficiary, lauded businessman Stephen Kaiser Simiyu, also known as Steve Sonko, for the initiative. Simiyu is seeking the Matulo ward representative seat under the Ford Kenya party. "The water has really helped us and the neighbouring schools," Wekesa said. The area has only one borehole that serves residents and is dry most of the time. "Drawing water from the borehole was tiresome and time-consuming due to the long queue," she said. Beatrice Masika, another resident, said they were fetching in rivers that were infested with snakes, posing danger to their lives. Masika said the water crisis caused children to miss and even drop out of school. Simiyu said he decided to come up with the water project to improve the lives of the residents. "Women have been forced to wake up as early as 5am daily in search of water. I had to step up and provide a solution. Residents can now easily access clean water for domestic use and for their animals," he said. Kaiser said if elected, he will ensure the entire ward has access to clean and affordable water.
