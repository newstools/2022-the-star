Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said that public primary schools received the required tools to make digital learning possible. He said schools received teacher and learner digital devices, digital content servers, wireless routers and projectors through the Developmental Learning Program (DLP). Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results on Saturday, Magoha said the Government initiated the Digital Learning Programme in 2013. He said it was out of the conviction that technology has the power to improve learning outcomes, while also preparing learners to thrive in the 21st century. "This will also make Kenyans more competitive in the global economy," he said. He further said a total of 21,717 out of 22,988 primary schools (94%) have been supplied with these digital devices. The CS said installation is in progress for the remaining schools that are newly registered. "The Government has up-scaled efforts to optimise utilisation of the DLP infrastructure to improve learning outcomes in schools." Last year October, teachers in special needs institutions from four counties were trained on assistive technologies and accessible digital textbooks to impart ICT literacy to learners. The five-day workshop at the Kenya Institute of Special Education ran concurrently with the University of Rwanda and Uganda. Officials from Kiambu County say ICT integration has greatly contributed to the good performance posted by schools in the county in last year's KCSE exam. The schools were earmarked for the African Digital Schools Initiative (ADSI) programme which was started in 2016 by the global e-schools and communities initiative (GESCI). They are expected to be ambassadors of ICT integration as the programme seeks to cover the other more than 300 schools in the county.
