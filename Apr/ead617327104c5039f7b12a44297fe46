Kakamega Homeboyz coach Bernard Mwalala has warned his players against complecency despite their good run in the Kenya Premier League. The tactician told the players to focus on the remaining eight matches ahead if they have any ambitions of winning the Kenya Premier League title this season. In an interview after fighting from a goal down to salvage a point against Sofapaka at Bukhungu Stadium on Sunday, coach Mwalala advised his players to treat each match as a final. "During this final stretch of the league, games are always very difficult. You should, therefore, never underestimate any team because everyone wants to end the season strongly." "We are going back to the drawing board to see how best we can approach each of the remaining eight matches. "At the moment, we are taking each match at a time and we believe we are in control of our own destiny," noted Mwalala. David Okoth, who scored an equaliser for Homeboyz, echoed Mwalala's sentiments and urged the fans to rally behind the team during this crucial period. He expressed satisfaction with the single point picked against Sofapaka, who he described as one of the strongest teams in the league. He added that being at the top of the league gives their opponents every reason to approach them with caution. He, however, exuded confidence that the league title is still in their hands and all they needed was to remain focused, Kakamega Homeboyz still maintain their top position on the table with 54 points from 26 matches.
