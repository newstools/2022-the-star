Mombasa Sports Club are ready to shake off the underdog's tag as they take on  Strathmore Gladiators in the season opener on Saturday at the City Park Stadium. The coastal side, who also face Kenya Police on Sunday, are in their first season in the top tier and will have to work extra hard to maintain their status in the top league. "The general perception is that we are underdogs because other teams don't know us. We will, however, put ourselves to task and ensure we don't lose any of the matches this weekend," said captain Mariano Emadau. "We have had two teams from Mombasa play in Nairobi and none has lost any of their matches so losing won't start with us. If anything, Western Jaguars were the inform team prior to the season but got a reality check with a 3-0 loss against Sailors. Underrate MSC at your own peril," Emadau bullishly remarked. MSC recorded more away points during their time in the Super League in 2019. MSC have signed  Tonny Simiyu to shore up their midfield. Kevin Ayako and Savio Rawlins are the two other players expected to play a crucial role. "Simiyu brings energy while Ayako and Rawlins are youthful with a bright future ahead of them. They played against Strathmore during the University Games last weekend and we have  a rough idea of how 'Strath' play." Emadau observed that Police are a physically fit team despite their mixed start to the 2022 season. "They (Police) boast of quality. They are an experienced side and look sharper and we have to be flawless in our approach." Elsewhere, Western Jaguars host both USIU-A Mashujaa and Wazalendo respectively this weekend in Kakamega. Jaguars beat Police 2-1 but lost 3-0 to Sailors last weekend. Greensharks have a date with Sailors as Gladiators settle scores with Parkroad Badgers. The badgers are winless in their opening two matches. In the women's category, Lakers welcome USIU-A Spartans in Kisumu while record champions Blazers entertain Wolverines.
