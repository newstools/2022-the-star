Apple plans to add a highly anticipated blood pressure monitor to its smart watch by 2024, this is as reported by Bloomberg. In addition to sleep tracking, a tool to remind people to take medicine, the company could also add body temperature sensing to the Apple watch. Blood pressure is a major target for wearable companies and could make devices significantly more useful for tracking cardiac health. But the feature is notoriously tricky, and experts say it still needs more refinement before it can perform well in the real world. At the moment, the tech used in smartwatches can generally check whether the blood pressure is rising or falling. The company however faces major competition from Samsung which has launched watches with a blood pressure feature among other features. Apple also is also planning to add more workout types and additional metrics related to running within the Workout app on the watch.
