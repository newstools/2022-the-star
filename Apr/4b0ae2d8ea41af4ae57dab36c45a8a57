Azimio la Umoja One-Kenya presidential candidate Raila Odinga has called on Kenyans to unite in the spirit of Easter for the common good of the country. Through a video message on Twitter on Saturday, Raila urged Kenyans to emulate the bravery that Jesus Christ faced death with and remain united amidst the currently facing the country. He said inasmuch as Easter has come at a difficult time, it has taught us the benefits of courage, integrity, love and empathy as illustrated by Jesus even as he faced eminent death. "When you read the Bible, it reminds you how Jesus was presented before Pilate, the Romans had accused him of blasphemy for claiming to be the son of God. Jesus never defended himself...he was not afraid of death," Raila said. He said if all Kenyans emulate the unrivaled bravery demonstrated by Jesus, no challenge would be insurmountable for the country. "As Kenyans, if we unite together, there is nothing we cannot overcome or achieve. We are celebrating Easter at a difficult time but all this will pass," Raila said. The ODM leader said it is this very purpose of uniting the country in the face of adversity that informed the formation of the Azimio la Umoja movement. The movement has adopted "inawezekana" [it can be done] as its campaign slogan. "We want a new beginning...for us to achieve the dreams of our forefathers," Raila said. He said Easter is a perfect demonstration that mankind's time on earth is limited. Easter, also called Pascha or Resurrection Sunday, is a Christian festival and cultural holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. It's described in the New Testament as having occurred on the third day after his burial following his crucifixion by the Romans at Calvary. Jesus' death is commemorated by Christians on Good Friday.
