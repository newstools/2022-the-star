ODM branches in the North Rift have rejected a plan to issue direct tickets to aspirants. Supporters protested in Eldoret, claiming some party officials were planning to issue the direct tickets to unknown people. A row erupted after reports that ODM had issued a direct ticket to Turbo MP aspirant Richard Kemboi, leaving out Samkiz Mugo, who has been hosting the Orange party and Azimio la Umoja rallies in the region. “We will not allow our party to be messed up by some individuals who issue direct tickets to moles or brokers," Andrew Ouma, a jua kali sector leader in Eldoret said. Ouma led the jua kali artisans in the protests, saying Mugo had invested heavily in campaigning for ODM boss Raila Odinga and he should be considered for the party ticket. “The party should issue the direct ticket to Samkiz Mugo and not someone we don’t know," Ouma said. The supporters threatened to quit the party, if Mugo is not given a direct ticket or primaries held to determine the party candidate. Turbo is the home constituency of Deputy President William Ruto. The incumbent MP is Janet Sitienei, who was elected as an independent candidate. The area, which covers a large section of Eldoret town, is largely cosmopolitan and an aspirant from any community stands a chance to win. In the last election, businessman Kevin Okwara won the Jubilee primaries but lost to Sitienei. In his response, Kemboi said it was important for the party to give him a direct ticket because he had the capacity to win the seat. Kipkorir Menjo, ODM coordinator in the Rift Valley, said they had many aspirants seeking to vie for seats through Azimio allied parties. He said the party would determine the best way to ensure it has strong aspirants to face UDA in the August 9 polls. “We have very strong support in the North Rift and we will work to ensure that we win as many seats as possible and make Raila the next president," Menjo said.
