Harmonize won three awards over the weekend in the recently completed Tanzanian Music Awards. While receiving the Artiste of the Year award, the 'Mwaka Wangu' singer dedicated it to his mentor-cum-frenemy Diamond Platnumz. "This means a lot to me. This goes to my brothers and sisters who haven't received an award," he said. "This one is for you, Diamond. It wouldn't sound good if I took an award home, yet Diamond doesn't have one." At the award ceremony, Harmonize also continued to beg his ex girlfriend Fridah Kajala to take him back. Diamond was given the award of honour in absentia. "He has brought a lot of positive change in the music industry. He has promoted the Kiswahili language and created employment," said a representative of the Tanzanian National Arts Council.
