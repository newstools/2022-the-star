County Assemblies in Kenya have witnessed several standoffs that have seen speakers shown the door through impeachment. The impeachments of these speakers were fueled by irreconcilable differences among the members of the assemblies. Among those who faced impeachment include former Nairobi County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi. Elachi fought back in the corridors of justice and managed to be reinstated but she later resigned from the seat.
