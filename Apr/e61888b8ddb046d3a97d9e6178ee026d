There is a huge potential of cassava flour in the Kenya market, now that food prices have gone up. Cassava flour which is produced from the Cassava root is gluten-free, grain-free and it is soft just like flour. Research shows that over time, gluten causes damage to the intestines, impairing the ability to absorb nutrients. That is why some people tend to react to gluten. Compared to wheat, cassava contains up to sixteen times more fiber and four times less digestible sugar, making it nutritionally superior. But opting for commercially available cassava, which has been tested and doesn’t contain harmful levels of the toxins is the safest option. Experts say that cassava flour is actually good for the gut. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Bring 2 cups of water to boiling using a sufuria.
