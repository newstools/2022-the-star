Fast-rising road racer Evans Chebet said the tactical strategy was key for him as he dominated the  Boston Marathon alongside Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir on Monday. Chebet clocked 2:06.51 in the warm conditions to lead a Kenyan sweep in the men's category while Jepchirchir carried the day in the women's category after a fierce battle with Ethiopia's Yeshaneh Ababel. Jepchirchir's winning time was 2:21.01. The 2019 Boston Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono finished second in 2:07:21 with last year's champion Benson Kipruto rounding off the podium positions in 2:07.27 in the men's cadre. The women's race saw Mary Ngugi place third in 2:21:32 behind Yeshaneh in second place in 2:21:05. In an interview after the race, Chebet, who is also the winner of the 2020 Valencia Marathon, said he opted to increase the pace at the 23-mile mark because the race was too slow. " The coach had advised me to bolt from the pack if I ever saw the pace go down. This is exactly what I did and I am happy I won the race," he said. He said he realized he was going to carry the day at the 35-km mark. " However, I only felt comfortable with four kilometres and was confident of the victory. I even opened a gap and kept my focus," an excited Chebet said after crossing the finish line. Chebet failed to finish the same event four years ago and was delighted that this time around the focus was on him as a winner. "In 2018, I failed to finish and at some point was forced to sit on the course. To come back and win the event this year is good and I can't wait to celebrate with my people," he quipped. Chebet also had victories in the Buenos Aires Marathon in 2019 and the Lake Biwa in the same year. Tanzania's Gabriel Geay came home fourth in 2:07:53 as Evans Kiptanui completed the top five places in 2:08:47.  Kenya's Albert Korir (2:08:50),  USA's Fauble Scott (2:08:52) Ethiopia's Yimer Jemal (2:08:58), Kenya's Elknaha Kibet (2:09:07), and Ethiopia's Atanaw Kinde (2:09:16) wrapped up the top 10 places. Jepchirchir, who is also New York Marathon champion, termed her feat a win for Kenya. She described the race as one of the toughest she has ever run. "I felf tired especially in the final few kilometres but I did not lose hope. I thank God for the victory but I am grateful to the organizers for inviting me,” she said. The two athletes collided during the race but Jepchirchir played down the incident as friendly fire. “She is my friend and we apologized to each other. It was an accident and we both understood and moved on with the race,” she added. Edna Kiplagat was placed fourth in 2:21.40 as Monica Ngige finished fifth in 2:22:13. Kenyan-born Viola Cheptoo was placed sixth in 2:23:47.
