Brentford continued their resurgent form by beating West Ham United 2-0 at home on Sunday to rack up a fourth win in five matches and take another step towards guaranteeing their Premier League survival. Fresh from their shock 4-1 win at Champions League holders Chelsea last week, Thomas Frank's side overwhelmed another side with European ambitions, Bryan Mbeumo opening the scoring in the second half before top scorer Ivan Toney doubled the lead. Brentford struck first after quick-thinking following a throw-in as Toney slipped the ball into the path of French forward Mbeumo, who slotted into the net with a first-time finish in the 48th minute. Mbeumo repaid the favour by crossing for Toney to head home from close range in the 64th and Brentford comfortably saw out the win to climb to 13th in the table on 36 points, 12 clear of the relegation zone. Frank's side lost seven games out of eight before turning the tide with a 3-1 win at Norwich City in early March. The result was a further blow to West Ham's hopes of finishing in the top four as they were left sixth on 51 points, six behind fourth-placed Tottenham.
