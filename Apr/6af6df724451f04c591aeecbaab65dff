Kenya's Under-20 rugby team will miss the opportunity to play in the Junior World Rugby Trophy after losing to Namibia 16-5 in the Barthes Cup semifinal. Chipu, winners of the last two editions, missed three penalties and several try-scoring opportunities in an entertaining duel and head coach Curtis Olago lamented the tactical errors which cost his side dearly. “We had a couple of errors in the match and we couldn't finish off attacking moves in their 22. However, credit to the boys, we played until the final whistle,” added Olago. The KCB coach said the potential for the team looks great going forward and saluted their efforts. “These boys have lots of rugby within them and they have bright careers ahead of them. I am confident they will be great ambassadors for the country,” said Olago. Both sides were evenly matched in the first half and the former champions opened the scoring courtesy of Oeta Blaauw. Cornelius Mukoro missed an opportunity to level matters for Kenya with two missed penalties in the first half as Namibia led 3-0 at the interval. On resumption, Namibia stepped up and fly-half Jimachio William intercepted a pass to score at the corner with Blaauw kicking over the conversion for a 10-0 lead. Tony Okecth had an opportunity to narrow the deficit for the home side but saw his penalty fail to hit the target as pressure mounted. The hosts' indiscipline was punished a minute later with Blaauw kicking another penalty to widen the margin to 13-0. Kenya regrouped and piled pressure on the visitors but twice with the try line beckoning, they missed their opportunities. Blaauw kicked over another penalty following more indiscipline by the Kenyans to take the score 16-0. The hosts finally scored a try with minutes remaining when substitute Joseph Ayiro showed the Namibian defence a clean pair of heels to touch down at the corner for an unconverted try but it proved too late as Namibia held out for the win.
