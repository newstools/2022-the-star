Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are in town ahead of their  Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) League play-off final matches against Ulinzi Warriors this weekend. The porters' tactician Sammy Kiki revealed that they will start strict training today (Tuesday) for their epic weekend fixtures. "Some few players managed to get booking last night (Sunday) while some travelled on Monday," he said. "We couldn't travel together because almost every seat on the bus or train was fully booked." KPA have a fully fit squad for the encounter save for centre player Frank Mayoti who is suspended for Saturday's Game Three. KPA tied the best of the five-game series 1-1 with a 69-58 victory at the Makande Welfare Hall in Mombasa over the weekend. They lost the opening encounter, going down 68-66 to the soldiers in a closely fought match also played in their backyard. Kiki, who hailed his boys for a good response in that win, said he will still rely on the defence to carry the day in Nairobi fixtures. "Despite that win, we still have a few areas to work on ahead of the remaining matches if we are to fight for the title," he noted. William Balozi, the soldiers' coach remained confident Ulinzi will prevail because all his key players are available. Ulinzi, who are nine-time winners are going for their third successive diadem while KPA, inaugural winners in 1987, are gunning for their seventh. Meanwhile, the Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) 2022 season gets underway this weekend with 20 matches on the card. New teams in action are Makueni Flamers, Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) Two Three Four, Zetech University, Ctam Karen and Clique Mambas. The debutants in the women category include Soweto Academy and National Youth Service (NYS).
