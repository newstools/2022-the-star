Traffic police blamed a big number of politicians and their supporters outside Jubilee Party headquarters along Murang’a Road, and a fatal accident in Mlolongo for heavy traffic on major roads in Nairobi. Head of Nairobi traffic Joshua Omukata said there had been a beehive of activities at Jubilee House on Friday afternoon with both those celebrating the wins and those protesting their loses blocking roads there. He added a bus headed for the city Kitengela hit and killed a bodaboda rider in Mlolongo prompting a protest by other riders who blocked the road for almost an hour. “The ripple effects of the incidents have caused traffic jams on major routes which may take some time to ease. We urge patience,” he said. More personnel were sent to various junctions to direct traffic flow late in the event on Friday. Kenyans went online to complain about the situation on their roads calling on police to take action to address it.
