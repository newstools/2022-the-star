The Bulgarian government says it was prepared for Russia's move today to suspend its gas supply. Prime Minister Kiril Petkov has reassured Bulgarians there will be no shortage, and has spoken to the neighbouring Greek government to ensure alternative supplies. Bulgaria gets 90 per cent of its gas from Russia - making it more vulnerable to the Russian move than Poland. But the political reaction in the capital Sofia was robust, reports the BBC's Central Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe. Prime Minister Petkov has accused the Kremlin of racketeering and blackmail. Petkov immediately began talks with the Greek government, with the Greek PM confirming that a crucial interconnector, carrying Azeri gas from Komotini in Greece to Stara Zagora in Bulgaria, will open - as planned - in June. The Greek government also offered supplies of liquefied natural gas to Bulgaria, if needed. The new gas is likely to cost Bulgaria more, however. And the Russian move could increase tensions in the Bulgarian government, where two of the four coalition partners in government are friendlier toward the Russians.
