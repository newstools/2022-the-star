Starehe MP Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar, has denounced reports that he has stepped down in the race to retain his parliamentary seat. In a statement on Wednesday, the MP termed reports that he had been instructed to quit the race by deputy president William Ruto as fake. He also denied holding any negotiations with East Africa Legislative Assembly MP Simon Mbugua which led to him quitting the race for him. "As the sitting M.P of Starehe Constituency I would like to inform my constituents that I have not stepped down for any aspirant and I have not held any discussions with the Deputy President in regards to this matter," Njagua said. "I was elected by the people of Starehe and I have the mandate to represent them. I will not be a party to any negotiations". On negotiating with Mbugua for the seat, Jaguar said: "My opponent agreed to negotiations in his former place. Starehe mambo ni tofauti Wahome Thuku". He made reference to Wahome Thuku because he is among Kenyans who shared on social media that he had been forced to step down. "Charles Kanyi (Jaguar) has been ordered by Karen mercenaries to step down for Simon Mbugua as Starehe MP. His friends are now wondering why and how a sitting MP should be told to step down for another candidate," Wahome said. Mbugua is a former Kamukunji MP but he shifted to Starehe to try his luck after losing the seat. Kamukunji MP seat is currently held by Yusuf Hassan of Azimio.
