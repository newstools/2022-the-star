Radio presenter Alex Mwakideu stopped drinking after he almost missed his first flight due to alcohol. Mwakideu got an opportunity to travel to Germany through his then-boss for an internship programme, and he had everything paid for. Speaking to Kiss FM's Oga Obinna, he said he went to a pub with his friends, drank the whole afternoon, and it only hit him that he was travelling when it was 30 minutes to departure time. "I was high, and running with my big bag since I was going for six months, and when I got there, everything had closed and they refused to let me pass," he said. "I got to Nairobi early and my flight was at night, and I had some money so I was wondering what to do with it. So I called my friend Chiko Lawi and told him I am in Nairobi and he came with some friends to the airport." The officers who were there saw how drunk he was and they asked him to go back home and come the next day. He said he begged for him to be allowed in and even had to bribe to be let in. "There was no way I would have gone back home. What would I have told my boss? And there were also people waiting for me on the other side in Germany. So I begged those people. I told them I knew I had messed up but if I don't get on that flight, my career would have been finished. "The boss came, saw me and asked me if there was anything I had remained with and I only had Sh2,000. I gave him and he allowed me to go and board the plane, five minutes before it left. And that's one of the reasons I stopped drinking."
