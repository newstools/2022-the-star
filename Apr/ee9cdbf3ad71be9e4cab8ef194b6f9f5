Mombasa Sports Club lost 4-3 to Strathmore Scorpions in their season opener of the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League on Saturday at the City Park Stadium. Basil Wafula opened scoring for the students in the 23rd minute before Kelvin Momanyi drew the coastal side seconds later. The Gladiators regained the lead in the 30th minute through Carson Oluoch. Four minutes later, Charles Abongo restored parity for MSC, after converting a penalty short corner. A double from Strathmore's Brian Ogenche seemed to have given Strathmore a two-goal advantage but the Brenda Wangila coached MSC were undone with their business. While Ogenche, a senior member of Strath scored in the 34th and 53rd minute respectively, MSC's James Omondi scored three minutes from regulation time to make it 4-3. Elsewhere, Sailors and Greensharks shared spoils in a 1-1 drab draw. Coached by Samwel Namonyo, Greensharks scored through Christopher Mathenge in the 48th minute of the third quarter before Johnstone Indiazi pulled Sailors back to level terms in the 54th minute. A Brian Kiplimo 40th-minute goal was all that the United States International University USIU-A Mashujaa needed to beat Western Jaguars at their Kakamega backyard. This was Mashujaa's first win of the season in three matches after a draw and a loss in the opening two matches. In the men's Super League, Kisumu Youngsters edged Wazalendo Masters 2-1. Dovan Wanga and David Mokandu gave the lakeside club a 2-0 first half lead. Wanga opened scoring, with a clinical field goal in the 9th minute before Mokandu extended Kisumu's lead in the 15th minute. Silas Mwau's 45th minute strike was rendered a mere consolation. In the women's Super League, Nairobi Chapel club lost 2-1 to MSC. Chapel scored through Winifred Mbite as Alice Jokeyo's double ensured maximum points for MSC. Multimedia University drew 0-0 with Vikings. Editing by Tony Mballa
