Kiambu's top amateur golfer Michael Karanga defied all odds to claim the fourth leg of the Savannah Golf Tour at the par 72 Karen Country Club yesterday. Karanga scored an impressive 5-under par 67, beating a strong field of 81 top professional and amateur golfers. He played a flawless first nine, scoring successive birdies in the first, second, and third holes, and held pars in the rest of the holes. He carried his impressive performance into the second nine, where he hit birdies in the 17th and 18th holes and held pars in the rest. For his efforts, he took home Sh115,000 in accordance with the updated 2022 Rules of Amateur Status as ratified by the Kenya Golf Union. In an interview, Karanga said: "I am very excited about this win today. We had a very strong field and the competition was very tough. I played my best golf and everything was working to my advantage. I have improved on my driver as I am hitting most fairways and my putting is also good. The course was playing easy for me and I was lucky to shoot five birdies.” Meanwhile, Isaiah Otuke, Jacob Okello, and amateur Denis Maara were tied in the second position after each returned a score of 4-under par 68. The three bagged Sh87,000 each for their exploits. Vet Lab Sports Club's Isaiah Otuke had a decent outing on the day, scoring birdies in the first, second, third, 10th, 12th, and 15th holes. Bogeys in the 13th and 17th holes would, however, hold him back as he held pars in the rest of the holes. On his part, Golf Park’s Jacob Okello scored birdies in the third, fifth, and eighth holes on the front nine, while in the back nine, he scored birdies on the 10th and 12th holes – holding pars on the rest of the holes.
