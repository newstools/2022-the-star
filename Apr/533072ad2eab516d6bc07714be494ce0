Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has commissioned Sh43 million irrigation scheme to improve food security. The irrigation scheme will serve Wemilabi and Emabungo wards in Luanda subcounty and Central Bunyore in Emuhaya. Ottichilo while commissioning the scheme on Tuesday, said upon successful completion of the project, 154 households will get water for irrigation. The county boss said if what they have done in Luanda turns out successful it will be replicated in other subcounties. "We want to cut off the farming method where our farmers depend on the rain cycles which are currently unpredictable," Ottichilo said. "Climate change has totally affected the weather patterns so we want our farmers to focus on irrigation." The governor said farmers should go by short term produce that will enhance their productivity and satisfy the market needs. He further urged farmers in the area to plant more of indigenous vegetables, which are in high demand. "The project will be completed by September and in December supply of all indigenous vegetables should have started," he said. Agriculture executive Alfred Indeche said the irrigation scheme will come in handy during the drought season to improve livelihoods and reduce hunger. Chief officer for Agriculture Dominic Luvavo cautioned residents against vandalism in the project and urged them to allow the contractor to do his job since he has also incorporated local manpower. Ottichilo also urged them to plant indigenous trees along the river source supplying water to the irrigation project, adding that the department in collaboration with the Department of Water and Environment will give free tree seedlings to be planted. "Eucalyptus trees planted along the river take in a lot of water which will cause reduction in the water level," Luvavo said. Also present were area MCA Patrick Akhwale and economic Adviser Dr Jairus Amayi.
