Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has insisted that her heart and soul are in the United Democratic Alliance party. Waiguru's remarks came after a video of her referring to DP William Ruto as leader of the Azimio coalition went viral on social media. She had made the remarks during the signing of coalition agreements between Kenya Kwanza and affiliate parties. In a tweet on Tuesday, the governor said it was just a slip of the tongue and her critics should stop making a big deal out of it. "Wacheni false hopes... My heart and soul are in UDA and Kenya Kwanza," she said. The Kirinyaga County Governor was forced to apologise to the Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders after the slip of the tongue. "Your excellency the Deputy President of Kenya, the party leader of UDA and the leader of the Azimio group... Sorry, my goodness," Waiguru said. She immediately clarified that she was thinking of chiding the Azimio outfit hence the slip of the tongue. "...And the leader of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, my sincere apologies, because I was thinking about what I will say about them." The incident generated a lot of buzz on social media as critics suggested that the incident was a testament that her heart was in Azimio. Waiguru is one of the leaders from the Mt Kenya region who backed the Building Bridges Initiative and ODM leader Raila Odinga before she changed her mind and teamed up with DP Ruto. She is also seen as a possible running mate for Ruto in the August 9 polls.
