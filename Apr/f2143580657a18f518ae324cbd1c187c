There was a commotion at the Cheptarit polling station, Chesumei constituency in Nandi county after voters demanded area Senator Samson Cherargei and a group of aspirants to also queue to cast their vote. This was during the United Democratic Alliance party nominations that were held across the country on Thursday. The Nandi Senator is reported to have stormed the polling station, in the company of his delegation and some aspirants, and attempted to walk straight to the polling room. Agitated residents who said they had queued as early as 5 am opposed the move and asked the leaders to also queue arguing that they also had errands to attend to. Cherargei, while speaking to the media, downplayed the incident saying he had no problem queuing. “I think everybody is impatient, people are tired since they woke up so early today,” Nandi Senator Kiprotich Arap Cherargei said. “I have no problem with queuing, in fact, we are queuing with other MPs and MCAs." The Senator, however,  raised concern that the centre deserved to have at least three polling stations owing to its huge number of voters. He said the one polling station was not enough to carry out the exercise effectively given the large turnout. “We need more ballot boxes, to enable smooth voting and accommodate all of the people who are in the local station,” a resident said. “We are only 3800 at this polling station, so does that mean we will spend a whole day here?” The Senator was later allowed to cast his votes at the station after confrontation ended.
