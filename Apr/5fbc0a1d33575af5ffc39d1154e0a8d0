@ppcheti Lamu department of livestock and veterinary services has rolled out a seven-day anti-rabies vaccination campaign targeting domestic dogs and cats. At least 6,000 dogs and cats are targeted in the exercise which started on Friday. Targeted areas include Witu, Hongwe, Baharini, Mkunumbi, Hindi, Faza, Mkomani, Shella, and Kiunga. Livestock chief officer Gichohi Mathenge said the move is vital. Mathenge said the viral disease is suspected to have spread to domestic animals during the prolonged drought which led to the infiltration of wild animals into human population areas in quest of water. “We ask the public to cooperate to enable us to achieve a successful and seamless campaign and vaccination exercise,” Gichohi said. He thanked members of the public who have already presented their domestic animals for vaccination. The officer said rabies is more prevalent in rural areas since dogs and cats are allowed to roam freely. “These dogs and cats are unlikely to be vaccinated on time since they rarely receive veterinary treatment and that’s why this exercise is necessary,” Gichohi said. According to the World Health Organization, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to people in up to 99 per cent of cases. However, rabies can infect both domestic and wild animals, and it is transmitted to humans and animals by bites or scratches, with saliva being the most common mode of transmission. The rabies virus attacks the brain and is 100 per cent lethal once symptoms show. Fever, headache, excessive salivation, muscle spasms, paralysis, and mental confusion are among the virus's symptoms, which are followed by coma and death within 14 days. Children under 15 years make up 40 per cent of those bitten by suspected animals.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
