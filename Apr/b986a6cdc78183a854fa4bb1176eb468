UDA supporters in Turkana East and Central are demanding an explanation as to why the nomination exercise was postponed. The supporters on Thursday said they were not informed of the postponement and had come out in large numbers to nominate their leaders. Rosemary Lokoloi, a resident of Lodwar, said she turned up at the polling station only to learn that the exercise had been postponed. "We have not been told why the nomination exercise is not taking place today. What's happening?" Lokoloi said UDA officials should tell them why the nomination exercise has been postponed in two subcounties. Joseph Longole, a resident of Lodwar, said the decision is meant to short change their effort of nominating leaders of their choice. "In other counties, the nomination exercise is ongoing. How come the Turkana one has been postponed overnight? Who is behind this plot?" he asked. Lodwar Township MCA aspirant Emmanuel Ekuwom said he is disappointed by the postponement because he spent a lot on mobilising his supporters. Turkana Central MP aspirant Joseph Namwar said he was informed of the postponement at 11am. He however said he’s ready for the scheduled nomination next week. UDA National Election Board member Rafael Chimera said the nomination exercise in Turkana East and Central has been postponed until next Tuesday. "We postponed the nomination exercise because of a few logistical challenges here and there," he said. Chimera said they are only conducting nomination exercises in Loima constituency.
