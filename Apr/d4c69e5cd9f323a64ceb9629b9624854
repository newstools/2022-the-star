Kenya Simbas prop Ian Njenga has been ruled out for the remainder of the Currie Cup and Rugby World Cup qualifiers after sustaining an Achilles injury. The Nondies' forward sustained the injury in training and underwent surgery in Cape Town, South Africa. He is expected to be sidelined for the next six months. Simbas head coach Paul Odera said: “He has been one of our consistent performers over the years and we wish him a quick recovery." Odera said there were concerns too on prop Andrew Simiyu, fullback Darwin Mukidza (wrist injury), flyhalf Jone Kubu (fatigue) and George Nyambua (heel injury) ahead of their third match of the Currie cup against high-flying Griffon on Saturday. “They will be assessed in the course of the next two days to see if they are ready for the encounter. If not, we will rotate our squad for the match,” added Simiyu. The former Strathmore Leos and Kenya under 20 coach hailed the mentality of his charges in their second match against Zimbabwe where they came from 17-0 down to lose 22-21. "Credit must go to the players. We never threw in the towel. We kept pushing and much as we fell short at the end, it was a gallant display,” noted Odera. Heading into the showdown against Griffons,  Odera said the side has to improve on their defence, especially chop tackle technique. "It's an area we struggled in against Zimbabwe where they were able to beat the gainline. However, we have worked on that in training this week." Odera said they have to improve on their game management too. “ When we brought the score to 17-13, the ball was charged down from the resultant kick-off. Going forward, we have to be better in those situations and manage to hold on to possession,” added Odera. The Simbas also lost their opening match a fortnight ago, going down 51-14 to Valke. The Simbas are using the Currie Cup as preparations for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers in France in July where they will face Uganda in the quarterfinals.
