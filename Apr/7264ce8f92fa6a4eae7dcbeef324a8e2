David Moyes criticised the supporter who ran onto the pitch and ruined a promising West Ham attack during his side's 1-1 Europa League draw with Lyon. Moyes said he was baffled by the incident which ruined a promising counter-attack. "This is a very good club, it's doing so many things to improve but those things today didn't help, certainly," Moyes said about Thursday's incident. Back in 2018, West Ham considered imposing life bans on two supporters who disrupted an EFL Cup tie against arch-rivals Tottenham by running on to the London Stadium pitch.
