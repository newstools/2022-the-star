A section of residents within the Kisumu Central constituency have called for peace amongst leaders and aspirants even as the ODM party primaries continue in some parts of the country. The locals cautioned youths against being sued to propagate chaos and violence within the city. They noted that Kisumu city is soon hosting the Africities summit which will see many local and international visitors troop in hence the need for peace to attract investors. “We are shocked by the videos going around on the social media by one ‘political broker’ that if the party does not award ticket to their candidate, then the county will be at a risk. Such statements are unfortunate and should not be entertained," Nyaori Nyang said. He added, “We feel that the Kisumu central constituency is a city constituency that can only thrive on peace and such utterances that are likely to cause mayhem must not be tolerated”. He said they are waiting for the direction from the National Elections Board because as it stands now, the party will hold its primaries on April 19. “We shall wait for the directions of the party moving forward and we shall not be part of any scenario that will lead to a breach of peace especially now that our party leader Raila Odinga needs a united backyard as he seeks the presidency," added Nyaori. A hawker within the city Millicent Akinyi also appealed for peace. He said women and children suffer most in chaotic circumstances. "Now that we are taking our Baba to State House, what else do we need and yet the statehouse is just within Kisumu central. Let’s all embrace peace”. Amina Swalle from Kaloleni called on the youths to stop being used to propagate chaos and cause violence. “Someone will call you and give you Sh300 or Sh500 but in the end, you go fight and get injured, you carry your burden alone,” she said.
