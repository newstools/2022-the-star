The vehicle of Kisii UDA deputy governor aspirant Ogamba Migosi was pelted with stones on Tuesday at Metembe area in Kitutu Chache North. Migosi is the running mate of Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu, who is seeking the governor seat. The rear window of the Toyota V8 Toyota car was smashed by suspected goons. Migosi's car was on the tail end of the convoy when the attack happened. However, he escaped unhurt and termed the attack barbaric. Machogu and Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, who is vying for senator, had already left the scene. Former Constitution Implementation Commission chairperson Charles Nyachae had also left the venue. Earlier, the rally went on smoothly with more than 3000 people in attendance. "We had even begun leaving the venue when some youth, who appeared drunk, emerged, blocked the road demanding for money. They pelted us with stones damaging the rear exit," Migosi said. Migosi urged for tolerance during the campaigns "We call upon all our people to be agents of peace," Migosi said. Kitutu Chache North is a flashpoint of political violence registering more than than three incidents of unrest. In a recent incident, the convoy politician Don Bosco Gichana was attacked during a rally and his aide injured. Another MP aspirant also reported destruction of his campaign materials a fortnight ago. During the rallies in Gesieka, Nyanchogu and Metembe, Machogu promised to fix water problems if he wins the sit. He also said they will employ more ECDE teachers and finish stalled projects. He heads to South Mugirango on Wednesday for a series of rallies before he storms Bobasi, the home to two aspirants, Chris Obure and Dagoreti North MP Simba Arati. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
