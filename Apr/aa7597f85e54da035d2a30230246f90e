Diamond Platnumz recently announced he is focusing on the global audience for his music. He is in London, where he is promoting his FOA EP, a project that came before his much-anticipated album. In an interview with BBC Swahili, Diamond said American superstar Rihanna is among the musicians who he wants to feature on his upcoming album. "I think Rihanna is someone I would want to work with. For some reason, I feel like we can have a masterpiece." Diamond added that his team and Rihanna's team are in talks and if she is not going to be featured in his forthcoming album due to her pregnancy, she will definitely be in the next. Diamond has previously worked with stars including Omarion, Alicia and Rick Ross.
