Bensoul's baby mama Tifanny Wanjiru has opened up about her relationship with the singer's girlfriend Noni Gathoni. Tifanny is expecting Bensoul's first child in four months. The two met at a concert last year. She told Word Is she is trying to make peace with both Bensoul and Noni. She revealed that it was Bensoul who gave her Noni's phone number to plan a private meeting. "Well, according to her, she has forgiven me and she also asked for my forgiveness over something she had done, and I think we are in a good place, though not on talking terms," she said. "I feel it is for the best for all of us to just keep to ourselves." After news of Bensoul's baby mama leaked, Noni Gathoni posted a cryptic message on her social media, suggesting that Tiffany 'hunted' for Bensoul. "M*alaya ni m*alaya tuu." Tifanny said during the meeting, Noni denied directing the message to her. "As I said, the statement was not directed at me, I just can't assume that it is me." Tiffany said she is on good terms with the 'Nairobi' hitmaker and they are strictly agreeing on how they are going to raise the child. Tiffany said she faced cyberbullying after the news hit the Internet. The worst was people wishing she lost her baby or even died. "People actually hoping that I miscarry and telling me I should die," she said. "For me, it is the audacity for someone to judge another. I do not want to play the victim but I do not think people should have opinions on the lives of others."
