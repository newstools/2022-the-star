Kitui Trade and investment executive Esther Kilonzi has urged voters to  reelect Governor Charity Ngilu for them to benefit more from her people based leadership style. Kilonzi on Thursday said Ngilu had not only steered Kitui to the path of insurmountable development and economic empowerment but also served all residents without fear of favour. “Governor Charity Ngilu is committed in serving her Kitui people without any favouritism in order to improve their lives. It is the reason you should re-elect her during forthcoming general election,” the executive said. She spoke when she represented Ngilu during the burial of  Mzee Eliud Mulei Kang’oti at Itoleka village in Kitui Central subcounty.  Kang’oti is the father-in-law to Kitui Deputy Governor Dr Wathe Nzau. Kilonzi said Ngilu had initiated many lifesaving projects that had turned around the lives of the majority of residents for the better. She said Ngilu’s performance could not be matched by those seeking to dethrone her. Former Kitui governor Julius Malombe, Former senator David Musila, former Kenyan’s High Commissioner to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo and former Nairobi deputy governor Jonathan Mueke are seeking to unseat Ngilu in the August 9 polls. “I urge our good people of Kitui not to be derailed or misled by her competitors who have no agenda for our county. You should instead avoid them like plague and vote Ngilu back because she has the well-being of  Kitui people at heart,” Kilonzi said. Dr Nzau and the Kyangwithya West Ward MCA  Boniface Katumo echoed Kilonzi’s sentiments  saying it would be prudent for Kitui people to vote Ngilu back to office to complete any unfinished projects as per her manifesto. The burial was also attended by the UDA senatorial aspirant Stephen Kilonzo, Vision Together Foundation CEO Patrick Mwendwa and Itoleka village administrator Winfred Syombua, among other leaders.   -Edited by SKanyara
