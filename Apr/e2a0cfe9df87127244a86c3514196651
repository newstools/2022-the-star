The environment agency has ordered  high rise property developers in Kisii to ensure proper waste disposal systems in their buildings. The National Environment Management Authority has accused some buildings said to be flouting waste disposal regulations. Many of these buildings wantonly discharge raw effluents into rivers at night. Other do so when it rains posing a danger to residents who use the water for domestic use, Nema board official Sam Nyangeso said. Traders at Daraja Mbili in Kisii and residents down stream are said to be in great danger following the discharge. "As an agency, we must rise to the occasion and addresses these grave concerns to stem a potential health crisis," Nyangeso said. He said it wrong for property owners to allow raw discharge of effluents into rivers. The agency, he said, is going to begin an intensive crackdown on any property that lacks proper sewage discharge mechanisms. He spoke at Bituka Seventh Day Adventist church in Getare in Kisii after a service. Nyangeso told congregants that the church has a special role to play to ensure the country conducts a peaceful election in August. "Praying for the country is not a preserve of the church. Without prayers, the country will head nowhere," he said. He also affirmed that while the state was making security plans to stem mayhem that often crops up during polls, the clergy and Christians can in their small way caution the people on the importance of keeping peace. "The government cannot do everything. God has entrusted to each one of us the responsibility of being a peace agent. Let each Kenyan be told that they are peace agents during and after these elections," Nyangeso said.   -Edited by SKanyara
