Ulinzi Starlets have not given up on the Kenya Women's Premier League title despite trailing runner way leaders Vihiga Queens by nine points. The much-hyped title decider last weekend between the two sides ended 1-1, giving three-time champions Vihiga an edge with nine games left. Vihiga have 35 points from a possible 39 having only drawn twice in this campaign. Ulinzi have 26 points despite losing once. Ulinzi coach Joseph Mwanza said in as much as they are playing catch up against their opponents, they are not relenting and will fight to the bitter end. "We are soldiers with a never say die spirit and not about to give up. You never know what might happen between now and the end of the season so every match is like a final for us," Mwanza remarked. He added: "Vihiga have the advantage but league title is not guaranteed. Our biggest undoing is the many draws we have registered but all is not lost. Vihiga have been a lucky team because some of their performances have not been impressive this season." Ulinzi signed up Wadadia captain Cindy Ngaira during the mid-season transfer window to beef up their midfield and she made her debut against Vihiga. Mwanza challenged Ngaira to fight for her position in order to become a regular player in the star-studded midfield. "Ngaira has the potential to become Kenya's finest midfielder. She's a good player and the management did all they could to have her on board. There's competition for places in midfield and she must be ready to learn and improve." He continued: "We have the bench power to help us win matches and I hope we can have a faultless run." Ulinzi take on Wadadia on Saturday.
