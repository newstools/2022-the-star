Nandi Governor Stephen Sang has taken an early lead in the UDA party gubernatorial nominations held on Thursday. The governor led in Aldai constituency home tuff. However, voters in Chesumei, Mosop and Aldai constituencies respectively voted out their sitting legislators in the primaries. MP's Wilson Kogo, Chesumei, Cornely Serem, Aldai, and Vincent Tuwei-Mosop lost in the UDA nominations marked with drama occasioned by delays. Preliminary results indicate that  Tindiret MP Julius Meli received a nod from his constituents for the third term on the UDA ticket. So far Meli, a DP William Ruto loyalist, became the only legislator tipped to represent the Tinderet constituency for the next 5 years. Maryanne Kitany, former chief of staff at the office of the Deputy President, is set to carry the UDA flag in Aldai. Eldoret based businessman Paul Biego beat Wilson Kogo while Abraham Kirwa beat Mp Vincent Tuwei. Nandi Hills constituency nominations were pushed to April 19, following the death of MP aspirant Wesley Kogo. He died in a road accident in Kangemi, Nairobi, while on his way to Kass Fm studios for interview. Developing story
