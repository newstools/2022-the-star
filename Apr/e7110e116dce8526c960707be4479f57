Singer Vivianne suffered a strange, 'spiritual' illness that made 'fake' friends steer clear of her in the entertainment industry. The chronic allergies left her face, lips and throat swollen, she says. Speaking to Mungai Eve, Vivianne said as she was trying to understand herself, the illness kept showing up. "During this period, I was trying to understand myself. Being in the industry for so long, you get to hear a lot of things," she narrated. "I was getting confused due to the different things people kept telling me. I think my mind was unwell, so my body started manifesting that illness." Vivianne said the allergy has since gone. "I think it was a good thing coz if my body did not become sick, maybe I would have continued doing my things. It then broke out in swelling. I hope it won't come back," she said. "I know myself better. It has helped me overcome that challenge and I hope God will keep me well and I will not face such an illness again." Vivianne has managed to remain relevant in the industry by knowing her purpose. "I am a deep thinker. I did not join the industry since I was doing nothing else," she said. "I was sharp in school and my grades were good. I have always tried to keep myself informed. There are times I have failed but I have never given up on my dream, it's just a miracle."
