As Kenyans pay their respects to the late president Mwai Kibaki who is lying in state, the family is also marking the death anniversary of his wife Lucy who died six years ago. Born on January 13 in 1936 in Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri County, Lucy was known for her tough stances, especially the day she stood beside Kibaki when he had to clarify he had only one wife. Kibaki had to address the nation to dismiss rumours that he had another wife. "This is my wife Lucy... I am married and have only one dear wife and everyone in Kenya knows it,” he said. Standing beside him, stone-faced, Lucy said, "Ask now or never, from here you go write more lies, I will be with you." The two met in 1959, and got married after two years in 1961. Their union was blessed with four children namely; Judy Wanjiku, Jimmy Kibaki, David Kagi and Tony Githinji. The former first lady died on April 26, 2016, at Bupa Cromwell Hospital in London. President Uhuru Kenyatta eulogised her as a role model in the fight against  HIV/Aids in Kenya. She was accorded a State funeral as the wife of the former president. Mwai Kibaki, on the other hand, died on April 22, 2022, at the age of 90. President Uhuru Kenyatta announced his death, adding that the ex-president's body will lie-in-state in Parliament for three days. He will be buried in Othaya, Nyeri County on April 30 and as such April 29 has been declared a public holiday. "We remember the values by which he lived, the ideals he embraced, his dignity and diligence, his candour and concern for the well being of all Kenyans," Uhuru said. He was the only surviving former president.
