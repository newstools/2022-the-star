Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed insists she will only engage with the world football governing body, Fifa, after getting rid of the mess in Kenyan football. Amina made the remarks after receiving the Cricket Normalization committee report at Moi International Sports Center, Kasarani on Wednesday. The hand over ceremony was graced by Joe Okudo, Principal Secretary, State Department for Sports, Joyce Aluoch Chair of Cricket Normalization Committee among others. The CS said she would unleash the magic wand that cleansed Cricket Kenya in a determined bid to exorcize the ghosts that have haunted the country's football for sometime now. Amina reckons Kenya has internal mechanisms of resolving the crisis that has rocked the local football scene and brought most activities to a halt. “We'll employ the model we used in addressing the mess in cricket to resolve the issues facing football. We want to adopt an internal approach and complete this process before engaging with Fifa,” Amina said. “If you have been following, FKF like most local federations has serious accountability issues which have to be addressed first,” she added. Amina was emphatic that the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Caretaker committee appointed in November last year, would complete its full term and execute its key mandate of streamlining Kenyan football. “We are keen on ensuring that FKF adheres to the Sports Act and the stipulated standards before we can think of sitting down with Fifa to discuss the possibility of lifting the suspension.” Amina reiterated her earlier position about the need to ensure all local federations have complied with the law requiring them to account for funds apportioned by government. “Many federations in the country need to put their house in order first. Most lack governance structures and yet still apply for government funding,” Amina said.
