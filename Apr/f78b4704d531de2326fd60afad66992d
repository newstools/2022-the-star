AC Milan coach Stefano Pioli called for calm as his Serie A league leaders look to claim their first Scudetto since 2011 this season, insisting that further twists and turns lie ahead. Milan are one point clear of Napoli in second ahead of their trip to Torino on Sunday, with champions Inter Milan three points further back. "There are no perfect teams," Pioli told a news conference on Saturday. "(Manchester) City had a 12-13 point lead over Liverpool (in the English Premier League), before tomorrow's match between them they are just one point ahead. "All teams experience moments of ups and downs, to be overcome with work. We have shown that we can overcome difficulties with teamwork, and that's what we have to focus on." Goals have been an issue for Milan of late, with Pioli's team scoring four times in their last six games in all competitions - something Pioli knows is becoming an issue. "The big numbers tell you something," he added. "We are aware that we need to improve in the finishing phase. We have tried to work on this with even more precision and effectiveness. "If we think too much about the previous game we don't prepare well for the next one. Games are unique, maybe tomorrow we won't get 30 shots on target, but we'll get three and score three goals. "I can't promise anything about not making the fans suffer in Turin, but we'll try to give them joy." Pioli also confirmed that Belgium international Alexis Saelemaekers will start in Turin having recovered from injury.
