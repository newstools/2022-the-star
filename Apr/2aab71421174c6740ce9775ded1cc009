UDA Party Electoral and Nomination Dispute Resolution Committee has handed Naivasha MP Jane Wanjiru Kihara the nomination certificate after the committee ascertained that she was the winner. Kihara had filed an appeal following the concluded party primaries in which aspirant John Karanja Kihagi was announced the winner. The committee said that failure to include the results of the Maua Primary School polling station and Milimani Secondary School polling station in the final tally had a significant bearing on the final outcome. The committee also found that failure to include the results of these polling stations in the final tally denied the Applicant a total of 29 votes. It also dismissed the claims from Karanja who had argued that non-inclusion was insignificant and had no bearing on the final result. "The Committee finds that the failure to include the results of Maua Primary School polling station and Milimani Secondary School polling station in the final tally had a significant bearing on the final outcome that overturns the results as announced by the Returning Officer for Naivasha constituency and rejects the assertion by Counsel for the 1st Respondent that their non-inclusion was insignificant and had no bearing on the final result." The committee added: "The Committee finds that when the results from the aforementioned polling stations are added to the final tally, which the Committee confirmed to be 9852 votes for the 1st Respondent and 9824 votes for the Applicant, the final result is that the 1st Respondent garnered 9,903 votes to the Applicant’s 9904 votes." Kihara will now be handed the UDA party ticket to contest for the seat in the August 9, polls. "In the upshot, the order that commends itself is an order directing the 2nd Respondent to forthwith issue a nomination certificate to Jane Wanjiru Kihara, the duly nominated Member of National Assembly (MNA) for Naivasha Constituency in Nakuru County."
