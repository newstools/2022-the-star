The burial service of Kenya's third President Mwai Kibaki set the stage for a political competition of some sort after supporters of ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto engaged in a cheering contest. As both Raila and Ruto made a walk into the tent, their supporters ushered them in with deafening cheers. President Uhuru Kenyatta was also welcomed with cheers. ODM leader was the first to walk into the tent and his supporters treated him to a warm reception. Odinga, in honour, removed his hat and waved his whisker three times at the former president's Kibaki's body three times, a Luo traditional way of paying respect to the dead. When Ruto took his turn to walk into the tent, he was also given a similar treatment by his supporters who cheered him loudly. The cheers however ended shortly as the master of a ceremony called for order as the service was about to begin. The family of the late Kibaki had asked politicians attending the burial ceremony not to engage in politics. However, the politicians found a way of sneaking their political agendas into their speeches on Friday, during a requiem mass. President Kibaki was announced dead on Friday, April 22, by President Uhuru. The country has since then observed a mourning period which will end on Saturday, April 30, when Kibaki will be laid to rest.
