A schoolboy on Thursday morning was found murdered and dumped at a boda boda base in Siaya town, Alego Usonga subcounty. He was strangled using a piece of cloth and his limbs tied with ropes. The boy was wearing brown school shorts. Alego Usonga deputy subcounty police commander Charles Odhiambo said they have launched investigations into the incident. He said after processing the crime scene, it appeared the minor had been killed elsewhere before the body was dumped where it was found. The body was taken to Siaya County Referral Hospital mortuary. The killing comes a fortnight after a student, Brian Ochieng' Odhiambo, 19, was abducted and killed in Uranga centre, in the same subcounty. Boncliffe Odhiambo, 20, from Pap Nyadiel village in Kogello was also found murdered a fortnight ago. Rights activists in Siaya, led by Odhiambo Ojiro, say police are not doing enough to put a stop to murders. "We are worried. The state of security and human rights in Siaya is wanting. How come every week people are killed in Siaya but police are not telling people what is happening?" Ojiro asked. Ojiro said the police should protect the lives and property of the people. He said the loss of human lives has been normalised, and urged the police to give updates on the state of investigations of previous deaths. Residents suspect the boy was abducted while on his way to school in the morning. "This is a small boy. It is wrong that teachers are insisting that children must go to school very early in the morning," resident Jane Atieno said. Edited by A.N
