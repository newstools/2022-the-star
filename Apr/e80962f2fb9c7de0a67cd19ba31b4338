Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) CEO Ezekiel Mutua has said that the term Sipangwingwi is not hate speech. The National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) had listed the term as hate speech and that it should be avoided during political campaigns. The phrase, borrowed from Sipangwingwi, a club banger by Exray ft Trio Mio and Ssaru, has been heavily used in rallies by several leaders. Speaking during an interview on TV47 on Saturday, Mutua said that the Sipangwingwi is one of the best songs by Kenyan artists. "Sipangwingwi is not hate speech, NCIC used 'hatupangwingwi' and I dare them to touch it," he said. Mutua further said he is going to fight piracy and distribute loyalty collected to musicians. NCIC recently released a list of Swahili, English and vernacular phrases which it said amounted to hate speech. The commission said the popular phrase sipangwingwi is among the phrases that contain coded hate speech. NCIC chairman Samuel Kobia said the words are banned in public rallies, social media posts and political talk shows. “This will go a long way in containing hate speech and ensuring our nation is secure during this electioneering period,” he said.
