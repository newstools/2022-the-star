The National Police have arrested three suspects allegedly involved in assaulting an old lady and her son on Monday in Homa Bay county. The arrest comes after the video clip where an old lady and a young man assumed to be her son being flogged by an unnamed aggressor went viral on social media attracting a public uproar. Police arrested Dedan Kimathi Agan, Enos Odhiambo Osoo and Lukio Okwiri following the incident. “Further, to an incident reported on Monday where an old lady with her son were assaulted by known persons, the suspects were arrested and are being processed to be arraigned," police said. The National Police Service condemned the act as unlawful and cruel. “The cruel act victimizing the two for whatever reason is unjustified, unlawful and cruel." The NPS noted that there are legally laid down procedures for settling conflicts between people. "The rule of law should always prevail against the rule of the mob in all situations". “Our local police are handling the matter. We shall therefore share the outcome of their findings in due course,” police said. Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has condemned the assault and vowed that the culprits will be brought to book. "This is intolerable gender violence. It doesn't matter what this woman did. I have asked the RC Nyanza and his security team to immediately hunt for the perpetrators and their crowd of onlookers and apprehend them so that an opportunity is set for them to face the law," he said.
