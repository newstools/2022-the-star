There will be a handshake between Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga after the August 9, polls, Chief Justice emeritus Willy Mutunga has opined. Speaking on Wednesday at the Sarova Panafric in Nairobi, Mutunga expressed fears that the status quo is likely to persist after the polls. "My view is that there will be a handshake between the two of them in August. So we will still have a dictatorship of the opposition and the government," he said. The remarks by Mutunga come at a time when the Handshake deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila is being blamed for government failures, especially by Ruto and his allies. The DP and his troops have fingered the Handshake as the main reason why the Jubilee government failed in implementing its development agenda. Ruto's open criticism of the Handshake raises eyebrows about whether he will opt to have one after the August 9, polls. Mutunga also appealed to ordinary citizens and leaders to stop fanning ethnic divisions in this electioneering period. "Our politics are ethnicized. Unless we deal with the divisions, we are not going to get anywhere," he said. The former CJ also raised concerns over the high debts Kenya owes lenders. "We don't own this country and if China or IMF tell us to leave where will you go?" he posed.
