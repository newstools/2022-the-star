The Umbrella hitmaker is currently expecting a baby with her boyfriend ASAP Rocky. In an interview for the May 2022 issue of U.S. Vogue magazine, Rihanna insisted that she has never once worn maternity clothing throughout her pregnancy. "When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, 'There's no way I'm going to go shopping in no maternity aisle. I'm sorry - it's too much fun to get dressed up. I'm not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing."
