Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir edged a thrilling sprint to the line to win the Boston Marathon on Monday, as fellow Kenyan Evans Chebet dominated a stellar field to win the men's race. With one mile remaining, Jepchirchir sprinted ahead of Ababel Yeshaneh but the Ethiopian refused to bow and retook the lead before the pair battled down the final stretch. Jepchirchir, who won in New York in November, needed every ounce of energy to break the tape in two hours 21 minutes and one second, four seconds ahead of her rival. "Above all, I was feeling she was strong and I pushed it, I feel I'm tired. I go behind, but I didn't lose hope," Jepchirchir told reporters. "The course is tough but thank God I managed to win the race." Kenyan Mary Ngugi finished third. Chebetpicked up his first major victory in two hours six minutes and 51 seconds, with compatriots Lawrence Cherono and Benson Kipruto second and third. A huge leading pack stuck together through 35 kilometres before Chebet pulled away, securing an 18-second advantage over 2019 winner Cherono with one mile left. The bells of the Old South Church rang and a roar came up from the crowd along Boylston Street as he ran towards the finish line. The race started in Hopkington in perfect conditions with temperatures hovering in the mid-50 degrees Fahrenheit (10°C) as the world’s oldest annual marathon returned to its traditional spring date for the first time in three years.
