The attackers on motorbikes stormed at least four remote villages on Sunday in Kanam area in the state, shooting people dead. Most of the victims were children. The gunmen also stole cattle and burnt down homes. Residents say at least 20 bodies have been found in the village of Gyambau while at least six have been recovered in the village of Kyaram. More killings were reported in the villages of Dungur and Kukawa. A number of people are still missing and hundreds have been displaced.
