A letter circulating on social media claiming Nairobi county assembly majority leader Abdi Hassan, alias Guyo, has resigned from Jubilee Party is fake. The letter indicates that Guyo has opted to run as an independent candidate for the Isiolo governor seat. “Kindly facilitate my resignation from Jubilee Party effective April 18, 2022. I have made the decision to run for the Isiolo governor seat as an independent and hereby request you to deregister me from the party,” the letter said. “My registration number is GNU304509. I wish Jubilee Party all the best in the upcoming election. Thank you in advance,” reads the letter. While dismissing the letter, Guyo said he had no intention of ditching Jubilee. “The letter purported to be from my office is FAKE. I have not and I don't intend to resign from Jubilee Party. Anyone spreading fake news will be held liable,” he said. Fact-check has verified that the letter is fake and did not originate from Guyo. Also, the header of the letter was written ‘Hon Abdi Guyo Ibrahim’, but the legislator only uses his official name, Abdi Ibrahim Hassan. Last month, Guyo received a huge boost after Governor Mohammed Kuti endorsed him for the Isiolo governor seat. Guyo said it was a difficult decision to make between Kuti’s endorsement and his political ambitions in Nairobi. The 41-year-old city politician had last year in November announced his candidature for Embakasi Central MP seat. He was running for the parliamentary seat under the Jubilee Party ticket and had even paid the nomination fee. But after Kuti's endorsement, he abandoned city politics. Guyo has served as Matopeni MCA for almost 15 years.
