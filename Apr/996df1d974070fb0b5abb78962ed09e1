The United Nations General Assembly has officially voted to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council. The vote on Thursday local time saw 93 countries in favour, 24 against and 58 abstentions. The draft resolution says the General Assembly will “suspend the rights of membership in the Human Rights Council of a member of the Council that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights". Russia has condemned the move saying it is politically motivated. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said they would stand firm to protect their values.
