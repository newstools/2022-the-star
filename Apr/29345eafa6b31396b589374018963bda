Ex- Petroleum and Mining Cabinet Administrative Secretary John Mosonik has not quit the UDA Bomet Governor seat primaries. The Governor Aspirant denied misleading reports indicating that he had bolted out of the race faulting his rivals for the propaganda. He has urged his followers to ignore the reports and turn up in large numbers to vote for him on Thursday primaries. "I am firmly in the race for the Bomet Governor seat. Ignore reports indicating that I have quit. I urge my supporters to turn up tomorrow and finish the job we started," Mosonik told the star. Mosonik, who has put a spirited campaign to win the seat said he is certain that he will win the UDA primaries set for Thursday. Mosonik will face off with the Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok for the UDA party ticket. Rift valley has turned out to be a competitive zone for the UDA primaries with political pundits saying the winner of the primaries is likely to win the August 9, polls.
