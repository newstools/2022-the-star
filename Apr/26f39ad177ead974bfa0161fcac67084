The clergy leading former President Mwai Kibaki's requiem mass comforted the congregation with the wisdom of Solomon. Drawing the words from the book of Wisdom, believed to have been authored by King Solomon, Catholic archbishop Phillip Anyolo reminded Kenyans that death is but a relief from sinful ways of life; a reward in fact. The book which some scholars claim is an extension of the book of Hebrews offers a pious philosophy that the quality of life matters more than how long the man lives. "The age you die doesn't matter, what matters is how you live your life, what legacy you leave behind. Such was the life of the former president Kibaki," said Anyolo. The book notes that no matter the pain or suffering people feel when we lose a loved one, it cannot be compared with the peace that comes after death. “They seemed in the eyes of the foolish, to be dead, and their passing away was thought an affliction… but they are in peace,” it reads. Archbishop Anyolo explained that though in the sight of the living, they may have been seen to undergo great suffering but their hopes were in a future life that could not be taken from them. The bishop also reminded the congregants with reference to Romans 8: 14-23, that absolutely everything works together for the good of those who love God. "If God is on our side, what have we to fear from those who are against us? And suffering in our lives is no indication that God is not with us," he read. The clergy also urged Kenyans to remain peaceful during the electioneering period and to be tolerant to each other.
