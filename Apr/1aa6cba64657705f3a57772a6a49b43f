Chaos continues to reign at many petrol stations across the country as motorists move from one facility to another in search of the now rare crucial commodity. Apart from the frustration of looking for fuel, arguments have broken out in some cases as motorists wait in the long queue that have spilt onto the roads, disrupting traffic in many major urban centres. The fuel shortage has lasted more than three weeks. It started after oil marketers held back imports of fuel to demand subsidy payments from the government. Despite the President signing the supplementary budget, the crisis has persisted and it's hurting the economy. Numerous independent fuel stations have increased the pump price of petrol, higher than the official price per litre, with the Easter weekend around the corner. The situation is grinding the economy to a halt. Kenyans are spending many working hours in search of petroleum products to power their businesses at exorbitant cost to the economy. The fuel crisis will also negatively affect GDP growth. The state needs to take immediate steps to end the crisis.
