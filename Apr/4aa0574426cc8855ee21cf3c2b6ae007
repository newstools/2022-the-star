Two thugs who had attacked a man have been killed as they escaped from the scene of the incident in Njiru, Nairobi County. The two were killed on Wednesday night by police officers, DCI director George Kinoti said. The two who were part of a six-man gang that has been terrorising residents in the larger Kayole area. "They had just knifed a man who was walking home leaving him sprawled on the ground in a pool of blood after taking away the victim’s mobile phone and other valuables,"Kinoti said. Kinoti said the six walked away casually towards an alley in Zanaki area, as members of the public who had witnessed the daring attack raised alarm. "Luckily, two officers based at Soweto police station who were on foot patrol responded to the distress calls on time, as the boisterous gang took leave casually, having accomplished their mission," he said. "They came face to face with two officers compelling the thugs to immediately open fire sending the officers on prone position, as they responded to the provocation in equal measure. " Kinoti said as the two robbers died, four accomplices fled the scene heavily inflicted with gunshot injuries. One gun and a bloodstained knife was recovered from the suspects. The injured man was rushed to the hospital as bodies of the thugs were moved to the city mortuary pending identification. Kinoti said they are looking for the four suspects who escaped.
