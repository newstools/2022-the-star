In order to earn the right to mate with the female, the males will fight each other. These fights can be brutal, and injuries are common. Occasionally, the male rhino may attack the calf in the hit of the moment. When rhinos in one area reach the maximum carrying capacity, they also start to get aggressive fighting with one another because of lack of space.
