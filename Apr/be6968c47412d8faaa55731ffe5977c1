Rangers coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst hailed his side's character after they played 120 minutes for a second straight match to beat Celtic 2-1 and reach the Scottish Cup final. The victory, which ended their Glasgow rivals' hopes of a fifth domestic treble in six seasons, came after Rangers required extra time to beat Portuguese side Braga on Thursday to reach the Europa League semi-finals. "I'm feeling pretty good and very proud," Van Bronckhorst told Premier Sports. "It's been a busy week for us, very demanding physically and mentally, and to play two times extra time within four days, the players were magnificent. "The players showed a lot of character, drive and belief to reach the cup final. We had to dig deep and had to change many players but we did it as a team and are very proud to be in the final." Carl Starfelt's own goal capped a comeback win for Rangers after Greg Taylor gave Celtic the lead and Scott Arfield levelled in the 78th minute. Celtic, who have already won the League Cup, remain favourites for the Premiership title with a six-point lead over Rangers. "We've got five games to be champions of this country and that doesn't change after today," Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou said. "Our focus has to be that we make sure we use this disappointment to fuel what is going to happen in the next few games."
