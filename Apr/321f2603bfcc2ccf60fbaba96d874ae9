After five years of construction and planning, the LEGO Group have officially opened their state-of-the-art Campus at its headquarters in Billund, Denmark. The campus spans 54,000 square metres creating an innovative workplace for around 2000 people. The Campus has been designed to provide a playful, inclusive, and collaborative environment that enables employees to develop the best play experiences for children all over the world. It features a state-of-the-art fitness studio, creative workshop space, cinema, outside park and activity zone, kitchen for communal cooking and networking and a health clinic. “It’s a great moment to see our new Campus officially open after many years of planning and construction,” CEO of the LEGO Group Niels B.
