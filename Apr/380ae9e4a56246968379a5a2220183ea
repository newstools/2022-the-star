Nigerian superstar Davido is in a relationship months after splitting with his baby mama Chioma. Davido made the announcement in a social media post after his record label signee and friend Peruzzi said his friends are single. "All my niggas single. Damn," Peruzzi wrote on Instagram. Davido posted in the comments section: "Me I’m not." Davido and his baby mama Chioma broke up in February last year after he allegedly cheated on her with a model. In October, Davido and Chioma were spotted at their son’s birthday party. Davido is set to perform in Kenya next month. This will not be the first time Davido will be performing in the 254. The last time was during the much-hyped 30 Billion World Tour Concert that was held at Uhuru Gardens on November 24, 2018.
