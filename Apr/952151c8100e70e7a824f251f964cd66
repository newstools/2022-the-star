Parkroad Badgers are looking to build on their 1-0 win against Mombasa Sports Club when they take on Sailors in their next match this weekend. Badgers recorded their first win of the season in four matches, pipping the coastal side via Ian Oyale’s fourth-minute goal. David Omwaka’s Parkroad have lost their past two matches by three-goal margins, against Greensharks and Butali, in addition to falling 2-1 to Strathmore Scorpions, losing to the students. “We played so well today (Sunday) and we have to build on that. Our young players rose to the occasion. They are slowly adapting to the demands of the league. Short corner execution was excellent and this will help us approach the match against the Sailors with confidence,” Omwaka said. “However, there’s still work to be done especially in midfield and attack.” This was MSC’s fourth consecutive loss. Both sides returned to the league this season but the going has been tough thus far with inexperience cited as the main reason for their slow starts. MSC lost 4-3 against Gladiators and 3-0 against Kenya Police at the City Park Stadium. Though they limited the damage in their home matches, they lost by a solitary goal to both Sailors (Saturday) and Badgers (Sunday). In the men’s Super League, Technical University of Kenya TUK slayed Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology 3-1. Deogratius Odhiambo sounded the board in the 26th minute to give TUK the lead. Moses Obushuru doubled the lead three minutes later before completing his brace in the 38th minute. Anthony Ojwang’s 49th minute strike was just a consolation for JKUAT.
