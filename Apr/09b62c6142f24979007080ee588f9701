The Communications Authority (CA) has clarified that the directive to register mobile lines will only affect unregistered lines and not all users of the various network service providers as presumed before. The clarification comes in the wake of long queues witnessed in various mobile line dealers' shops across the country where Kenyans trooped for registration. CA Director General, Ezra Chiloba said Kenyans can confirm their registration details by dialling *106# without having to make visits to agents or other certified outlets. Those who find that they have been registered have been advised to carry on with their usual business. The regulator had urged mostly subscribers with SIM cards for more than 10 years to visit their providers to update their data. It, however, indicated that most operators have recorded impressive compliance in the past four years. Chiloba had already ordered all mobile network operators to speed up the data cleanup exercise, adding that no more time will be added. The SIM registration exercise has seen a section of Kenyans raise concerns about its necessity considering that they provided the necessary information while registering their SIM cards for the first time. A petition had already been filed seeking to block the exercise whose deadline has been slated for April 15.
