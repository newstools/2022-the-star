TikTok has remained the most downloaded application on both Google and the App store, as every app needs the interests of its users to remain afloat. The app is making more updates to suit the interests of different types of people, including gamers. TikTok announced that it is adding a live gaming feature that will enable users to go live and play games, just like Facebook and YouTube. According to a tweet by Matt Navarra, who is a social media analyst, this feature will be rolled out soon and those who violate the feature for other than gaming, like streaming movies, will have the right taken away.
