A man has been arrested while transporting bhang along the busy Nairobi – Mombasa highway. Caan Yaah 27, was locked up at Mtito Andei police station following a successful chase by the officers after he attempted to evade arrest by speeding off. Makueni county police commander Joseph Ole Naipeyan said they were in hot pursuit of a second suspect who escaped during the incident. Two motor vehicles were impounded and bhang worth more than Sh1.3 million was seized. Napeiyan said the car’s occupant stopped and fled into Tsavo National Park after the chase. “On checking the motor – vehicle, police found thousands of bhang in sticks packed in bags,” the police boss said. He said Kenya Wildlife Service command was informed and that they assisted in Ariel search using a helicopter and sniffer dogs. Yaah was later interrogated and disclosed that they normally collect the said cannabis sativa from a certain estate within Nairobi county.
