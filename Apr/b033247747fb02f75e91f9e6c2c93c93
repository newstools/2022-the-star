Linet Chepkorir, the youngest candidate eyeing the UDA ticket in the race for Bomet woman representative seat, has emerged victorious. Chepkorir defied all odds and put up a spirited fight throughout her campaigns for the UDA ticket, which attracted 10 other aspirants. She won with 53,934 votes, followed by Eunice Benson 27,711, Stacey Chepkemoi 26,808, Beatrice Tonui 20,495, Cecilia Mutai 16,644, Susan Koech 12,410 and Brenda Chepngetich 11,901. Her other competitors included Joan Towett and Faith Chepkirui. Chepkorir, ordinarily referred to as ‘Toto’, shot to fame during an aspirants’ meeting at Deputy President William Ruto’s Karen residence in early 2021. She was clad in a yellow pullover and a cap and her photo went viral on social media. She later got a major boost during Ruto’s rally at Bomet Green stadium when she was recognised and given the opportunity to address the crowd. Since then, Chepkorir continued to enjoy overwhelming support from across the county and especially from the youth. The 24-year-old Chuka University graduate has had to grapple with financial challenges throughout the campaign period. She relied on friends and well-wishers to support her political ambitions. She graduated with a degree in procurement last year. During a past interview with the Star, Chepkorir, the thirdborn in a family of seven, said she has had leadership skills right from a tender age, having served in various positions. “I decided to join politics and run for this seat because it has always been my dream to serve people,” she said. She said her main agenda once elected is to pursue the youth and women agenda. “As a lady and having stayed with my mother at home for long, I know the challenges that women go through and my focus will be to support them with available resources allocated to the office,” she said.
