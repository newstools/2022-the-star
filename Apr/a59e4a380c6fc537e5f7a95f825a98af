The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has said it will refer the case on election rigging claims against MPs Moses Kuria and Sabina Chege to the office of the public prosecutions.

But with the court annulling it's role, he said, his commission will just do exhaustive investigation of the cases and then collaborate with Haji's office to have the accused persons prosecuted in court. The commission has accused Kuria and Chege of breaching the code of conduct by making claims over election rigging.
