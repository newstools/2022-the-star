A look at the game of the weekend as the Premier League's top two fought out a thrilling draw at the Etihad Stadium. Man City and Liverpool will be thinking of what might have been as the sides remain just one point apart at the top of the league. An explosive first half saw City go into half-time with a 2-1 lead over Liverpool, but the Reds equalised through Sadio Mane just 46 seconds into the second half. A win at Etihad Stadium would have taken the defending champions four points clear and made them firm favourites for a sixth title in 11 years.
