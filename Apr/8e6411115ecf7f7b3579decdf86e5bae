A viral video showing  Kenya's third President Emilio Mwai Kibaki's grandson 'snubbing ODM leader Raila Odinga's handshake' is edited. The fake video has been going viral on social media misleading a section of Kenyans. Those who shared it claimed the grandson refused to shake hands with the ODM leader. Fact-checker has however established the video has been edited for a motive yet to be established. The fact-checker has discovered that the grandson greeted the former prime minister and it was after they shook hands that he turned his back. The part where he shook Raila's hands was omitted in the fake video. On Saturday, more than ten thousand Kenyans thronged the Othaya Approved School grounds where the burial service was being held at. Kibaki’s final send-off attracted senior national and county government officials. President Uhuru Kenyatta led a host of officials at the function. His deputy president William Ruto was also present. ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper Kalonzo Musyoko and other leaders were also present.
