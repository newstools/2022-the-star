Kenya Lionesses got off to an indifferent start at the Africa Cup Sevens Championship in Jemmie, Tunisia Dennis Mwanja's charges beat Zambia 22-0 in their opening match but lost 10-7 to Uganda in a physical encounter. In the Migingo derby, the Lionesses were guilty of several handling errors and ill-discipline resulting in Linet Moraa being sent off after accumulating two yellow cards. The Ugandans started brightly, capitalising on handling errors to score through Charlotte Mudoola for an unconverted try and a 5-0 lead. Kenya regrouped and dominated possession briefly and Grace Odhiambo showed the Ugandans a clean pair of heels to touch down for a centre post try which she converted for a 7-5 lead The Lionesses were punished a minute later for not protecting the ball from a ruck as Yvonne Najjuma scored an unconverted try at the corner for a 10-7 lead at the interval. On resumption, Kenya dominated possession but handling errors proved costly in a topsy-turvy encounter. Matters went from bad to worse with Judith Auma sin-binned for indiscretions at the ruck, reducing Kenya to six players before Moraa saw her marching orders and consequently saw the Lionesses finish the game with six players. Earlier Dorcas Sinaida scored twice as Kenya ran riot, thrashing Zambia 22-0 with Janet Okello and Stella Wafula scoring a try each. The Lionesses led 15-0 at the interval. The tournament continues Saturday with the winners sealing an automatic qualification slot to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England in July while two teams join South Africa for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town in September.
