Working for Depp's legal team amid the ongoing court battle between the actor and his ex-wife Heard Forensic psychologist Dr. Shannon Curry took the stand to give evidence against Heard's claim that Depp was abusive during their marriage between 2015 and 2016. Curry claimed Heard has borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder, reports Buzzfeed News. Curry based her claims on several mentalhealth tests Heard took during their meetings, which totalled 12 hours, last December. Justifying her diagnosis, Curry said histrionic personality disorder manifests as "impressionistic speech - so it tends to be very flowery”.
