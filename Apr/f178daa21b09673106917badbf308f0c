Open Class leader Rajveer Thethy has pronounced himself ready for the fourth round of the Kenya National Autocross Championship slated for Twisty Corners racetrack in Kiambu on Sunday. The soft-spoken driver will renew track rivalry with his dad Charan Thethy who sits second on the log after the first three races. Asked what he expects at Kiambu’s Twisty Corners racetrack, Thethy Jr replied: “Who knows what the weather is going to be?  Current torrential rains could make the race exciting but somewhat slippery and challenging.” He added: “Preparations are going on well. We have made a few modifications to the car and improved the suspension for better handling on the track. Our approach for this weekend is to keep it clean and set good timings in order to keep my opponents at bay.” Meanwhile, drivers will be fighting for a share of championship points in their respective classes. The 2WD non-Turbo Junior Class leader Neel Gohil will take on Amaan Ganatra, Yuvraj Rajput and Amraj Malle. Gurraj Singh is the man to beat in the 2WD non-turbo class. He will be up against Manveer Ghale, Ankush Shah, and Rahul Patel. Bambino class leader Karamveer Singh Rooprai will renew his rivalry with Kiana Rajput, Eann Bengi, and Saad Shamil Farouq. Autocross Round 4 is being organized by Sikh Union Club Nairobi. The event will run in compliance with the national competition rules of the Kenya Motorsports Federation.
