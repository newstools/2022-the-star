A suspected thug who attacked and robbed a policewoman of her uniform and other valuables last week on Tuesday made a daring escape from police custody. Daniel Kimani and two other suspects escaped from the highly guarded Mombasa law courts basement cells, hours after they were charged with robbery with violence on Monday evening. His two other accomplices were Mokoya Mosioma and Hussein Abdhalla Mohammed. According to police reports, Kimani had attacked policewoman Saadia Abdi, who is based at Makupa police station on Tuesday morning last week. Abdi was walking to a matatu stage to connect to work. The thug made off with Abdi’s Persian blue police shirt and other belongings at 5.30am. On Sunday night, during a crackdown by a special team of police officers in Changamwe, the officers nabbed Kimani in Magongo Mwisho area. On searching his house, the officers recovered the police uniform bearing Abdi’s police number. He and the two other escaped suspects were taken to Changamwe police station. On Monday, the trio was charged with robbery with violence at a Mombasa court. However, in the evening as police officers were planning to return the suspects to the police station, the three were missing from the basement cells. “It was reported by the officer in charge of Mombasa court, Orderly Sergeant Robert Musee, that the three prisoners, who were in custody in the underground cells within the court premises had escaped by first sliding underneath the raised cell doors,” the police report read. Police sources said the three pulled out a rusted bar from the bottom of the grille door and escaped through empty courtrooms. At the time of the escape, two court orderlies, Bernard Magende and Kipkoech Bii, who were on duty and in the process of handing over, noticed the three had escaped. (Edited by V. Graham)
