Iconic city hotel, The Hilton, will close its doors indefinitely in December after operating for over five decades in the heart of Kenya's Central Business District. As a result, it will lay off an unspecified number of workers, underlining the troubles of hotels in the wake of the Covid-19 travel slump and other factors beyond the pandemic. The renowned hotel, which has 40.57 per cent shares owned by the government said on Wednesday it will not quit Kenya and will continue to operate its other brands in the country. “Following extensive discussions with the hotel ownership, Hilton Nairobi will close its doors for the last time on December 31, 2022, and cease operations,” a Hilton spokesperson told the Business Daily in an interview. It began operations in Nairobi on December 17, 1969, and was officially opened by Kenya’s founding President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. At inception, Hilton was the tallest building in Nairobi and a popular base for tourists to Kenya seeking adventures in the country’s famed game parks and reserves. The hotel promised tourists unique city views from its high-rise tower rooms and was a popular hangout for wealthy businessmen and tourists. It has 287 rooms, 45 twins, 185 doubles, seven suites, 22 pool rooms and 27 executive rooms.
