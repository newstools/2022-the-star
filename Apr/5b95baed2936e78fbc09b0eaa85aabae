Media personality Waihiga Mwaura and his wife Joyce Omondi are mourning the death of his sister Gathoni Mwaura. The news of the death was shared by Joyce Omondi, who is Gathoni's sister-in-law. "I feel numb and speechless. It's incredibly difficult trying to accept that our tender-hearted, witty, beautiful little sister, Gathoni, is suddenly no longer with us," she wrote on Instagram, adding that she had never imagined such a loss. "Oh Lord, we fix our eyes on You. Our risen King, only You, your unfailing love and sufficient grace are the answer to this pain and sorrow." This comes a year after Joyce lost her father, who had been battling a long illness after surviving the 1998 bomb blast in Nairobi.
