The UDA party has postponed nominations in several regions after the excised was disrupted by supporters. UDA election board chairman Antony Mwaura said the Board has postponed primaries in Bumula, Kakamega County, Mt Elgon and parts of Turkana. In Mt Elgon, Mwaura said the exercise was called off after youths barricaded roads blocking vehicles that were ferrying election materials. He said the primaries in Kakamega and Mt Elgon will be conducted on Friday. Meanwhile, the NEB chairman said areas where voting delayed or started late due to acts of violence or logistical challenges will be given more time. He confirmed that the party has witnessed incidences where ballot papers were destroyed by unruly supporters and some polling stations opened late. He cited Bomet where voting materials for four polling stations were destroyed and Embu where materials were burnt. "In Kisii we had shortage of ballot papers but that has been sorted," Mwaura told journalists at Hustlers Center in Nairobi. He said that the party's disciplinary committee has already summoned three aspirants linked to the fracas in Embu. Mwaura, however, affirmed that the UDA election board is satisfied with the ongoing party primaries countywide despite the chaotic incidences in the mentioned areas.
