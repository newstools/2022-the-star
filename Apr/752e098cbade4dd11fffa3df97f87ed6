Former  Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has no capacity to unseat the incumbent county boss Wilber Ottichilo, says Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi. Agoi said Akaranga had all the resources while in office to retain the seat but he lost it. The MP was addressing the press on Sunday at the Vihiga resource centre in the Vihiga constituency. The lawmaker urged his supporters to ignore social media propaganda indicating that there are plans for him to step down for the former Governor Moses Akaranga in the forthcoming general elections. Agoi said stepping down for Akaranga is a waste of time because he had all the resources to defend the seat but he failed. “How can I step aside to someone who gave out the seat willingly to someone else?” Agoi questioned. “If it's money and political machinery, Akaranga had but he failed to clinch the seat." Agoi was reacting to letters that were circulating on social media that he had stepped down for Akaranga in the forthcoming general elections. Previously, similar information emerged on social media claiming that Akaranga had stepped down for Agoi. The former governor dismissed the statement. The lawmaker further blasted the UDP gubernatorial aspirant and area senator George Khaniri saying he has contributed largely to the downfall of Vihiga County by failing to play his oversight role. “Khaniri was elected as the Vihiga county senator twice to perform the oversight roles. He can't come here to tell us how the two governors have failed to deliver when he failed to keep them on toes,” Agoi said. He said Khaniri was to ensure Vihiga people get quality services from the devolved unit through the allocation they are getting from the treasury. Agoi has joined the governor race under Kenya Kwanza Alliance and he is set to face off the incumbent Wilber Ottichilo, Former Governor Moses Akaranga, Senator George Khaniri, Vihiga Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi, and former Speaker of the National Assembly Keneth Marende.
