The ruling Jubilee party is said to have settled on former  Equity Chief Commercial Officer Polycarp Igathe as its candidate for the Nairobi governor seat. Sources privy to the developments confided to the Star that Igathe is now likely to be unveiled as the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya alliance candidate for City's top seat. "Jubilee looked at all applicants and decided Igathe is the best and the party will now ask the Azimio affiliates parties to support him," a senior Jubilee official told the Star. This comes hours after Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi said the coalition will name its flagbearer on Thursday. Wanyonyi said the party has been holding talks on who to from the county's top job. The two-term MP earlier confirmed to the Star that he held a meeting at State House on Tuesday morning. He said the agenda of the meeting was pegged on Nairobi succession politics. “I can't confirm in detail about the meeting but I can assure you it's about Nairobi politics and the gubernatorial race,” a source, who sought anonymity, told the Star. Sources close to the Westlands MP say he will on Wednesday issued a statement following the new developments. The endorsement of Igathe for the City's top seat is likely to cause political cracks in the Azimio Coalition owing to the spirited fight put by other aspirants eyeing the Governor seat. Jubilee aspirants eyeing the governor ticket include Richard Ngatia, businesswoman Agnes Kagure and  Nairobi governor Anne Kananu. Wanyonyi is seeking the ODM ticket for the governor seat.
