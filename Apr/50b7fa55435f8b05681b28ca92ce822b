Agriculture CS Peter Munya’s former aide Samuel Gikundi Ntuara is making a second stab at Tigania East MP post. In 2017, he lost to incumbent Josphat Gichunge and EALA MP Mpuru Aburi who came second. He believes his experience as Munya’s PA when he was a legislator and working as a CDF manager will make him a good MP. “I worked under Munya for seven years. I familiarised myself with what is required, running the CDF office and even drafting motions,” Ntuara said on Wednesday. He also holds a Masters Degree in project planning and management. The aspirant said if elected, he will prioritise roads and make earth roads accessible in all weather, adding that Kerra had done shoddy work in the constituency. Ntuara said he will also table a motion to hold Kerra and Kura accountable for poor road works. “I would rather we do fewer roads than do more that are deplorable.” He also said state jobs are marred by corruption during recruitment and some areas lack representation. “I will source for jobs especially for teachers.” Ntuara said the government should help miraa farmers do value addition to save their dwindling fortunes. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta had a great vision but the modes of implementation is what is making Kenyans feel the pinch. The aspirant said taxes are to be blamed on the high cost of living, adding that fuel was not zero rated by Parliament. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
