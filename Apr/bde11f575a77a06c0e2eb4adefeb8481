A sex worker who allegedly stole a laptop and two mobile phones valued at Sh347,000 from a motorist along Koinange street has been charged. Sheila Anyango alias Stella appeared before Milimani Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo to face charges of stealing one black backpack bag, an HP Spectra laptop and two mobile phones (iPhone 12 Pro max and Samsung Galaxy) from a man. The court heard that she allegedly committed the offence on April 9, 2022, along Koinange Street in Nairobi, jointly with others not before the court. According to the police, the motorist was driving along Koinange Street when he stopped and talked to one of the girls. He was immediately thereafter approached by two other sex workers who entered his vehicle forcefully and started demanding money from him. The woman and the accused allegedly took the items and walked away demanding money in exchange for the items. Anyango, however, denied the charges and told the court that she was not part of the trio that robbed the complainant, even though she saw them get into a car. Anyango told the court that she was arrested a week after the alleged incident and told the arresting officers she was there when the three ladies got into the complainant’s vehicle but she was not part of it. She said she could identify them since they work in the same locality. The magistrate said her claims would form part of her defence and released her on a cash bail of Sh 100,000. The case will be mentioned on May 2.
