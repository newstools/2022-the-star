Emoji reactions have become quite a popular feature across a range of social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Microsoft Teams, and now Google’s word document. Last year, Google revealed that it was planning to bring emoji reactions to its most popular platform, Google Docs. Users will now be able to leave an emoji beneath a word or series of words while offering a less formal alternative to comments to express their opinions about document content. Google announced the feature will be available for all Google Workspace customers, as well as legacy G Suite Basic and Business customers and users with personal Google Accounts. However, it will not be available to Enterprise Essentials, Education Fundamentals, Frontline, and Non-profits, as well as G Suite Basic and Business customers. Though the feature had already been rolled out on April 5, Google has said it will be available to all Google Docs users by April 20.
