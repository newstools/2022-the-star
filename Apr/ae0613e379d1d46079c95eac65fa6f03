The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of “horrific” abuses – raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russia’s own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. "War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history," Kuleba said. More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UN’s Human Rights Council during a session in New York.
