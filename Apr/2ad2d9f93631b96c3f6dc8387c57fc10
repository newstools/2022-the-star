When Mark, 26, found out his friend had taken his own life, he turned to running as a coping mechanism. But it took over - and Mark says he’d “be out running before I even realised I was doing it”. He created it as a safety bubble – then couldn’t get out: “I couldn’t figure out any other way of coping with anything.” It was only when he spoke out about his depression that his relationship with running went back to normal. He says: “My identity was built around me being a runner. Now I’d say I’m someone who runs.”
