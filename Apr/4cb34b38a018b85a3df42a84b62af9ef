Mombasa businessman Suleiman Shabhal has dropped his gubernatorial bid in favour of Mvita MP Abdulswanad Shariff Nassir. According to the ODM party, Shabhal's decision was informed by the need to have a united party, ahead of the polls. "He says his decision was informed by the fact that he believes in a United ODM in Mombasa. He says he will campaign for the party ahead of the 9/8 elections," the ODM party tweeted on Friday. The two leaders who both eyed the Orange party ticket for the Coastal city county said they will work together to secure victory for the ODM boss. The Mvita MP thanked Shabhal for shelving his ambitions to support him, adding that it was in the interest of the party. “We shall merge our manifestos and campaign together,” he said. Nassir will now face UDA's Hassan Omar who was handed a direct ticket. ODM leader Raila Odinga who was present during the annoucing of the decision appreciated businessman Shabhal, describing his decision as an act of bravery and loyalty to the Orange party. “I want to thank Hon. Shabhal for taking this bold decision.” The ODM primaries had threatened to bring division in the party as a section of aspirants claimed favoritism in handing of certificates.
