Two suspects have been arrested for defiling a student at Eldoret National Polytechnic. The DCI said the 20-year-olds, K K and E K, defiled a girl on March 6 after they gained entry into her room in Langas. The suspects, who were armed with a machete and a rungu, ransacked the room and commanded the woman to carry the items to an awaiting Toyota probox before raping her. Police said the two suspects, a week before the incident, defiled a 16-year-old girl. The duo broke into the minor’s family home, dragged her outside and defiled her in turns. DCI said the two suspects were responsible for the recent spate of robberies, defilement and rape cases reported in Kapsaret, Uasin Gishu county. "We have been in pursuit of the two machete-wielding criminals who had turned the lives of residents living in Langas and its environs a nightmare,” the DCI said. The early morning raid conducted by detectives based at Uasin Gishu county headquarters recovered several stolen valuables. J K, a third suspect who is a recipient of the stolen electronic goods, was also arrested in the swoop. The arrests comes a week after police in Sotik, Bomet county, apprehended a senior principal magistrate over defilement allegations. The senior judicial officer was arrested on Thursday night at a lodging within Kaplong, while in the company of a 17-year-old girl. Bomet county police commander Esther Seroney told the Star DCI detectives from Sotik were probing the matter. "I can confirm that he is in our custody and investigations have begun," she said on Friday. The police boss said the magistrate will be arraigned once investigations are complete. "We are carrying out investigations to ascertain the allegations." The three suspects are currently in custody at Eldoret Central police station awaiting arraignment.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
