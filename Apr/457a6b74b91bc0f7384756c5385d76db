Pangani Girls School Principal Florence Ngangari has attributed the institution’s success to government support. The school was among the top ten preferred schools by candidates which received more than 118,000 applications. This is more than double the available 336 positions that can accommodate new students. Ngangari said the government has supported several projects including a footbridge that connects two sides of the school. “We could not burden our parents with building the footbridge since the highway passes in the middle of the school but the government chipped in,” Ngangari said. She also added that the school has been keen on ensuring one hundred per cent transition to university. “Last year we had 93 per cent transition, every year we ensure all children are enrolled in university,” she added. Pangani Girls has constantly produced top candidates during the release of KCSE exams. The ministry of education allocated three CBC classrooms in preparation for junior secondary learners. Nanyuki High School received the highest number of applications for Form 1 admission. The Oliver Minishi- led school received 156,003 applications against a capacity of 480 students. Kabianga High 149,087 against 528 slots and Pangani Girls 118,073 against a population of 336.
