Former Nairobi Diaries cast Mishi Dorah and Pendo are still beefing. Their beef started while working on the show more than four years ago. Mishi accused Pendo of having an affair with her boyfriend, saying it is the reason she left Nairobi Diaries. In a recent Q and A session with her fans, Mishi was asked about her relationship with Pendo. She said, "Let's talk about living things, please. Who is that?" Quitting the show she said; "I can’t be on the same show with you Ciggie, you have a job and I don’t have one. Go back to your job and let me continue being on Nairobi Diaries because this is my main hustle. "I don’t go around sleeping with men I work hard for my money. Pendo betrayed me and if she’s gonna pick things with Ciggie, that’s fine. I’m not going to be on Nairobi Dairies anymore."
