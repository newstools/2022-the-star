Politicians should observe self-discipline, political decency and decorum as they campaign, Green Thinking Action Party leader Isaac Kalua has said. Kalua, a renowned environmentalist, said some utterances made at campaign platforms border on toxicity and are neither good for peace and tranquility nor conducive for the country’s development. He spoke during a fundraiser for the construction of St Martins ACK Church Cathedral in Kitui town on Sunday. Kalua said it is imperative for politicians to bear in mind that Kenya will exist beyond the August 9 polls. “Our country needs peace. We must develop as a country and there is no one else to do that than ourselves. It is a price we have to pay for democracy,” Kalua said. He also said Kenyans should embrace forgiveness as a way of serving God and humanity. "The guiding spirit should be the forgiveness of those who offend others instead of reiterating," Kalua said. The GTAP leader, however, said that tough measures such as banning of certain phrases and names by the NCIC will not help much, unless politicians behave and act decently during their campaigns. Kalua also said government agencies tasked with regulating hate speech and war mongering such as the National Cohesion and Integration Commission should aim for leniency and fairness. He, however, said politicians should be self-cautious and refrain from uttering words stated as harmful by the NCIC. The environmentalist said words such as “vijana moto, vijana fire”, which were not outlawed among the 23 phrases, are still potentially injurious. Kalua said politicians seeking elective posts in the August polls should focus on addressing real challenges affecting Kenyans such as the high cost of living, devastating impacts of climate change and infrastructure development.
