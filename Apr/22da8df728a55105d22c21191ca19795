The Kenya National Highways Authority has told Nairobi residents that they are working to ensure the drainage system on the Nairobi Expressway is fixed. In a statement on Monday, April 18, KeNHA said that the contractor is working to ensure all other features of the Nairobi Expressway are also fixed and that the road is safe manner for all motorists. "The water on the Expressway will be properly channelled to designated drainage lines," KeNHA said. Following Monday's heavy downpour, Mombasa Road and Uhuru Highway experienced traffic disruption because the pool of water on the Expressway was draining to the lower road, causing severe flooding. "We regret any inconveniences caused by this occurrence," KeNHA said. Additionally, KeNHA says that works on the Expressway are still in progress and the final installation of the drainage system is yet to be completed. "In the meantime, the contractor has deployed extra work teams and equipment to focus on all outstanding works, including the drainage system, targeting completion before the rains result in peak flows," KeNHA reported. KeNHA urges motorists to exercise caution when driving through the stormwater in the affected areas even as the works are ongoing to resolve the situation.
