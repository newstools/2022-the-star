General Service Unit coach Gideon Tarus wants left attackers to rise to the occasion to avoid over-reliance on  Cornelius Kiplagat. The tactician told Naftali Chumba, Bonfetry Wekesa, Nicholas Matui, and Nicholas Kimaru to advance their game to ease pressure on Kiplagat. The paramilitary side have over the years depended on the experienced Kiplagat but Tarus believes it is time for others to prove themselves. Kiplagat was rested for the weekend fixtures against Prisons Rift Valley and Kenya Forest Service and his absence was felt with the record national champions needing five sets to prevail over KFS. "We are privileged to have the best-left attacker in the league but that does not mean we have to hang on him all the time. There's a likelihood he might not be available next season and so other players need to step up and justify their positions," Tarus reckons. "We have to prepare for life without some big names. We wanted young players to get playing time and that's why we rested Kiplagat. They are not badly off but they have to learn and adapt quickly to the demands of the game." The African men's Club Championship is scheduled for May 5-18 in Tunisia and GSU, Kenya Prisons, and Kenya Ports Authority will represent the country. GSU will resume training on Wednesday ahead of the continental assignment. Tarus said they will use the Nyayo gymnasium to get their act together but believes they are ready to battle for the title that has proved elusive over the years. "It is time to eliminate the errors in our game. My preference for our workout is the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. This time around, I want the players to change their mindset and focus on the title," he added. Tarus said GSU will not stand in the way of any player who lands a professional deal overseas because that is a sign of growth. "We are open to our players playing abroad. We know what it means for the individual players and the national team," he noted.
