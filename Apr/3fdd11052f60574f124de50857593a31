A little known aspirant for the Bomet woman representative seat Linet Chepkorir, alias 'Toto', was poised to win the UDA party ticket after showing an early lead in the nominations race. In the provisional results, Chepkorir seemed to have overtaken her 10 other contestants gaining 60 per cent of the total votes counted as of 1 am across the five sub-counties. Bomet governor Hillary Barchok was also in the lead with 70,823 from 218 polling stations against his lone competitor the former CAS John Mosonik who had scored 33,892 votes by the time of going to press. In the senatorial race, Nairobi based lawyer Hillary Sigei was emerging the strongest against the incumbent Christopher Langat recording 62 per cent of all the votes counted across the county. Bomet woman representative Joyce Korir who leapt from her seat to run for the Bomet central parliamentary seat was trailing her main opponent Richard Kilel who had attained 6,342 votes against 2,451 by the time of going to press.
