Russia has denied involvement in the strikes on the railway station in Kramatorsk. The country's defence ministry said accusations that Russia had attacked the station were "a provocation" and "absolutely untrue". As evidence has emerged in recent days of other attacks against civilians elsewhere in Ukraine, Moscow has offered similar denials. The death toll has risen to 39 killed after two rockets hit Kramatorsk train station, according to the region's governor. Writing on Telegram, Pavlo Kyrylenko said the death toll had risen to 39, and that 87 people had also been wounded during the shelling. He added that many had suffered serious wounds. There are differing figures emerging from Ukraine about the total number wounded in the attack, with President Zelensky saying around 300 were injured. Kyrylenko said that despite the bombardment, evacuations from the region would continue.
