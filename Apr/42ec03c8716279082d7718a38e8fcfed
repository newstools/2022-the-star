United States International University (USIU) teams will return to the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) league this year. Joseph Amoko, the KBF fixtures secretary, revealed that the institution has confirmed their return and their inclusion in programme for the year. “USIU teams will be back in this year’s league,” disclosed Amoko. “We have already received a communication from their sports office to that effect. The women’s side will play in the league’s second tier while the men will battle it out in Division Two.” The teams’ pulled out of basketball activities in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We all know the reason why they pulled out of the league. Now that they are ready to return, we can only welcome them back to the fold,” Amoko said. USIU women became the first varsity side to win the Premier League title when they lifted back-to-back trophies in 2014 and 2015. The feat gave the institution an opportunity to represent the country in the Fiba Africa Championship Cup for women. Amoko also announced that the 2022 season will tip off May 7, less than two weeks after the conclusion of the 2021 season. “I am already drafting the fixtures for the new season and the calendar will be out soon. We don’t want to waste any more time. We are already late,” he said. He asked teams to be ready for a marathon year with weekday matches being mooted if the league is to end in time.
