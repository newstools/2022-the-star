Police are pursuing a suspect believed to have defiled a 7-year-old girl at a Kiambu church's toilet during a wedding on Saturday. The National Police Service in a statement said a report on the incident was filed at Gatundu Police Station. The mother of the girl is said to have allowed her daughter to use the church's washroom around 4 pm but she became worried after she failed to return within the expected time. The distraught parent proceeded to check on her only to be met by a gory scene of her helpless child lying in a pool of blood inside the washroom. The minor narrated that a stranger stormed the toilet door and forcefully defiled her while threatening her with dire consequences if she called for help. The innocent victim was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital from Gatundu Level V Hospital where she had been rushed for treatment. She is admitted in critical condition. "The National Police Service strongly condemns the cruel act of criminality meted on the minor and wishes her a speedy recovery,"  NPS said. NPS has assured the family that it will mobilise the necessary resources to ensure the culprit is promptly apprehended and charged. At the same time, members of the public have been reminded that they have a societal and moral duty to protect children from harm.
