Former Majority Leader Aden Duale now says they will impose several amendments on President Uhuru Kenyatta's last budget that was unveiled on Thursday. Duale, in a direct message to Treasury CS Ukur Yatani, said they will ensure legal processes are followed to the latter. The Garissa Township MP reiterated his earlier remarks that the President's last budget is unconstitutional since legal parliamentary processes were breached. "Without taking the due diligence of parliamentary processes and committees in the making of the budget, the minister of Finance went on to unveil the budget." Duale termed Yatani's budget reading session as inconsequential saying they will make necessary reforms on various allocations starting next week. He added that the Departmental and Budget Committees will reallocate several allocations made during the Financial year 2022/23 Budget. "From Tuesday the Speaker will refer the estimates to Departmental committees, Budget committee. We will reallocate what you have allocated and change what you have proposed," Duale said. "The Budget is not yet done until the Parliament approves. So, Ukur Yatani what you read is what you usually read at a village in Marsabit." The Garissa Township MP was speaking at a Karen Hotel where the Speaker of National Assembly Justin Muturi was joining the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. Duale said that it is the duty of Kenya Kwanza to fix Kenya's economy. "Even when we form the government, if we don't fix the economy in the first 18 months, Kenya will go the Greece way," he warned. He reiterated that as the Minister of Finance, Yatani should have followed the Parliamentary process in the Budget making and planning process. On Thursday, Duale said that Yatani usurped the role of the National Assembly in the making of the budget. He said the move was illegal and against the constitution.
