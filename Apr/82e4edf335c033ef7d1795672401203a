Saudi Arabia has announced that Kenya will participate in this year's Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca. The pilgrimage ordinarily attracts about two million Muslims from around the globe. The Kingdom has however pegged the number at one million pilgrims this year. Only people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and are under the age of 65 will be allowed to perform the Hajj this year. A total of 4,500 Kenyan Muslims will be part of the pilgrims. Kenya Hajji mission under the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) on Thursday urged those who will make the trip to adhere to the Saudi Arabia guidelines. "The council would like to urge those intending to travel to perform Hajj to prepare early enough to avoid last minute rush," SUPKEM said. The council added that the attendees will be required to complete immunization for Yellow Fever, Neisseria Meningitides, seasonal flu and Covid 19. "They are also required to provide a negative PCR test for a sample testing of 72 hours within their departure to Saudi Arabia." The council chairman Hassan Ole-Naado added that all faithfuls will be required to wear masks in both open and closed sessions during the Hajj. He added that the Pilgrims will be required to take a medical insurance cover for Covid-19 treatment in case of infection. SUPKEM lauded Saudi Arabia for their invitation saying it will give Kenyan Muslim faithfuls a chance to celebrate the Pillar of Islam.
