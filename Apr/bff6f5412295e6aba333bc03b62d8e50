A suspected thug narrowly escaped death after the victim he had attacked snatched his firearm and shot at him in Njiru, Nairobi County, on Wednesday. Sanga, a Tanzanian national, had travelled from the neighbouring country to visit his fiancé in Mihang’o, DCI director George Kinoti said. The two lovebirds decided to go out at around 2 am but unfortunately, on arrival, the club was closed. According to police, Sanga left his fiancé in the car and went to knock on the pub’s door, and it was at this point that he was attacked. "One young man leapt from the motorbike and pointed a gun at Sanga," Kinoti said. Sanga hurriedly emptied his pockets and gave out his mobile phones, ATM cards, car keys and Sh27,000. "But in the process, Sanga snatched the firearm from the thug," he said. He opened fire on the criminals who managed to escape from the scene. Detectives and police officers based at DCI Kayole visited the scene and recovered a jersey belonging to one of the suspects. They also recovered the firearm from the victim and discovered that it was a homemade firearm. Droplets of blood were also visible at the scene. Kinoti says an operation to apprehend the suspects is currently underway, with crime scene detectives employing forensic investigation techniques, to reveal the identity of the assailants.
