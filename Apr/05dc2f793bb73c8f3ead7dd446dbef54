Christians around the world celebrated the Easter vigil on Saturday night as candles were lit and prayers made. During the vigil, the faithfuls carry lighted lamps or candles in their hands. In most cases this symbolises that they are looking for the Lord when he returns, so that at his coming he may find them awake and have them sit at his table. Of this night’s Vigil, which is the greatest and most noble of all solemnities, there is to be only one celebration in each church. The entire celebration of the Easter Vigil must take place during the night, so that it begins after nightfall and ends before daybreak on the Sunday. The Mass of the Vigil, even if it is celebrated before midnight, is a paschal Mass of the Sunday of the Resurrection. During the vigil, Pope Francis condemned the cruelty of the war in Ukraine. The Mass was attended by Ivan Fedorov, the mayor of Melitopol, who was detained by Russian forces last month and later freed in a prisoner exchange. Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re replaced the pope as the main celebrant at the service, which involved a procession in near-total darkness up the central nave of Christendom's largest church. The pope sat at the front of Saint Peter's Basilica in a large white chair on the side, appeared alert and stood during the reading of the gospel.
