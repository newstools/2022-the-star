United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Kenya Representative Ademola Olajide is all set to end his leadership of the agency. Olajide has been UNFPA’s representative in Kenya for five years after his appointment in July 2017. He is set to head on to South Sudan to represent the UN agency there. Olajide will be remembered for his dedication to the fight against Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), young people’s access to Reproductive Health Services as well as women’s access to these services, especially in marginalised areas. He will also be remembered for his witty tweets that he used to highlight the course UNFPA championed. He used quotes and proverbs that resonated with Africans and Kenyans as a whole while dismantling perceptions, misconceptions and half-truths that made the fight for gender equality stall. In a farewell post on his Twitter page, Olajide gave thanks to the Kenyan team at UNFPA for being supportive of his leadership. "However long the night the dawn will break,” he said. “The dawn breaks, marking the end of my service as UNFPA Kenya representative. I celebrate the progress we have made, appreciate the friendship we have built and acknowledge the grounds we are yet to conquer. Asante sana,” he concluded
