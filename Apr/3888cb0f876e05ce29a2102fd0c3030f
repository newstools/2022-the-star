Tallying of results for the Kisumu ODM nominations is currently ongoing at the Tom Mboya Labour College. This is even as police continue to control the crowd that is charging a few meters from the tallying centre. In some instances, police were forced to lobby teargas at the defiant crowd who have stayed put wanting to gain access to the centre. Presiding officers and different officials continue to troop in with their gadgets and lists accompanied by different security officers. At the time of going to press only gadgets from Kisumu West had not arrived. The rest from the other sub-counties had arrived. Various aspirants and their agents wait for the final announcement of the results. Only a chief agent was allowed to accompany their aspirant to the polling centre. "We are just here waiting for the outcome of the results. You can't even tell whether you are leading on not so it's a wait and see affair," one aspirant told the media. Another aspirant added, "You can see what is going on here, everyone is worried, but we are hoping for the best". The exercise started smoothly in most polling stations across the county. The voting exercise started at about 7 am in various polling stations. However, challenges of few gadgets and missing names were witnessed in Nyakach and Muhoroni constituencies. The gadgets hanging was also an issue that saw the voting process temporarily halted in some stations before normalcy resumed.
