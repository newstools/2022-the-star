Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire has received a bomb threat to his home in Cheshire with local police conducting a sweep of the venue, the BBC and others reported on Thursday. Defender Maguire, who lives with his fiancee and two young children, had received the threat via email, reports said. Cheshire Police confirmed in a statement they were called to reports of a bomb threat in the Wilmslow area on Wednesday, a day after United lost 4-0 to Liverpool at Anfield. “No evacuations took place, but as a precautionary measure a police explosives dog attended the address this afternoon, Thursday 21 April, to conduct a search of the gardens and surrounding area,” the statement said. “No suspicious items were found during the search. An investigation into the bomb threat remains ongoing and no arrests have been made at this time,” an updated statement later added. Maguire has come under heavy criticism for his disappointing displays for club and country amid a dip in form this season. The 29-year-old was also booed by a section of England fans during a 3-0 friendly win over Ivory Coast at Wembley Stadium last month.

Manchester United did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
