Tottenham boss Antonio Conte has backed Harry Kane to become one of the best strikers in history. The England captain has reached new heights in the last two years, continuing to be prolific in front of goal while also becoming the team’s best playmaker when dropping into a number 10 role. He is on the brink of becoming his country’s all-time leading goalscorer, a record he is also close to breaking at Spurs, while he has targeted breaking Alan Shearer’s all-time tally in the Premier League. Conte already rates him as world-class but thinks he can go on and have a lasting legacy.
