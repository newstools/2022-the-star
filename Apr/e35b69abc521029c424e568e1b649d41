The late retired President Mwai Kibaki would never badmouth his competitors at any given time, Nyeri Archbishop Anthony Muheria told mourners during the burial service of the late head of state. While presiding over his burial ceremony at Othaya Approved school, Muheria urged mourners present and Kenyans at large to allow themselves to be carriers of God's mercy as Kibaki was. He added that Kibaki would want Kenyan leaders to stop fanning hate speech and instead preach peace. "I am sure he would want our leaders to let God be on their lips. We need a special sanitiser to disinfect our toxic mouths." The presiding Archbishop urged Kenyans and leaders to desist from hating one another. He said Kibaki loved the peace and would wish the country stays intact in harmony. He also said that Kibaki was a man who would never use falsehood for personal gains. Muheria urged Kenyans to always be truthful as an honour to the fallen statesman. "Let us be truthful and be real without rudeness towards each other." Muheria added that Kibaki was a selfless and 'self-send' man who served Kenyans with integrity. "He never took offence. Today he'd tell us to love our brothers and sisters," Muheria said. Muheria further urged Kenyans and leaders to be humble as Kibaki was. "Let us keep the faith. It also means humility and that is one thing we can emulate from our father Kibaki. Today is an example of his wish to be buried in simplicity," he said. Bishop Muheria lauded Kibaki's family for following in his footsteps of humbleness. The man of God recalled a time when Kibaki visited the Nyeri Cathedral in his old age and knelt down to confess and after that, he walked out silently without turning the church into a rowdy political arena. Muheria reiterated Jimmy Kibaki's words on Friday, telling Kenyans to shun shoddy and unfinished works.
