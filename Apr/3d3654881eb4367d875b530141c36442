The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) has directed that cases dealing with Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), Terrorism and, Terrorism and Financing be prioritized ahead of the August 9, general elections. The DPP Noordin Haji has added that although prosecution for graft crimes remains in focus, they will not be prioritized for the next three months. "It is noteworthy to note that the fight against corruption remains our number one priority and will remain so even during the election period," he clarified. Haji said that the strategy will enable the ODPP to devote their resources and time to the cases that directly impact elections. He however added that prosecuting leaders suspected of corruption will not bar them from campaigning. "It is important to note that the law only stops those convicted for more than six months from seeking elections. Not their prosecution," he added. He has further challenged voters to look into the aspirants whose cases are still under investigation, in court and those named by the Ethics and Anti Corruption Commission (EACC), and make informed decisions on the ballot. Haji added that the public has a constitutional right to vote for trustworthy leaders. "Let us finish corruption at the ballot," he challenged.
