Actress and producer, Nice Githinji, is currently in a romantic relationship with multiple partners. The veteran actress told Buzz Central she embraces being in an open relationship. "My partners may not know, but I am not lying that they are the only ones," she said. "I am not big on commitments and ownership. I have a very big heart that has the capability of loving several people at the same time." Nice said she is finding herself better. "I have been dating since I was 18 years and everyone I dated, we lived together and stayed not less than three years," she said. "It was like moving from one marriage to another. I was in a string of marriages, and now I am trying to find out who I am."
