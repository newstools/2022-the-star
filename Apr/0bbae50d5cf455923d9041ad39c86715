President Uhuru Kenyatta's nominee for the Ethics and Anti-corruption Commission (EACC) has backed the push to bar politicians facing corruption cases from contesting in the August 9 polls. Dr Cecilia Mutuku on Wednesday told a parliamentary committee that leaders facing corruption charges should not be allowed near a public office. She was speaking when he appeared before Justice and Legal and Affairs of the National Assembly for an approval hearing. The 54-year-old Human Resource professional said Kenyans should consider ethics and morals when electing people to serve in the public space. "This is a moral issue, I think I would go with the question of will you employ someone who is accused of corruption because he or she has not been charged?" Mutuku said. She added: "Even the most corrupt when they want to hire they go for the best." She was responding to a question by Keiyo South MP Daniel Rono. Mutuku, worth Sh6 million, is currently the head of the Human Resource department at Kenya Beaurue of Standards (Kebs).
