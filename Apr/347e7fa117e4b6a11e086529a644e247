Kenya Simbas' head coach Paul Odera is eyeing an improvement after losing their opening match of the Currie Cup to South Africa Provincial side, Valke. Odera's charges lost 51-29 and face Africa rivals Zimbabwe next weekend.  The former Strathmore Leos and Kenya Under-20 coach is optimistic of a  good result. “Our first game did not go according to plan due to some challenges here but going forward, the boys will be in good shape and we will have had solid two-week training sessions to get into shape for the match against Zimbabwe,” said Odera. The Simbas trailed 29-0 at the interval before putting up a fight in the second half, resulting in a try each for Brian Tanga and Samuel Asati with Jone Kubu converting both tries. The team had only four training sessions before departure to South Africa and that was a huge factor in the defeat according to Odera. The Simbas had a training match against Western Province Under-20 on Wednesday and Odera said he was delighted with the performance of his side during the encounter. “ It was a tough game against the academy side and we were tested accordingly in all facets of our play. That will no doubt aid in our push for better results in the Currie Cup going forward," he noted. Odera said competition for places in the squad is intense and healthy as they look at various combinations. Skipper Dan Sikuta said they are targeting a win against Zimbabwe.  “A win against them will be key. Remember they are competing in the qualifiers for the World Cup and it will be a psychological boost for us,” added Sikuta. The Simbas are using the Currie Cup as a build-up for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers slated for France in July where Kenya will be targeting a maiden appearance at the global rugby extravaganza.
