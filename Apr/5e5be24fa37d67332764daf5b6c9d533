Nigerian musicians are successful because they support each other, Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz has said. Speaking to BBC, the singer said Nigerian music is celebrated globally because fans and musicians support artists. Diamond said he has done his research and is now working towards going international. "We need to do our research, from the artists to the record label," he said. "Nigerians support each other apart from the fact that they are many in numbers. We need to know what we need to do to penetrate into their industry and international world," he said. Although some of his songs resonate well with his local audience, they are not popular with the international audience. Diamond said his hit song Mtasubiri featuring Zuchu did well in the East African market while his Afrobeat song Wonder gained international recognition. "Do your research. You need to know what people want and at what time. I do some songs not because I love them but so that I'm able to get into the international audience," he said. Diamond said he was criticised after he started working with international artists. "When I was releasing the song Marry You ft Neyo and others, people at home thought I had lost direction," he said. "I had my own target and those are the songs that have helped me do shows all over Africa."
