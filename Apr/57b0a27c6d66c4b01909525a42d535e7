Muhoroni MP Onyango Koyoo has called on the ODM national elections board to give voters free, fair and credible nominations results. He said the board should respect the will and wish of voters by declaring the actual winners at the end of the voting exercise. Koyoo, who voted at Obago primary school, said the voting exercise in polling stations that he visited was peaceful and people are enthusiastic and in high spirit. "We are very hopeful that the elections board will stand by its mandate to deliver credible elections as was promised," he said. Koyoo, who is seeking to retain his seat for the third time, appealed for calm, unity and peace during the nominations exercise in the entire county. He is battling out for the ODM ticket with Joseph Okal, former Kisumu majority leader Samuel Ong'ow, Omulo Okowa and Hezron McObewa. In most of the polling stations Koyoo visited, he pointed out that turnout was good and voting peaceful. The voting started at around 7 am. Koyoo visited Obumba, Kigoche, Nyakoko, Muhoroni, Kibos and Ombeyi polling stations. "So far am very satisfied with the process and hope it will remain peaceful, "he said. The MP said elections come and go saying aspirants should embrace political tolerance and peace during the exercise. "At the end of the day, we are brothers and sisters, and should remain united and steadfast after nominations and general elections to build our constituency," Koyoo said. He also wished all the aspirants well in the exercise. Koyoo however decried a few voting gadgets in some polling stations with voter turnout such as Obago where there was one kit when voting started. "We are happy the board has added one voting machine to help the situation due to the huge voter turnout," he said. Koyoo said he has made his choices and other aspirants should emulate that to vote in leaders they want and preach peace during the exercise.
