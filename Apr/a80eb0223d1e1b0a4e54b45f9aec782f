Tennis star Naomi Osaka says she is staying away from social media ahead of this year's French Open championship. The 24-year-old is recovering from being heckled by a fan in her second round loss at Indian Wells last month. The four-time grand slum champion was taken aback  in the first game at the tournament when a fan yelled at her 'you suck'. The Japanese star was seen wiping tears shortly afterwards. Osaka has been vocal about protecting her mental health.
