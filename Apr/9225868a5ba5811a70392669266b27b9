The government has launched a security and multi-agency committee at the Tana bridge in Garissa to tighten security in the area during Ramadan and Easter holidays. The committee, which consists of officials from the Immigration department, Kenya Revenue Authority, police and local administrators, assured the residents that there will be adequate security during the festive season. Speaking at the Tana bridge road block on Saturday, Garissa county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said the team will make sure no illegal immigrants, counterfeit goods or drugs pass through to Nairobi or other parts of the country. Cherutich said the police had on Wednesday arrested four illegal immigrants at the roadblock who will be charged at Garissa court on Tuesday. He said the government will take stern action against any individual including government officials, who will be found to be aiding immigrants movement into the country. "We have said time and again that as government we are strict on the kind of individual who cross into the country. Only those with genuine papers are allowed to come in," he said. “KRA and Kenya Bureau of Standards are here to make sure that no contraband goods or unaccustomed items are allowed to pass through from across borders,” Cherutich said. “We are also working together with all other teams to ensure there is security especially during this Ramadan and Easter holidays.” The county commissioner further said the refugees in Dadaab camps who want to travel to Nairobi for treatment or for other reasons must obtain permission from the authorities at the camps and from the immigration department.   -Edited by SKanyara
