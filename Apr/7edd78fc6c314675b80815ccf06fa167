Also known as Okro or Okra, this is an edible green seed pod that is quite popular in the west and Southern parts of Africa. Okra is highly nutritious and has a sweet, grassy flavour that has a slippery mouthfeel especially when cooked. The plant can be eaten raw or cooked and It's also rich in magnesium, folate, fiber, antioxidants, and vitamin C, K1, and A. Okra may benefit pregnant women, heart health, and blood sugar control.
