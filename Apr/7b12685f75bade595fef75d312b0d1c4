Zetech Sparks are banking on their next three matches to change the matrix in the ongoing Kenya Women's Premier League. Zetech are set to face Gaspo, Thika Queens, and Bunyore Starlets in their next three matches.  Sparks confirmed their top-flight status after thrashing minnows Kisumu All Starlets 7-1 on Sunday. With their safety assured, coach Bernard Kitolo wants his charges to also rise to the occasion against the bigwigs in the KWPL. "We face a season-defining moment against the aforementioned teams but we are not scared to face them," Kitolo affirmed. "Bunyore (Mumboha), Gaspo (Ruaraka), and Thika away are all tricky matches for us. The good thing is that my players have improved in the last few matches and I don't expect them to disappoint though I can't put pressure on them." The gaffer, especially, noted remarkable improvement in the goalkeeping and striking departments.  Captain Puren Alukwe scored five goals and set up an assist against Kisumu. Alukwe also scored the fastest goal in WPL, finding the back of the net after just six seconds to take her season tally to 14 goals. "Puren is on fire and looks unstoppable at the moment. She has peaked at the right time when we need the goals most. I know every team is now looking at us and that means we are doing well," he said. According to Kitolo, the return of experienced goalkeeper Stellah Ahono from a long-term injury is a welcome boost for Sparks while the signing of Valentine Khwaka from Ulinzi Starlets only serves to enhance competition. "Khwaka has quickly slotted seamlessly into the team since she arrived. She has only conceded twice in four matches she has played and I am impressed with her focus and vision."
