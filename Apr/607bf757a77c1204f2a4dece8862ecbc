Fuel prices have increased by Sh9.90 in this month's review by the Energy Regulatory Authority, EPRA. This now puts the price of a litre of petrol at Sh144.62 in Nairobi up from Sh134.72. A litre of diesel in Nairobi will now retail at Sh125.50 up from Sh115.60. Kerosene will retail at Sh113.44 in Nairobi up from Sh103.54. The new prices will take effect at midnight on Thursday, April 14 until midnight May 14, 2022. EPRA Chief Executive Officer Daniel Kiptoo said the new prices are inclusive of 8 per cent VAT in accordance the Finance Act, 2018, Tax Law amendment Act 2020 and adjustment of inflation rates. While releasing the new prices on Thursday, Kiptoo said the hike is as a result of a 20.47 per cent increase in the average landing cost for super petrol by,  24.7 per cent for diesel and 11.84 per cent for kerosene. This translates to a 20.47 per cent change in the cost of super petrol, 24.7 per cent change in the cost of diesel and 11.84 per cent in the cost of kerosene. "The government will utilize the petroleum development levy to cushion customers from the unusually otherwise high prices," Kiptoo said. He said oil marketers will be compensated Sh29.08 per litre of petrol, Sh40.24 per litre of diesel and Sh26.45 for kerosene.
