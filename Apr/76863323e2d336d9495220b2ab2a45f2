@robertomollo3 A security guard was killed by unknown assailants at Lake Primary School in Homa Bay Town constituency on Wednesday night. Samuel Okoth Odoyo , 33, sustained serious injuries on the head. His head seemed to have been hit with heavy stones, which smashed it. He died on the spot. His attackers fled the scene without being noticed. Odoyo’s murder remained unknown throughout the night. His body was later discovered by the headteacher Zablon Owala on Thursday morning. The body was in one of the classrooms. Owala became suspicious when he went to school and found that his office door had been broken into. He called the security guard but there was no response. The headteacher started walking into the classrooms to find out if there was anybody in the school buildings. He found Odoyo’s body lying in a pool of blood in a Grade 6 classroom. A number of heavy rocks with blood stains were found beside the body and it is suspected they were used to kill him. “The gangsters were not seen in the school but they deformed the security guard’s head with stones,” Owala said. Homa Bay subcounty police commander Sammy Koskey said they have launched investigations into the incident. Koskey said residents should collaborate with the police and divulge information over the matter. The body was taken to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary for postmortem. The gangsters made away with two projectors, two laptops and two tablets for Grade 1 digital literacy programmes. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
