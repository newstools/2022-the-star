Azimio la Umoja One Kenya party presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga on Friday evening pledged to fight corruption and free petty offenders should he clinch the presidency. Raila who held a virtual rally said he has not changed. "I have been defending the weak and I will never change," he said. He castigated the judicial system for prioritising the arrest of petty offenders instead of going after high-profile persons facing corruption charges. The ODM party leader was referring to the case of one Alvin Linus Chivondo. Chivondo was sentenced to a year in prison after he pleaded guilty to stealing cooking oil and rice at a local supermarket on Monday. “This is a very worrying case, it shows just how flawed our judicial system can be at times. He is just a petty offender but he was sentenced quite quickly yet we have persons facing graft cases," he said. "In most cases, they are not even arrested and when they are apprehended they get out of remand quickly. When they are freed on bail, nobody follows up on their cases." Raila says Kenya has a lot of petty offenders in prison. "...but in the event I clinch the presidency, I will free them and I will prioritise the arrest and sentencing of high profile gangsters,” he said. Last week, the ODM leader called for the unconditional release of  Chivondo, a Kenya who has been sentenced to one year in jail for shoplifting. Chivondo was, in the alternative, fined Sh100,000 by the court for shoplifting goods worth Sh3,165 from a Naivas supermarket. Raila also wished Kenyans a festive Easter holiday, urging them to be cautious on the roads and enjoy the festivities in moderation. “I wish you a great Easter Holiday to all Kenyans, wherever you may be. Be careful on the roads so that we do not lose more lives on the road. Enjoy the Easter festivities but do not overdo it," he said.
