Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said there is an improvement in the Special Needs Education (SNE) sector. Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results on Saturday, Magoha said the Government has made remarkable progress in improving access, relevance and transition in education for SNE learners. Magoha says that this has increased the number of SNE schools and increased enrolment for SNE learners. "Each public primary SNE learner also gets capitation of Sh3,720 while each secondary school SNE learner gets capitation of Sh53,807," Magoha said. Magoha further said the SNE sector will also be supported by a new state of the art National Psycho-Assessment and Referral Centre at the Kenya Institute of Special Education(KISE). This will serve the purpose to strengthen educational assessment and facilitate the placement of children with special needs in appropriate educational programmes. The CS said they have also registered significant strides in the adaptation of textbooks in the areas of hearing, physical and visual impairment and the supply of braille books for learners who are totally blind. Last year, Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said all teachers in the new diploma training programme will be trained in handling special needs learners. "The diploma teachers' training replaces the traditional certificate programme otherwise referred to as P1 training," he said. Prospective trainees must have a mean grade of C (plain) in KCSE with a C (plain) in two subjects they wish to teach upon graduating. The ministry said the new entry grade was occasioned by the demands of the Competency-Based Curriculum.
