Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has won the UDA Senate seat nomination with 75,847, while his main rival lawyer Kipchumba Karoli got 55,854. Politician Jonathan Bii won the UDA primaries for the governor seat. He polled 71,152 votes against his closest rival former envoy Julius Bitok who got 59,001. In third place was Vesca Kangogo who got 7,463 while former envoy Sarah Serem got 19,112. Incumbent Gladys Shollei won the woman representative seat after she got 94,343 against her main rival Rael Chebichi who got 54,961. Earlier, UDA was forced to send nominated senator Millicent Omanga to Eldoret following a statement in the announcement of nomination results in Moiben Constituency. There was a day-long stalemate between two groups allied to former MP Joseph Lagat and politician Phyllis Bartoo. Both had claimed victory in the UDA MP ticket for Moiben but there was confusion over tallying in some polling stations. The area returning officer Aaron Chemonis was unable to announce results for the better part of the day forcing the party to send in Senator Omanga. The stalemate caused a delay in the declaration of results for the governor and senate races in the county.
