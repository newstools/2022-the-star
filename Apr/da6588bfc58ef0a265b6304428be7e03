Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola heaped praise on his side following their 4-3 win against Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first-leg. Guardiola said the results could have been better but Madrid being the side it is, it doesn't matter if the result is 1-0 or two or three, you have to perform well. "It's a good test to show our personality as a team, and we are going to travel there to win the game," he said. Guardiola said he is proud of the result against the experienced top flight Spanish side which has been participating in the Champions league for the past decade. He said they did everything to win with the ball and without the ball and hopes they will maintain the momentum in the return leg in Madrid.
