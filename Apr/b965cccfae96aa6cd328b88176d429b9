The United Democratic Alliance (UDA) has issued summons to three of its members over the chaos that happened outside the Izaak Walton Inn in Embu town. Margaret Lorna Kariuki (Nominated Member of County Assembly), John Muchiri Nyaga (Manyatta MP) and Norman Nyaga (UDA politician) were on Wednesday directed to appear before the party's disciplinary committee for the allegations of willful arson and destruction of poll materials. A statement released says that there is evidence of video footage, information and material linking the three to the incident. "The disciplinary committee hereby summons you to appear before it on Saturday, April 16 at 9:00 am for the hearing of the matter at the Hustlers Centre on Makindi Road off Riara Road in Nairobi," the statement reads. The three were warned that if the allegations are proven, they will be disqualified from the nominations and will face either suspension or expulsion from the party. Kariuki, Muchiri and Nyaga can either appear in person or bring along a member of UDA or advocate of the High Court of Kenya to represent them. The UDA primary nominations began on Thursday, April 14. In the Embu chaos, a lorry ferrying nomination materials were on Wednesday ransacked and the ballot boxes and papers were burnt. Embu aspirants had earlier addressed the media dismissing allegations over reports of rigging plans.
