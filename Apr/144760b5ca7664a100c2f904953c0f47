Kibera singer Stivo Simple Boy has launched a clothing line called 'Freshi Barida'. Through his Instagram, the Mihadarati artiste announced to his fans that his merchandise is out and ready for the market. He shared photos wearing the merchandise as he requested his fans to support him by buying them. According to the post, the Kibera-based artiste will be selling high-quality hoods at Sh2,500, normal quality hoods at Sh2,000 and T-shirts at Sh1,000. There will be no delivery fee and the payment will be done once you receive your item. This is the second time the 'Mihadarati' crooner is launching his clothing line, which is a great achievement for him. In September 2021, Stivo launched his first clothing line, carrying his name and a signature drop line, 'Ndio maanake'.
