The war in Ukraine has made it difficult for patients to access vital healthcare services, including HIV treatment. UNAIDS and partners have said they are working to distribute life-saving HIV medicines and services to those affected by conflict. “It is becoming increasingly difficult for people to access the health care they need, including services for HIV,” said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “UNAIDS estimates that 260 000 people were living with HIV in Ukraine before the war broke out, 152 000 of whom were taking daily medication for HIV. There is no cure for HIV. Without access to antiretroviral medicines, people living with HIV will die.” The World Health Organization estimates that there have been 82 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances and doctors in Ukraine since the war began, killing 72 and injuring at least 43 people. Nearly 50% of Ukraine’s pharmacies are presumed to be closed and many health workers are either displaced or unable to work. UNAIDS with its cosponsors WHO and UNICEF together with USAID, PEPFAR, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria is working to ensure a 12-month supply of medicines for people living with HIV in Ukraine. Delivery of 209 000, 90-day supplies of antiretroviral medicines has already arrived in Lviv, Ukraine and it is ready to be distributed to the people. UNAIDS has however said distribution might be a challenge, particularly in conflict areas. It has urged respect for and protection of humanitarian corridors to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid and safe passage for civilians to safety. The World Health Organization has said it is working with Ukraine’s Public Health Centre on collecting data, while maintaining confidentiality, to understand the whereabouts and needs of people living with HIV affected by the war. There is currently no precise data on the movements of people living with HIV who have already left the country.
