Offset and Cardi B have finally settled on the perfect name for their 7-month-old son. The couple welcomed their second child seven months ago but only announced his name last week. It was Migos rapper Offset, 30, whose real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus, that suggested the unusual name. According to TMZ, Cardi loved Wave as soon as Offset suggested it but it was a struggle for them to decide on a middle name. They originally considered Marley, in homage to Cardi's middle name, Marlenis, but Cardi did not like how Wave Marley Cephus flowed. So, Offset, who is known as Set to his friends, suggested his nickname which Cardi loved.
