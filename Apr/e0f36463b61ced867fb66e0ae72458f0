Sauti Sol's Chimano is set for the release of his 1st solo EP, 'Heavy is the Crown'. Chimano gave his fans a sneak peek of the EP's cover through his Instagram page. In the image shared, Chimano appears to be receiving a big crown from himself. He announced the EP will be released on April 15. Speaking about it, Chimano told Word Is earlier he needed to have the courage to be that for others, to inspire them to see that they can also be themselves. "If you go through life... respecting the right of others to live unrestricted as long as it's not an infringement on your human rights, then you have a crown on your head," he said. Chimano and other Sauti Sol members are on a Europe tour.
