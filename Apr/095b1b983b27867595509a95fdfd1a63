WhatsApp has announced that users will be able to enjoy a new tab called communities in the coming weeks. “We have been focused on how we can help people have the next best thing to an in-person conversation when they want to talk to an individual or a group of friends or family,” WhatsApp said in a statement. Communities will enable people to bring together other separate groups under one umbrella with a structure that works for them. The feature will allow admins to send messages to thousands and have control over which groups can be included. The group admins will also be able to remove errant and problematic messages from everyone’s chats. They also plan to introduce a one-tap voice calling that can include up to 32 people in the call. “Communities are inherently private, which is why we will continue to protect messages with end-to-end encryption. This security technology has truly never been more necessary to protect people’s privacy and safety,” they said. WhatsApp said conversations will be private and secure. Organisations like schools, local clubs, and non-profit organisations now rely on WhatsApp to communicate securely and get things done. The new feature will make it easier by helping people manage busy conversations among those kinds of groups. File size sharing will also support files up to 2 Gigabytes, so that people can easily collaborate on project. The new tab will first be rolled to a small number of selected groups before it is rolled out to everyone else in the coming weeks.
