Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has said he was taken to court 60 times by rivals to prevent him from initiating development projects. He said the projects were meant to change the face of Bungoma and create jobs for the youth. The governor said among the projects that were opposed included a dual carriageway, the 300-bed Bungoma County Referral Hospital, Wangamati Scholarship programme and the employment of village administrators. He said if reelected, he will build factories in every subcounty to create more jobs for the youth. Wangamati spoke in Webuye West constituency on Monday during a public engagement with residents. He urged politicians to conduct peaceful campaigns. “I appeal to politicians and their supporters to preach peace whenever they go,” Wangamati said. He condemned the recent stoning of ODM leader Raila Odinga’s chopper in Uasin Gishu county. “I'm happy because some of those who attacked Baba’s chopper were arrested,” the county chief said. The DAP-K governor aspirant asked Western Kenya to rally behind Raila’s bid. He also urged Bungoma residents to vote for Azimio la Umoja MP aspirants. Edited by A.N
