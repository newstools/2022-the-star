The Director of Public Prosecution Noordin Haji has said administrative measures should be explored to bar corrupt politicians from vying in the coming polls. Haji says that it would be a fundamental mistake to allow impeached governors to vie for office. The DPP said he will explore the options through the National Council on the Administration of Justice where he is the vice-chair. He also dismissed the perception that his office stopped corruption prosecutions against sitting politicians, saying that he only prioritize election-related cases. The DPP, in an exclusive interview with the Star in early April, said his office halted approval of corruption files linked to any politician during the electioneering period. "We don’t want to be accused of making decisions based on political leanings,” Haji said. The interpretation of this is that the DCI and the EACC may proceed with their anti-corruption investigations but the ODPP will not grant prosecution, at least until after the polls. In March, the EACC said it had concluded investigations into corruption allegations involving three governors. The agency said the files were ready for the immediate prosecution of governors Anne Waiguru of Kirinyaga, Tana River's Dhadho Ghodana, and Lamu’s Fahim Twaha.
