Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi on Sunday said exiled Lawyer Miguna Miguna can regain his citizenship and travel back to the country if he fills the prescribed documents. During an interview with NTV, Matiangi said the embattled lawyer lost his citizenship by virtue of the old constitution that did not allow for dual citizenship. “The process is as simple as filling a one-page document. In Canada, the process is done online and the passport is processed. Over 300,000 people have filled the document, what is so hard about that?” he said. Matiangi also addressed accusations that his ministry disregarded numerous court orders instructing him to allow Miguna into the country. He noted that he is bound by the law when carrying out his duties. Miguna, who is both a Kenyan and Canadian, was deported in February 2018 after taking part in the swearing-in of ODM leader Raila Odinga as the 'People's President' at Uhuru Park on January 30, 2018. Several attempts by the Lawyer to gain access to the country have been futile as the government insists that he must apply for Kenyan citizenship afresh, something Miguna has refused. The Lawyer has insisted that he cannot apply to be a Kenyan citizen yet he never stopped being one. Numerous court orders have been issued in his favour but the State has maintained that Miguna lost his citizenship and must therefore apply afresh. Miguna was born and bred in Kenya before he went to Canada for studies. He has stayed there for decades working as a lawyer. His immediate family also resides in Canada The Lawyer promised to fight for his rights saying the Kenyan government can block him from coming to Kenya but he will never cave in to their "Illegal demands"
