Fine dining refers to a restaurant experience that is of a higher quality and greater formality compared to the experience at a casual dining restaurant. The atmosphere of a fine dining establishment is usually more elegant, and the food is served in a more formal way. The guests at a fine dining restaurant are also expected to uphold a certain level of civility. It is an experience that involves manners and social graces that in the end boils down to respect. The way you position your utensils sends specific signals to the wait staff. Avoid holding your knife like a dagger and placing the cutlery on the table once you have picked them up You should wait until everyone is seated at the table and he or she has been served before you indulge in your food. It is important to do a bit of research on the hotel beforehand as some hotels have very strict dress codes. The dress code in fine dining is usually business casual, casually elegant, or formal attire. Tracksuit much ripped jeans, or shorts and slippers may not work for a fine–dining setting. When it comes to fine dining, the menu should always be touching the table. You can lift a side up, but ensure it is still touching the table, not like a newspaper. To avoid having a glass full of prints, always hold it from the stem, and after you sip, do it every time on the same spot to avoid that lip ring. Then put it back in the same place where you picked it. In fact, saying you are going to the washroom is no better, just excuse yourself, but do not say why.
