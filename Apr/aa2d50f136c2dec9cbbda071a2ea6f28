Kenya Sevens head coach Innocent Simiyu has lauded his charges despite relinquishing the Africa Cup Sevens title title to Uganda. Shujaa lost to Uganda 22-12 in the semis but bounced back to beat Zambia in the bronze medal match 19-12 to qualify for the Rugby World Cup tournament in South Africa in September alongside Uganda and Zimbabwe. The former skipper said the target was to qualify despite a grueling campaign in the World Sevens Series, which saw them play in Singapore and Vancouver. "I'm happy with the boys' efforts despite the long and challenging month with a tight travel schedule. However, we have qualified for the World Cup and that was one of our targets for this season," said Simiyu. Simiyu said the side must adjust to the conditions in front of them after playing in wet and treacherous situations in Kampala, where they also lost 12-7 to Madagascar. "I feel we did not adjust well to the wet weather and chaos during the second day. We ended up making a few errors at critical times against both Uganda and Madagascar and that cost us,” he observed. Shujaa's next assignment will be the Toulouse and London legs of the World Sevens Series next month and Simiyu expects to have Alvin 'Buffa' Otieno and Jeff Oluoch back in the fold as they prepare for the Commonwealth Games in July. "Alvin played in Uganda and did quite well and should be available for ther next two evenst while Jeff should have recovered from the ankle injury sustained in Malaga and Seville and that will boost our options,” added Simiyu. Simiyu expects the battle for slots in the team to intensify heading into the final two legs of the series. "We have seen the emergence of good quality young players and we hope they can carry the form into the final part of the season," said Simiyu. Kenya have been drawn in a tough Pool 'B' for the Toulouse event where they face Fiji, Wales and hosts France.
