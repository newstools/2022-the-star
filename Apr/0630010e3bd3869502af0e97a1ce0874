Heavyweight clashes, local derbies, politics and revenge - take a look at some of the most interesting matches at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Senegal and Holland will kick off first game of the tournament on November 21 followed by hosts Qatar who will take on Ecuador later that day. Senegal, the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions, will be hoping to become the first African side to reach a World Cup semi-final. The closest an Africa team came close to advancing to the semis was during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa when Ghana reached the quarter finals. The opening game is expected to be a thriller as Holland will be hoping to make up for the lost time after missing out on the previous tournament. Another game to watch out for is the England vs USA clash on November 25 as the Three Lions have never beaten USA in a World Cup match and they will be hoping to change that in Qatar.
