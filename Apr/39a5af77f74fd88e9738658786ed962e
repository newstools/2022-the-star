Gaspo Women forward Mercy Airo has not ditched the club, team manager Edward Githua has confirmed. Githua made the remarks after reports emerged on Friday that the Harambee Starlets' veteran had penned a deal with Zetech Sparks. "There's no way Airo can leave during the mid-season transfer window. In fact it's Ulinzi Starlets who have been angling for her services but we cannot release her because no one else in the team can fit in her role at the moment." Githua, however, said they are ready to set Airo free at the end of the season when they will also have an opportunity to beef up their squad. Gaspo have a lot of injuries in the attacking department, making it hard for the last season's Kenya Women's Premier League runners up to losen their stance. "Bertha Omita has been struggling with injuries while we also have a couple of players sidelined with different injuries,” Githua said. "We had earmarked some players to join us but their clubs refused to release them. Who are we to release ours?" Gaspo are third on the WPL standings with 25 points from 12 matches.
