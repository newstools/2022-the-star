Parents in Homa Bay want the Ministry of Education to cushion them against extra fees charged by some school heads. Homa Bay Parents' Association chairman Julius Omuga said some secondary school principals are imposing extra charges on parents as learning institutions reopen for the first term. The parents also accused some secondary schools of stocking learning materials like uniforms, books and bedding and selling them to students at hiked prices. Omuga said the most affected parents are those with children who have been admitted to Form 1. “We know schools where parents are told to pay Sh25,000 for a student’s uniform. They impose too much levies which prevent students from poor families from getting an education,” he said. Speaking to journalists in Homa Bay town on Wednesday, Omuga urged the government to make education affordable for all Kenyans by first banning such businesses in schools. He said many parents are poor and cannot afford the overpriced items. “Why is the government saying it offers affordable education when school heads are still imposing extra charges which make education of their children expensive?” Omuga questioned. “Let the ministry officials come out and protect parents against the unnecessary school levies.” Edited by A.N
