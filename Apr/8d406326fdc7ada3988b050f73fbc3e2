The Aquaman actress took to social media on Saturday to post a message in which she warned fans she would "go offline for the next several weeks" as a result of the upcoming legal proceedings related to a defamation lawsuit filed by Depp in early 2019. The 58-year-old has alleged an op-ed Heard wrote for The Washington Post in late 2018 in which she wrote about her experiences of leaving an abusive relationship, constituted a hoax against him and impacted his Disney projects.
