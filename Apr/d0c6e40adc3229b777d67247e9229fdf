Sauti Sol member Willis Austin Chimano says working on his EP 'Heavy Is The Crown' challenged him. He said the seven-track EP, reminiscent of sounds, was inspired by late 80s and early 90s music. "I felt uplifted and I understood who I am more with this project, and it’s one of the things that gives me undefiant confidence," he said. "The experience has been eye-opening to who I am. I made a new best friend within me that was waiting to come out to explore his creativity, image and brand." Chimano described the overarching theme and inspiration in each of the EP's tracks as the concept of truthfulness in one’s self-identity. "I needed to have the courage to be myself fully because of my newfound conviction. I needed to be that for others, and to inspire them to see that they can also be themselves," he said. "The crown, in this case, is on you and me. If you go through life in kindness, standing up for your dreams and aspirations, respecting your fellow human beings and respecting the right of others to live unrestricted as long as it's not an infringement on your human rights - then you have a crown on your head." The EP dropped alongside a new song, 'Hallelujah', written by Bien-Aimé. "It's a wonderful song that generally speaks to everybody in humanity," he said. "It also speaks to me. It’s a message to myself where I am putting myself first and walking this journey of life with my true self and like-minded individuals and anybody who wants to join us on this amazing journey."
