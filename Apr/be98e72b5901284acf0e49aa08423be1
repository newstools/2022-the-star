Louis Pisano has apologized for perpetuating a "reckless" rumours about Rihanna and A$AP Rocky. Late last week, the fashion influencer posted unsubstantiated gossip alleging the pregnant Umbrella hitmaker and the rapper had called it quits amid a cheating scandal involving designer Amina Muaddi. But Louis issued a statement in which he conveyed his regret over making the "dumb decision" to post the rumors online last Friday. "Last night I made a dumb decision to tweet some information I had received. I'm not going to talk about sources... because at the end of the day I made the decision."
