The body of former President Mwai Kibaki on Monday arrived at Parliament buildings a few minutes before 7:30 am. This followed a Solemn Procession that began from Lee Funeral Home and took to  Valley Road and Kenyatta Avenue through to Parliament Road. A Military Guard of Honour was mounted along Parliament Road for the entry procession into Parliament. The former Head of State will lie-in-state for the next three days. Kibaki died at the age of 90.
