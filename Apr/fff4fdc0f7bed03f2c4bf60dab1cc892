Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha is set to release the 2021 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam results today. Magoha is expected to release the exam results anytime from 11:30 am. The announcement will be made at Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) offices in the presence of education officials. Some 831,015 candidates sat the exam in 10,413 centres compared to 752,981 in 10,437 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 78,034 or 9.39 per cent. The announcement of the results will pave the way for admission to universities, colleges and technical institutions. University Education PS Simon Nabukwesi had previously said the candidates will join universities in June. He said those who will be enrolled in colleges and vocational institutes will report in September. The learners had until April 1 to select courses via the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement portal. This will give parents only one month to prepare for the learners' enrolment.
