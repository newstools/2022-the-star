Safina Party presidential aspirant Jimmy Wanjigi has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to retire peacefully after finishing his second and last term in office and stop interfering with the August 9 general elections. Wanjigi said the coalition agreement signed by Azimio coalition is proof that Uhuru still wants to influence government decisions after he leaves office. Speaking during a meeting with GEMA community members in Malindi, Kilifi county during the beginning of his two-day Coastal tour, Wanjigi  said Uhuru has not appreciated the chance he was given by Kenyans to be in power for the 10 years. “Your appreciation is like that of a donkey which throws kicks, go home we do not want to see you again, just move away from us, go away and go away completely,” he said. Wanjigi who was flanked by MCA, MP and governor aspirants in his party said Kenyans should know that its not Raila Odinga who is in the race but Uhuru. “Constitutionally, he must retire on August 9 this year but it seems just like China, there's a plan to make Kenya a communist party nation.” Wanjigi said he has embarked on his journey to be Kenya's next president and is happy to have many candidates in Kilifi in the Safina party. The politician cum businessman said they had only five days to hold the National Delegates Conference but still they managed to get all the candidates into the party. He said his journey to State House under Safina party was unstoppable, affirming that the coalition he was forming would be open with Kenyans and not tribal or based on creating positions. Wanjigi declared himself the bona fide People’s president saying the position fell vacant after shook hands with President Kenyatta. “When you see me here, I am the one who took over the position of Raila Amolo Odinga as the People’s president. He went to Harambee House to shake hands with others and left the position vacant,” Wanjigi said.
