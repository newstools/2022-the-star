Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has won the United Democratic Alliance party nominations held on Tuesday. Keter trounced his closest rival  Bernard Kitur in an election that saw a group of leaders allied to Deputy President William Ruto gang up against him. Nandi Hills is one of the regions where the UDA party enjoys massive support. A win in the nominations is billed as a step closer to the victory in a general election. In the vote cast, Keter garnered 10,263 votes. His closest challenger Kitur got 7,468 votes. Other in the race Robert Chepkwony got 2,539 votes, George Tarus had 425 votes, Abraham Limo 540 and Irine Chemutai 388. A total of 21,767 Nandi Hills residents took part in the primaries. The Constituency has 52,679 registered voters. Kitur had been endorsed by a section of Ruto allies who were after ensuring the incumbent Keter fails to clinch the UDA ticket. The Nandi Hills had been accused of being UDA rivals' mole in the Ruto camp. Ruto's allies had asked voters to teach him a political lesson by ejecting him out of office. Among the leaders who publicly campaigned against MP  Keter include Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, Soy's Caleb Kositany and MP Didmus Barasa. Deputy President William Ruto's Director of Communications Emmanuel Talam had also asked voters to reject Keter. The win now boosts his chances of retaining the seat in the August 9, polls. UDA returning officer Veronica Chebii said Keter will be handed the interim nomination certificate on Wednesday.
