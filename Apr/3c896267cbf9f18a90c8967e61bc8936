Posta Rangers deepened Vihiga Bullets' relegation woes after pipping them 1-0 in an action-packed Kenyan Premier League encounter at Bukhungu Stadium on Saturday. Posta's fleet-footed offensive midfielder Brian Marita found the back of the net a few minutes before the breather to help his side secure the maximum points. Vihiga had gone into the match high on confidence following an impressive run in their last four games where they went unbeaten. It was a game that largely witnessed a lot of missed chances with both sides squandering glaring opportunities in front of goal. The defeat leaves Bullets rooted 16th on the log and staring at relegation. Editing by Tony Mballa
