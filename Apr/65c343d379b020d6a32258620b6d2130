Today, I recognise all the men out there who are feeling like they have no one to turn to, Ida Odinga has said. Ida sent the message of hope to all men on her Twitter account on Friday. "Statistics sadly reveal that men live shortened lives due to stress related lifestyles... I want to assure you that you’re not alone," Ida said. Her tweet attracted various comments from her followers. Concerns have been raised on exclusion of the boy child which has crippled the dream to achieve gender equality. Last week, Narc Kenya Party Leader Martha Karua while addressing a crowd said that boys need their fathers during their teenage age. "It is not because of the girl child that the boy child is getting lost. Boys need their fathers as role models..or a father figure in their lives," she said. Karua further urged the men to look after each other saying that a mother is not enough as a role model.
