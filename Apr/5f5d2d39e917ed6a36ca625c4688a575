The body of the late retired President Mwai Kibaki arrived at Othaya Approved School from Nairobi on the road minutes past 10 am expected time. The casket was received by military officials of different disciplines. The officers dressed in white are Navy officials, red is the Kenya Defense Forces and those in blue are Kenya Air Forces. Kibaki's casket was escorted to Othaya by the military. The third Commander in Chief will be honoured with a 19 Gun Salute before being laid to final rest. The second late President Moi was accorded the same 19 Gun Salute back in 2020. Retired Heads of State are accorded 19 salutes unless the incumbent President says otherwise.
