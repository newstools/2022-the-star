Bunyore Starlets might not honour their Kenya Women's Premier League match against Thika this Sunday due to financial challenges, coach Zachariah Amakhanga has revealed. Amakhanga said the team is yet to settle last month's debts and the delayed disbursement of funds by the Caretaker Committee has rendered them broke. The retired justice Aaron Ringera-led committee allocated each club Sh600,000 for the January and February logistical support but the funds were insufficient for the daily operations. "WPL clubs are suffering. We expect many to give walkovers this weekend because they are bankrupt," Amakhanga said. He added: "It will be hard for us to travel to Thika on Saturday unless a miracle happens. We may seek postponement of the match because we don't want to pile debts. We borrowed money last month that we are yet to refund." Forwards Shalyne Onjote (knee) and Juliana Kaupe (head) are unavailable for Bunyore after sustaining injuries against Wadadia last weekend. Onjote suffered a concussion after colliding with Wadadia's goalkeeper. The duo will be out for a while, according to Amakhanga. Onjote and Keupe were instrumental in the team's promotion to the top tier last season and any extended period on the sidelines will be a big blow to the mid-table team. Elsewhere, Kangemi Ladies will be without Lucy Kazo (midfielder), Mary Atieno (attacker), and goalkeeper Ursula Nasimiyu when they play Trans-Nzoia Falcons in Kitale on the same day. The trio has been given extended break after their Form Four examinations but are expected back for the Kisumu All-Starlets tie next weekend. Kangemi coach Joseph Odhiambo said he has a fully fit squad that is ready to guide them to their first win of the second leg. The tail-enders have only managed one win in 12 matches and relegation looks inevitable. "It will be a good match considering we have all our best players back, something that we lacked against Ulinzi last weekend," Odhiambo said.
