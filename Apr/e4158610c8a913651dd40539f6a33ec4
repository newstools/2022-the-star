Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku for the Mombasa Law Court has pushed the case that's implicating Aisha Jumwa, and six others to August 15 through to 17th. The witnesses who testified against the Malindi Member of Parliament will testify afresh on the new dates. This comes after the trial Magistrate Edna Nyaloti got transferred to the Nakuru Law Court, making it difficult for her to travel between Nakuru,  and Mombasa to hear the case. Shadrack Wambui, and Danstan Omari, the lawyers for Jumwa had withdrawn their services after they differed with the court, on the hearing dates last year. However, they later took up the case. Following magistrate Edna Nyaloti's transfer, the lawyers had also asked the court to have the matter heard by another magistrate. Jumwa is charged alongside six co-accused who include; Wachu Omar Abdalla (Malindi CDF Account Manager), Kennedy Otieno Onyango, Bernard Riba Kai, Sophia Saidi Charo, and Margaret Faith Kalume, who are members of the Malindi Tender Evaluation Committee, as well as Robert Katana Wanje, a Director of Multserve Contractors Limited. Together, they are charged with 13 offenses including forgery, fraud in procurement, and money laundering.
