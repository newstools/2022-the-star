Naiboi is no longer under the Universal music label contract. The '2 in 1' hitmaker announced his comeback after revealing he is now free to release his songs. "Been a tough three-year situation. But hey, why complain when I can killem widdit?" he wrote. Late last year, the singer explained to his fans why he had not been releasing music consistently like before. He alleged that some external forces have been diminishing his progress. He said he had almost 800 unreleased songs, making him feel like his music career was coming to an end. "All I ever wanted is to release music for my fans. And I know my fans are wondering what happened to Naiboi. My hands have been tied for almost two years now," he wrote. In the post, Naiboi mentioned that he would involve a lawyer. "And I am tired of being at mercy. I miss Naiboi as much as you do. Pray for me," he said. "I keep everything to myself a lot. But I've come to an end. I love music so much it hurts me. I have almost 800 songs, I can't release even a single one of them."
