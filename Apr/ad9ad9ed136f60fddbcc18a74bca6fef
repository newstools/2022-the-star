The Mozambican authorities are detaining two men found attempting to sell severed male human genitals for 35 million kwachas (Sh. 4.8 million,$42,000; £33,000). The organs are reported to belong to a man who was murdered in Milange area in Zambézia province that borders Malawi. The suspected traffickers, aged 29 and 32 respectively, are said to have contacted a local trader and proposed to him to buy the organs. The trader, António Chicopa, contacted the local authorities who subsequently laid an ambush on the suspects. The two suspects are in police custody waiting to be taken to court. Mr Chicopa said he has since been shunned by people for his role in the arrests. “I was the one who alerted the police when those men told me about the deal. I took the head of [police] operations to the scene, along with other police officers. I don't know why today I'm being accused by people,” he is quoted as saying by local media outlet, Opais. Milange district commander, Alice Evaristo, said police were still investigating the matter. “I confirm the occurrence and that a person was murdered and his organs removed. This is real and we are working to get details of the case,” he said.
