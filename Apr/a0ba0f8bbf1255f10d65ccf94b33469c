The Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party has nullified the nomination of Gem MP Elisha Odhiambo. In a statement on Sunday, the party, through its official Facebook handle, said that it had resolved to instead issue a direct ticket. "Following the consultation of the Central Committee of the party, the party primary election in respect to Gem Constituency, Siaya County, as conducted on 13th April 2022 is hereby nullified," the statement read in part. Following the nomination, which was conducted through universal suffrage, the current MP Odhiambo had been declared the winner with 7,405 votes. His only challenger, Jalang'o Midiwo had garnered 6,384. Jalang'o had appealed against Odhiambo's win citing violence and irregularities during the voting exercise. The ODM Appeals Tribunal, sitting in Kisumu, had withheld the nomination of Odhiambo last week but Jalang'o applied for a review. Even though the Orange party did not state who is to be issued the direct ticket, it is expected that Jalang'o is going to be the beneficiary. Jalang'o is the elder brother to the late former Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo and cousin to ODM party leader Raila Odinga. Odhiambo had Sunday posted on his social media handles that he had finally won the nomination certificate. "The Appeals Tribunal has again dismissed the review application filed by Jalang'o Midiwo. My win has been upheld for the third time. Gem people have won," he wrote on Facebook.
