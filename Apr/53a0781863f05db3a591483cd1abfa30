Nyamira governor hopeful Walter Nyambati and his running mate Erneo Nyakiba have become the first aspirants in the county to run web-based campaigns. Nyambati and Nyakiba unveiled their campaign website on Monday as well as their integrated social media campaigns which they said will be targeting majority young people whom they identified as key population in the county. The website will be mainly focusing on various issues, ranging from making public the manifesto of the duo, to making known itineraries of their physical campaigns. The website will also be embedded with interactive social media platforms, which will be used to facilitate feedbacks based on chats and conversations that will be generated from the online audience. The website will be featuring live activities, including rallies and other public engagements the aspirants will be having during the campaigns period. Nyambati said the website and the digital campaigns are part of his strategies of harnessing followers among young people who are the majority voters. “Youths form the largest population of voters who have full access to information communication technologies and this web-based campaigns are tailored mainly to find them where they are most available," Nyambati said. During the launch, youths drawn from across the county engaged the two in a live session that was streamed live through the website as well as the YouTube platform. The two are competing against nine contestants who are awaiting clearance by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The aspirants include incumbent Amos Nyaribo, former assistant minister Joseph Kiangoi, Strathmore’s  and Industrial Engineering don Reuben Marwanga and former Kitutu Masaba MPs Timothy Bosire. Others are Mwancha Okioma, Borabu MP Ben Momanyi, US-based advocate Henry Ongeri and his fellow diaspora doctor Gideon Moseti.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
