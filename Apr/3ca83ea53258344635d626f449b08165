The Orange Democratic Movement party has commenced a survey to establish the most popular gubernatorial aspirant in Siaya. The latest move could be a demonstration of resilience by the Raila Odinga-led party to issue a direct ticket even as a similar move sparked a row in Homa Bay. The ODM National Elections Board had announced April 13, as the date for the party primaries in the county. The Star has confirmed that ODM sent SMSs to registered members on Wednesday asking who they will be voting for. "Who will you vote for in 2022 as Siaya governor? Reply with: 170 for Bella Akinyi, 171 for James Orengo and 172 for George Mugoye. Reply is free," reads the survey question. But the Star could not establish whether all registered ODM members in Siaya received the message. Siaya Deputy Governor James Okumbe's name was not included in the survey. Okumbe had announced that he was in the race. Former police spokesperson Charles Owino had earlier decamped from the ODM saying he had been implored to support a different candidate. He has since teamed up with former Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo. Gumbo and Owino will contest against the ODM nominee on August 9 general election under the United Democratic Movement. Siaya county ODM branch chairperson Oloo Okanda did not dismiss the possibility of a direct ticket. "The ODM is like a private members club and it chooses whomever it wants," he said. Okanda affirmed that the party, by law, can decide to use universal suffrage, consensus, delegates system or direct ticketing in picking its nominees. Word has it that Orengo, Akinyi and Mbeya recently met party honchos in Nairobi and the popularity of each one of them was discussed. It is alleged that it is from the meeting that the decision to conduct a survey was reached. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
