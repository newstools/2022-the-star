The government has made changes to the funeral programme of the late retired President Mwai Kibaki regarding the public viewing of his body. The national state funeral steering committee had initially said that members of the public would be allowed to view the body at parliament buildings on Tuesday and Wednesday between 9 am and 5 pm. But the plans changed on Monday after the arrival of the body at Parliament Buildings. After all state officials led by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto finished viewing the body, Kenyans were allowed to enter the precincts of Parliament to also view the body. Kibaki's body will lie-in-State in Parliament from Monday, April 25, to Wednesday, April 27, ahead of the State Funeral on Friday at Nyayo National Stadium. Kibaki will be buried on Saturday, April 30, at his Othaya home in Nyeri County. The third President will be accorded full military honours and protocols, which include conveyance of the body in a Gun Carriage, accompanied by Military Musical Honours and a 19 gun-salute.
