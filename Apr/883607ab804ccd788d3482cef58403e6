Former Africa 10,000m champion Kenneth Kipkemoi return to the Rotterdam Marathon this Sunday to reclaim the title he won in 2018. Kipkemoi is returning after serving two years for anti-doping rules violation in 2020. “I am back and ready to rumble again in the marathon. I have served my ban and I am looking forward to a good race,” he said. Kipkemoi won the 10,000m title at the 2012 Africa Championships in Port Novo, Benin, and silver in 10,000m at 2011 All Africa Games in Maputo, Mozambique. Despite serving his ban, Kipkemoi remains adamant that he did not dope. He is expected to face off with compatriots Reuben Kiprop, Olympic Games marathon bronze medallist and defending champion Abdi Bashir, former champion and last year's silver medalist Marius Kipserem, Ethiopian Dawit Wolde, and Richard Douma among others. In the women's category, Kenya's Stella Barsosio will be seeking to defend her title. Barsosio, who overcame a road accident three years ago, won the 42km title in 2:22.08 ahead of homegirl Nataliya Lehonkove (2:30.28) and former Ljubljana marathon champion Bornes Kitur (2:30.41).
