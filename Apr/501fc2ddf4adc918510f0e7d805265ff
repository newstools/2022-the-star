The Commonwealth Games in Birmingham will be held in July while the World Cup Sevens is slated for South Africa in September. Oloo, the Nakuru RFC coach, expects a competitive qualification process. “It's going to be exciting with tickets to the Club Games and World Cup to fight for. It will be tough but the girls are more than ready for the challenge. We have a couple of days left to finalise our preparations,” added Oloo. The tactician observed that the Sevens game is unpredictable and his charges can't afford to underestimate anyone.
