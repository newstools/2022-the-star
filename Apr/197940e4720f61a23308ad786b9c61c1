Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick said he has already had told the Premier League club's board what changes need be made to the squad in the close season transfer window and he was willing to discuss them with his successor. Rangnick, 63, will be interim manager until the end of the season before taking up a consultancy role with the club for a further two years. United are searching for a permanent manager, with British media reporting that Ajax Amsterdam boss Erik ten Hag is the likely candidate for the top job. "I have told (the board) how I see the current squad and what needs to happen in my opinion," Rangnick told reporters. "I spoke regularly with board members and they know what I think needs to happen in the summer. "If he is interested and willing to speak about that and interested in my opinion I will see what happens," he said, referring to the next manager. The German added that he had agreed upon a contract for his advisory role, saying final details would be worked out by the end of the season. "We have agreed upon a contract as an adviser and we will speak about that in the next couple of weeks, I'm pretty sure," Rangnick said. "At the latest, at the end of the season, but right now my full focus is on tomorrow." Seventh-placed United will be looking to keep their hopes of a top-four finish alive when they travel to 17th-placed Everton later on Saturday.
