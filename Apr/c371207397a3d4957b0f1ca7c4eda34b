betPawa BIG winner Rophus Mwachia brought a borehole to his area after being awarded an extra prize to support a local cause. The water plant engineer bet KSh93.02 on 24 legs and cashed out for KSh211,896.09 (before tax). betPawa’s new Win BIG, Give Back initiative saw the betting company hand Rophus a further KSh700,000 for his community. The Taita-Taveta County resident said: “It is a very dry area and most of our neighbours walk for 3-5 hours to get water. “I'm hoping that, with my support, my community can start irrigation farming so we can get enough food locally and upgrade our living standards," Mwachia said. “The chance to give back to the community is a great pleasure which has only been made possible by betPawa. I can't begin to thank betPawa enough. My community and I are greatly appreciative,” the water plant engineer concluded. Could you be the next person to win BIG and give back?
