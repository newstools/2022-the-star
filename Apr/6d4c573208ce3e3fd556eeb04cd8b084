Kenya Police stalwart Samuel Oungo is keen on molding young players at the club before hanging up his boots in the next two years. Oungo, who has managed four goals in as many games in the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League, said he wants to concentrate on coaching in the next two years. Police are second on the log with seven points from four matches with  Oungo scoring half of the team's goals so far. The former Kisumu Simba Club (now Butali) player has enjoyed a trophy-laden career with Police since 2008 when he joined the outfit. His 14 years have yielded five national league titles for a player now in the twilight of his career but like fine wine, he continues to silence his critics. "I want to ensure that the likes of Robert Masibo, Kennedy Sibwoche, and Victor Wekesa not only improve but become dependable. They are young and it is a pleasure to train and play with them," Oungo hinted. He added: "I believe I still have about two years to thrive in the league before retiring. I coach the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology men's team which play in the Super League. Being a long-term project, I want to ensure they play in the top tier as soon as possible." Commenting on his current form, he said: "It's all about hard work in training and mastering the basics. The team comes first for me. I want to score at least eight goals but Police are all about fighting for titles and that is what we are working on." He said Police are an experienced team that has mastered the art of winning even when they are not playing well. "The likes of Willis Okeyo, Richard Birir, and Moses Cheplaiti have been long in the game and have become pillars to the team. They have won a lot and we hope to win again this season." Oungo said Chelsea's Thiago Silva is his role model because of the leadership qualities the Brazilian offers on and off the field. "He is the unsung hero of the Blues backline. His composure with and without the ball is unmatched."
