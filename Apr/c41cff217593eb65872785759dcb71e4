Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali is urging residents to re-elect him based on his performance record. Governor Ali said it is prudent that he be given a second term to finish his development projects. He spoke on Sunday while on a development tour in Sololo subcounty. Ali said he has done a lot that qualifies him to be re-elected on August 9. He said more than 1,000 students are in different high schools courtesy of his scholarship programme. The county boss said he has also undertaken various water, roads and health projects. This, he says, includes the construction of the KMTC and Sololo Level 4 Hospital. "When I became governor, Marsabit Referral Hospital had no specialist. I tried my best and brought it back to the limelight. I want to humbly ask you to back my re-election," he said. Ali said he will initiate other projects and expand the scholarship kitty to ensure more needy students have access to education. He also asked residents to rally behind ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid, saying he is optimistic the Azimio leader will win. He said under Raila's leadership, there will be more resources for development and economic empowerment. The county boss said there is need for leaders to be at the forefront in fostering unity and coexistence among residents. Ali said his opponents should conduct peaceful campaigns instead of dwelling on misplaced rivalry that impoverishes the electorate. Others in the race are Chachu Ganya of Kanu, Kello Harsam of UDA, Sunya Orre of ANC, Pius Yattani of UPIA, Wario Guyo and Lotto Segelan. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
