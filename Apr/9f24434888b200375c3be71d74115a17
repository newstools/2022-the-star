Kibera rapper Stivo Simple Boy's ex-girlfriend Purity Vishenwa, alias Pritty Vishi, says she cheated on Stivo three times. "I cheated on him with three wababas (elderly men). Two of them are celebrities and one of them is just a normal rich man," she told Word Is. Pritty said it was the first time she was coming out to say it as she had never told the ex-boyfriend. "I do not regret, neither will I apologise. He has moved on and I am single," she said. Adding, "There isn't anything I haven't seen. I was in a marriage that lasted for a month way before I met him." She came into the limelight when she defended the rapper for being mistreated by his label. Stivo has since parted ways with his former management.
