A news alert shared on Facebook claiming that Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Polycarp Igathe has withdrawn from the race is FAKE. The news alert contains the branding of a Kenyan broadcaster, NTV Kenya, and is dated April 25, 2022. An image of the Kenyan politician, who previously served as a deputy governor of Nairobi county, is attached. “Polycarp Igathe writes to President Uhuru seeking withdrawal from Nairobi race; cites unbearable pressure, constant extortion by cartels,” reads the text on the news alert. Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga last week announced that former Equity chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe will be the governor nominee of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party. He said he will be deputised by former Kibwezi MP Philip Kaloki. He said the coalition had resolved to field ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna as the Nairobi Senate candidate while Esther Passaris will defend her seat as Woman Representative. There is no information about the news alert on the NTV Kenya website, Facebook, and Twitter pages, where the broadcaster posts its news items. In a Facebook post on April 26, NTV Kenyadisowned the news alert and urged the public to disregard it. PesaCheck has examined the news alert claiming that Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant, Polycarp Igathe, has withdrawn from the race, and found it to be FAKE. Early this week, Igathe announced that the Azimio Nairobi team will officially begin campaigning in the capital next week as they seek to consolidate his support for the gubernatorial seat. Igathe will lead the team on an intense three-month campaign to sell Raila Odinga's coalition. “From next Wednesday, we will begin campaigns in Nairobi,  not as Jubilee or ODM. We shall go by the identity of Azimio," Igathe said on Wednesday at City Hall. (Edited by V. Graham)
