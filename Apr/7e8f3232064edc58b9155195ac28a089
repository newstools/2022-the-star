Political aspirants have been urged to uphold peace during and after polls in honour of former President Mwai Kibaki. Northeastern region commissioner James Kianda said the leaders should not use campaigns as a tool to divide Kenyans. The commissioner spoke to the press after signing the condolence book outside his office in Garissa town on Thursday. “We should strive to remain as one nation during and after the election. It is a humble request to our leaders seeking various elective posts in Northeastern,” Kianda said. He said after election we shall remain brothers and sisters and above all we will remain as one nation. “The challenges we are facing today will remain the same. There is no need of fighting and creating animosity among ourselves. We should hold a peaceful election,” the commissioner said. Kianda who was flanked by his regional security team and Garissa county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said the country has lost a great leader who strived to better the lives of Kenyans. Kibaki who passed away last Friday served for 10 years as head of state, from December 2002 to April 2013. The commissioner said Kibaki laid a strong economic foundation for our country, which contributed to the peace we are enjoying today. He said we must always remember that we are all Kenyans first. “I take this opportunity on behalf of residents of Northeastern, civil servants and my family to convey our heartfelt condolences to family, friends and Kenyans following the demise of our third president,” Kianda said. He further said his security team has had discussions with the Teacher’s Service Commission on security of teachers threatened by the al Shabaab terror group. The commissioner said the region has enjoyed relative peace in recent past and teachers posted to region will be safe. He said they will ensure that learning resumes in areas where tutors were withdrawn due to security concerns. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
