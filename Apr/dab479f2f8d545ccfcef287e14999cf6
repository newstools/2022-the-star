Netflix will be introducing a category of films that will be around 90 minutes long. The idea for the innovation was inspired by Pete Davidson’s latest sketch for Saturday Night Live. In the clip, American comedian Pete Davidson who often takes roles in small and large movies like ‘Suicide Squad’, rapper Gunna, Saturday Night Live comedian Chris Redd and actor Simon Rex (“Scary Movie” franchise) is seen rapping about why they love short movies that are under 90 minutes long. On the page, a user will find lists of movies organized by genre. It is currently not available for those using the free plan.
