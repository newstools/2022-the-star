Private media houses have been locked out of late President Mwai Kibaki's home in Othaya where he will be laid to rest. Only state-owned media KBC was granted access to his expansive home in Othaya, Nyeri county. Office of the President comptroller Mike Gitone said that the family requested the final send off to be private and that meant that a section of the public and the media had to be locked out. Gitone expressed his gratitude to the members of the press for beaming the event live to the world. "Thank you the media for the good work. But the ceremony at home is a private event and only those permitted will be allowed in." In a procession made from Othaya Approved school, Kibaki's body was escorted by the military to his residence. Kibaki will be accorded a 19 gun salute as the Military's last respects to him. The ceremony at home is expected to take about an hour. Kibaki died on Friday, April 22 at the age of 91. He is survived by four children; one daughter and three sons. The late President had seven grandchildren. In the tributes paid earlier during the ceremony and throughout the week, Kibaki was described as a patient and excellent man, and a statesman. Different speakers have urged Kenyans and leaders to emulate his example.
