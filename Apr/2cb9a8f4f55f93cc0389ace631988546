Interior CS Fred Matiang'i has declared Tuesday as a public holiday to celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr. In a gazette notice on Tuesday, Matiang'i declared May 3rd a public holiday in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2 (1) of the Public Holidays Act. The festival of Idd-ul-Fitr, the Festival of Fast-breaking, is an important religious holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. Muslims celebrate Idd-ul-Fitr with prayers called "Salat Al Eid" in Arabic. Muslims gather in mosques or open spaces and offer two units of prayer – called "Rakat". The prayers are followed by a sermon, in which the imam asks for forgiveness, mercy, and peace for every being across the world.
