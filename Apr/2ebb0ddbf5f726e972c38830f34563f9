St. Ignatius High school Mukumu is set to host a two-day Talent Search tournament courtesy of American Soccer School scheduled for next week. According to the veteran coach Gilbert Selebwa, who doubles up as a facilitator, Montverde Soccer Academy will send their chief scout Mike Potempa to oversee the process scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Speaking from Kakamega town on Wednesday, Selebwa said experienced coach John Bob Oyugi, who is also the convener, will also be part of the team. "We are seeking to reach out to many talented stars at the grassroots level and I hope they will be given opportunities to shine at the international level," he noted. The programme seeks to offer promising players scholarships to study abroad with players from the vast western region as the main target. "Western and Nyanza regions remain key as far as soccer development in the country is concerned and we are optimistic of getting a good number of young players. "We also hope that they will not only join the Montverde Academy but also secure scholarships to pursue their education," he said. He appealed to parents to support their children and ensure they attend the function that is likely to actualise their football dream. Mukumu Boys High School head of sports, Anthony Wekesa, said they are ready to host the event that will give players the opportunity to shine at top level. Selebwa, who formerly handled AFC Leopards and Shabana, revealed that he was expecting close to 500 players for a two-day event.
