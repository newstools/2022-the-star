Twitter has said it is experimenting a new feature that will allow users to remove a “mention” in conversations. A mention is a Tweet that contains another person's username anywhere in the body of the Tweet. “We’re experimenting with unmentioning—a way to help you protect your peace and remove yourself from conversations—available on Web for some of you now,” they said. This feature is limited to some users and it is currently only available in the web version. The user will leave the tagged conversation without necessarily asking to be removed, by clicking on the menu that pops out of the corner of a tweet on the web version of Twitter. Once you ‘leave the conversation’, all notifications are stopped at once and most importantly, you make a graceful exit without harassment
