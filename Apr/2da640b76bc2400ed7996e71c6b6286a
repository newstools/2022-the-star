Deputy President William Ruto has said the August 9, general election is a contest of ideas about fixing the economy. He noted that Kenya Kwanza Alliance has prioritized economic issues for the sake of millions of struggling Kenyans. “The greatest challenge we are facing as a country is the poor state of our economy. We will use this year’s election to fix our economy, ” he said. Speaking in Mathira, Nyeri County during the burial of Mary Wamuyu, Ruto said he was working with like-minded Kenyans to bring to an end the era of an economic model that excludes a majority of Kenyans. Ruto said the country’s deteriorating economy has driven a majority of Kenyans into poverty, a situation he said needs urgent intervention. The Deputy President assured Kenyans that the country will hold peaceful elections come August 9. Present were Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, MPs Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), John Wanjiku (Kiambaa) and Githua Wamacukuru (Kabete). Kahiga urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to secure his legacy without harassing fellow leaders. Nyoro said the people of Mt Kenya will not be swayed to support ODM Party leader Raila Odinga. “When I listen to the people on the ground, they have settled on DP Ruto, he is the most popular presidential candidate,” he said. Gachagua reiterated that Mt Kenya residents will stick with the UDA flagbearer because he has the best interest of the region at heart. “We are relying on you. Since our President ditched us for ODM, we have no one to turn to, you are our only hope.” The Kiambaa MP affirmed the remarks of both Nyoro and Gacahagua. Wamacukuru lauded Ruto for standing up for the people despite threats and blackmail while Kahiga said politicians whose parties did not conduct party primaries have no moral authority to lecture UDA over its nomination exercise. “It is laughable that those who did not even attempt to conduct party primaries are now lecturing us.”
