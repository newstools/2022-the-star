His son, Barack Owino, who had just completed his KCSE exams at Ulumbi Secondary School arrived home and received the sad news after waiting for his bus fare in vain.

Owino said that the hospital called him on Tuesday instructing him to pay Sh30,000 immediately for the body to be released from the morgue.

The mortuary charges cost Sh300 per day and another Sh3,500 for embalmment. The deceased has been at the morgue for 26 days, as of April 26. Add to the Sh30,000, Owino needs Sh11,300 more, totalling Sh41,300. Owino had earlier paid Sh5,000 to the facility. As of Tuesday, Owino had received about Shh10,000 from online well-wishers, after the Star shared his story. “I am thankful that strangers have been contributing for me and the hospital has also waived the greatest part of the bill,” he told the Star.
