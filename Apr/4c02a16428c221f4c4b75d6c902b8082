The Somaliland business community is mobilizing support from the international community to help raise funds to rebuild the expansive Waheen market that was razed to the ground. An estimated cost of over $2 billion (Sh230.4 tillion) was lost in the weekend inferno. The business community has already contributed substantial funds towards reconstruction efforts of the market, considered one of the largest and busiest in the horn of Africa. Many of the traders in the market had financial links with other parts of the world including the Gulf, China, Asia and Europe.Traders from Kenya are among those affected by the fire. Also affected were women who ran small businesses to support their families. The cost of rebuilding the infrastructure and destroyed businesses is believed to be in the region of $5 billion (Sh576 trillion) with the government and the business commun​ity now rallying for support from across the globe. The tragedy struck when the region is suffering one of the worst droughts in decades, recording the driest season in 40 years. It came on the eve of the holy month of Ramadan, a period when traders import huge quantities of food and other goods, all of which have been lost. It is feared that from the tragedy, the city and its environs will face a severe shortage of food and other commodities which was already being felt due to the war in Ukraine. The Kenyan government sent its message of sympathy on Monday to those affected.The Ministry of foreign Affairs affirmed in a statement that Kenya shares a common heritage and strong bonds of friendship with Somaliland. "It is with deep regret that we have learnt of the tragic accident that occurred in Waheen market in Hargeisa on the night of 1st April 2022. The Government and the people of Kenya stand in solidarity with the people of Somaliland and extend sympathies to the victims and families of the injured," the ministry said in a statement. The Somaliland community in Kenya will on Sunday hold a fundraiser in Nairobi to raise funds towards the reconstruction efforts. The fund raiser has been organized by the community and the Somaliland Representative office in Nairobi.
