The Ministry of Education has explained the reasons why a special group of students who sit for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education exams are not placed in high schools. Early Learning and Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said the students sat their exams either in prisons or as private candidates, hence the government could not place them in secondary schools during the selection. "Pupils under the two categories are not suitable for Form One placement," he said. He further said that most of the students under the two categories who enrol for the exams write them so that they can have the KCPE certificate. “They later pursue vocational training courses using the certificates while others continue with secondary education as private students,” he said. At least 900 inmates wrote the 2021 KCPE exam. So far, the Ministry of Education noted that 1,209,697 candidates have been placed in high schools Magoha did not give a way forward for the learners who did not secure slots in high schools. Every year, a number of learners register to sit for the KCPE exams as private candidates. The government in an effort to boost education allows inmates to also expand their knowledge while serving their sentences. He said their selection was based on affirmative action and was purely on merit.
