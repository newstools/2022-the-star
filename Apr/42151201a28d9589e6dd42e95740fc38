Chaos marred UDA nominations in Embakasi Central as voters protested the delays in the commencement of the exercise at polling stations. At Kayole One Primary School in Kayole North Ward, anti-riot police had to be called to restore order after voters threatened to attack election officials. Voters complained the clerks were too slow as very few had cast their ballots by 1 pm. "They are allowing only four people to go in at a time. The four who go in again take about 20 minutes to vote," an agent for an MCA aspirant who sought anonymity said. Women said they had left their children at home unattended and had hoped the exercise would go on smoothly. "It's one o'clock and almost all of us have not voted despite being here early. We have pregnant women and persons with disabilities who have been queuing for hours," a woman said. The angry residents stood in long queues under the scorching sun waiting to vote. However, the two classrooms being used as voting stations were locked from inside with aspirants and agents for hours. Wailing and shouting as they protested the locking of rooms became the order of the day for almost three hours. “I came here as early as 7 am, but I have not voted because they have locked the doors from inside... We are asking why are they locking us out yet we are the voters?” posed Josepth Kariuki. “I came here with my two-year-old but I have not voted for my aspirant...We have not been addressed on the way forward,” said Quinter Macharia. “We can't understand why the door is locked and that is why we will reject the exercise,” Samson Ndung’u. The residents claimed rigging schemes by different aspirants. As the residents protested, armed police arrived at the scene in three land rovers to bring order. At the sight of armed police with guns, helmets and batons, some of the residents left the voting stations while others remained, determined to vote for their aspirants.
