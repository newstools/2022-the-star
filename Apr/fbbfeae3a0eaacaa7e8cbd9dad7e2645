Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu has dismissed reports that she was coerced into shelving plans to defend the seat and support Polycarp Igathe. In a tweet on Friday, Kananu said the decision to shelve her gubernatorial bid was a personal decision. "The decision was not made for me and I was not coerced. These wannabe bloggers should get their facts straight and leave me alone," Kananu said. "Acha propaganda. Achana na mimi," she added. (Stop propaganda. Leave me alone). Kananu announced that she would no longer be defending her seat after the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya gubernatorial candidate Polycarp Igathe paid her a courtesy visit on Wednesday, April 27. While throwing her support behind Igathe, Kananu pledged to join his campaign team as he embarks on grassroots campaign across the city's 17 subcounties. "I want to assure Igathe that we will campaign together and shall not sleep until you get to be sworn in as the governor," Kananu said. The incumbent city administrator stated that she accepted President Uhuru Kenyatta and former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's decision of settling on Igathe as the flag bearer for the city's top job. "I respect my party leaders for the decision they made and I agree to step aside and support Polycarp Igathe in his bid to become the fourth governor of Nairobi," Kananu said. She assured Igathe of a smooth transition if he wins the gubernatorial race.
