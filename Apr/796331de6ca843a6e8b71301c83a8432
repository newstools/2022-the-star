Kevin Muasya, son of Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, has teamed up with former Ambassador to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo in Kitui Governor race. His entry follows a decision by Kilonzo to front him as his preferred running mate for the Kitui Governor race on the Wiper party ticket. Kalonzo is now faced with a dilemma on how to give the Wiper ticket without encountering a fallout within the party. Former Kitui Governor Julius Malombe is also eyeing the Wiper Party ticket. In a scientific poll that was conducted by the party, a Malombe candidature seems to be more popular that the Kilonzo-Muasya ticket. Malombe led with a 60% score compared to Kilonzo who enjoys only about 8% support from the local voters. Former Kitui Senator David Musila and former Nairobi deputy governor Mr Jonathan Mueke have also entered the contest. Musila, who decamped to the Jubilee party after discrediting the poll, managed 21 per cent support. Speaking during the launch of his manifesto a week ago, Malombe said it would be a waste of time and resources to go for nominations with an aspirant who has scored below 10 per cent. Wiper officials are now plotting for a consensus between Malombe and Kilonzo but the ambassador and his running mate maintain that they are the best team. The Wiper party has not made a decision on who to endorse or give a preferred lineup for the Kitui governor seat. Muasya becomes the latest son of the former Vice President who has expressed interest to extend his father's legacy.
