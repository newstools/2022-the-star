The family of a 24-year-old woman who was gang-raped and murdered last week in Karatina, Nyeri, wants the police to arrest her killers. The family said no arrests had been made following the death of Sheila Adhiambo who was closely associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. According to reports on social media, a group of men who didn’t agree with the deceased's support of lesbianism were responsible for her death. It is alleged that last week, the unknown persons raided Adhiambo's home, raped and murdered her. The family has already transferred her body to the Naivasha Subcounty hospital mortuary, ahead of the burial. In a tweet, Amnesty International condemned the murder and vowed to stand with the family, saying no one deserved such treatment. “We shall follow up this matter until justice is served,” they said. John Lumumba, the father of the deceased said they were in agony as their daughter died a painful death. He said her house and personal effects were soaked in blood meaning, she bled a lot before dying. Lumumba said a post mortem on the body showed Adhiambo died after being hit by a blunt object on the head and she had stab wounds on her neck and eyes. “There are many rumours around her death including a fallout with some workmates but we are asking for justice,” he said. Mother Millicent Oloo termed the murder as the most painful thing that had ever occurred in the family. “My daughter died a very painful death, her house was covered in blood and we are calling on police to arrest those behind this heinous act,” she said. The murder elicited anger on social media with calls to respect the LGBT community which has faced backlash from some members of the public.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
