Embu UDA nomination officials want the party leaders to pay their two-day wages. The officials, who included presiding officers and clerks, said they were promised to be paid on Monday but the party didn't honour the agreement. The officials spoke to the media at Embu town on Wednesday. Nickson Gitonga, who served as presiding officer, said they were supposed to earn Sh7,500 while clerks would get Sh4,000. "Only a few officials have received Sh2,500 and Sh1,000, while others like me have received nothing," he said. He said the party should pay their dues as promised, adding that the constituency party officials who appointed them have gone missing. "We urge our leaders who are creating jobs among youths to consider also paying us," Gitonga said. Erick Mawira said he served as the clerk in one of the centres and is yet to receive his dues. He said party officials should pay their dues and avoid giving lame excuses. "We did everything right. It doesn't make sense to have given all the details right and then miss out on pay," Mawira said. He said the party should portray the real image of considering the common Kenyans and not blackmail the weak. "Let it be seen that the party is dedicated towards the youths. Let's see it honour the wages of hustlers'," Mawira said. The youths however said they are still loyal to the party they worked for and said all they request is their wages. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
