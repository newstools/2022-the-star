People with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or acid reflux usually experience these symptoms mostly at night. If you are suffering from this disease, just know that you are not alone, in fact, GERD affects up to 13 per cent of the global population at least once a week. 25 per cent of people actually experience the symptoms at night because the acid moves back to a person’s oesophagus while lying down. This leads to sleep deprivation as the symptoms can be intense. Research shows that acid reflux usually happens in the first two or three hours of sleep, especially after consuming a very heavy meal two hours before bedtime. Here are the best sleeping positions for people with this condition A 2015 study suggests that sleeping on your left side at an inclined sleeping position makes acid reflux at night almost impossible because the food pipe is well-positioned. The food pipe should be above your stomach so that by any chance you have acid reflux, gravity can return the contents back to your stomach, protecting the food pipe, throat, and lungs from prolonged acid exposure. People with acid reflux are not supposed to sleep on their back because studies show that they will easily exhibit symptoms more frequently when in this position. The symptoms also tend to last longer because the acid cannot flow back to the stomach. By keeping your neck raised, as long as your torso is inclined, nighttime acid reflux is minimized. Sleeping at an incline means sleeping with your head elevated 6 to 8 inches off your body by putting extra pillows under your head and upper back. Not only does poor sleep position cause acid reflux, but consuming fatty or spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine can also trigger it. Also, smoking, stress, pregnancy, and taking some medicines can cause acid reflux. It is important to consult with your doctor if you experience symptoms that may be disturbing your sleep and day-to-day activities.
