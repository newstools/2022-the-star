After a steady three weeks, crypto has taken a plunge. Crypto prices tanked in the past few days, sending the values of digital tokens plummeting to low levels. Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the $250 billion crypto crash. Bitcoin was trading near $47,000 early last week but then fell under $45,000 last Wednesday. The price slipped under $40,000 Wednesday morning. The plunge comes amid predictions by experts that Bitcoin's price could hit $100,000 by end of 2022 - and this being a matter of when, not if.
