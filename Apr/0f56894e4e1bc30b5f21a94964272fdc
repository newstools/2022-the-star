Deputy President William Ruto has affirmed that voting in the 36 counties is proceeding smoothly after the logistical challenges were dealt with. Speaking on Twitter, he lauded the 5,000 UDA aspirants for their patience and for maintaining peace so far. "The number of elective seats being contested is 888 with 49,811 election officials in 16,513 polling centres engaged," Ruto said. UDA NEB board chairperson Anthony Mwaura also expressed satisfaction with the exercise despite chaotic incidences witnessed in some areas. Earlier, the residents of Bomet County had raised concerns over the transportation of ballots with police escorts. There were also claims of fake papers, an allegation that was dismissed by the party's election board. The UDA party primary nominations began on Thursday morning with 11 counties not participating in the exercise. The exercise was suspended in the Bumula, Kakamega County, Mt Elgon and parts of Turkana, citing chaos. Nominations in Kakamega and Mt Elgon will be conducted on Friday. The Board suspended primaries in Nandi Hill, Narok South and Nakuru Town West constituencies until April 19. The Nandi Hills nomination was halted after the aspirant died in a road accident.
