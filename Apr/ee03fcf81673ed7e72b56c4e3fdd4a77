The Library of Congress recently revealed its 25 picks to be added to the National Recording Registry this year. Not all of the recordings are musical, such as a collection of Franklin D. Roosevelt's speeches, radio broadcasts from 9/11. Hank Aaron's 715th career home run and a 'WTF With Marc Maron' podcast featuring Robin Williams. Some notable musical selections include:. “The Christmas Song” — Nat King Cole (1961) (single). “Tonight's the Night” — The Shirelles (1961) (album). “Reach Out, I'll Be There” — The Four Tops (1966) (single).
