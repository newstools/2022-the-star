Motorists will now pay more to access the yet to be commissioned Nairobi Expressway. The governemnt has revised the toll rates up by 16 per cent.

The toll rates are set for future adjustments based on the prevailing exchange rate and changes in the consumer price index. By December 31, last year, the shilling was valued at Sh113.14 in contrast to Sh103.79 on December  31, 2020.
