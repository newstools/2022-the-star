Francis Muthaura, a former civil servant and close ally of former President Mwai Kibaki has eulogised Kibaki as an economist who focused on the essential areas of the economy that would turn the country’s GDP to a higher level. Muthaura is the former Head of Civil Service and Secretary to the Cabinet. In his tribute on Saturday during the last respect of the third president of Kenya, Muthaura said that Kibaki focussed on infrastructure that could connect all areas of the country. He said that Kibaki told his team during his helm as the president that the government should connect more Kenyans to the power, and connect villages and markets. Muthaura added that Kibaki managed to build the iconic Thika Super Highway amid controversy from a section of the politicians who wanted to politicise the project. He added that Kibaki empowered the private sector, civil service, military, and the judiciary during his time. In playing the regional role in East African Community, Muthaura said that Kibaki was at the centre stage in ensuring that Burundi is joined the community. “He pushed very hard to bring Burundi into the East African Community. The current president has now really pushed very heard accession of DRC into the community,” Muthaura said. Burundi joined the East African Community in July 2007, when Kibaki was serving his second term in office. “On the roads, after building the Thika Road with a lot of doubting Thomases, many people trusted Kenya. There is no project we would not implement under him.” He also said that Kibaki renovated Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) which suddenly became the most modern airport in Africa. “I remember when he was opening phase one of the modern JKIA, the World Bank representative said if you Kenyans can do a project like this so successful on your own resource, there is no project which you cannot implement.”
