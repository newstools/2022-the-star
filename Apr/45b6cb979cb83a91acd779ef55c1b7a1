With this cold Nairobi weather, there is nothing that will slurp like a hot carrot ginger soup. The soup is warm, hearty and packed with spicy ginger and creamy coconut. Preparation Step 1 Using a large pot over medium heat and add the vegetable oil and cook the carrots, onions and garlic. Step 2 Grate some ginger over the mixture and stir. Add in a pinch of salt and pepper and add the vegetable stock. Cover and simmer until soft. Step 3 Remove it from the heat and puree using a blender while it's hot. This will help give you a nice smooth texture Step 4 Return the puree to the sufuria and add the can of coconut milk (or milk/cream of your choice). Step 5 Combine the mixture, then add more salt and pepper, to your taste. Step 6 Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with a dollop of sour cream, Greek yogurt, coconut yogurt or a swirl of cream (or coconut cream). Enjoy with bread, naan, or serve as appetizer.
