Nandi County has once again made history by nominating two youthful politicians to its highest levels of leadership. Cynthia Muge, 27, captured United Democratic Alliance ticket to vie for Nandi woman representative while Josses Kiptoo Lemengit was nominated Emgwen constituency flagbearer. Lelmengit, 28, a civil engineer by profession polled 4,792 votes against his close rival Tesla Tum who got 4,200 votes. The low turn-out was associated with chaos witnessed in some polling stations and lack of ballot papers forcing presiding officers to improvise, denying many a chance to vote. Lelmengit was one time a personal assistant to Senator Samson Cherargei got his nomination certificate after a stand-off with Tum. Muge, who is was an independent elected MCA at the County Assembly of Nandi representing Kilibwoni ward has been outspoken on issues of governance. She a physical planner by profession and holds a masters degree in project planning management and a phD student. Muge trounced her two main competitors, Clara Meli and Ruth Bungei to become the third woman representative. The current woman representative Tecla Tum opted not to defend her position as woman representative and instead went for the Emgeen parliamentary seat which she lost to Lelmengit. Governor Stephen Sang and Senator Samson Cherargei and Cynthia Muge have all been handed with UDA nomination certificates.
