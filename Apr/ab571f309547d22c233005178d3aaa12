Pep Guardiola said he was shocked to hear Fernandinho had announced his decision to leave. Guardiola said: “Oh! I didn’t know. “You give me the news. I didn’t hear it. We will see what happens. I don’t know what will happen. He is so important. I’ll ask him.” Guardiola said Fernandinho has been “an incredible player for Manchester City”. The City boss added: “At the end of the season we talk, maybe it’s because of his family. I would love it. We will talk.” Fernandinho, who signed a one-year contract extension last summer, announced on Tuesday afternoon that he would be leaving Manchester City at the end of the current campaign, with his intention being to return to Brazil.
