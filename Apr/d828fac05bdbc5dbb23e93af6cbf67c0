Senators on Tuesday paid tribute to the late former President Mwai Kibaki who was pronounced dead by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday. Kibaki died at the age of 90 at his home in Othaya, Nyeri County. In his tribute, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula described Kibaki as a man who was not born great, but acquired greatness through sheer hard work, commitment and patriotism for his country. Wetangula noted that the late Kibaki was not selfish by virtue of being against the idea of public infrastructure projects being named after him. "We have many places that should be named after him. In fact, Senator Samuel Poghisio should bring a motion in this House, so that we name some national icons, one or two or three after this great man," Wetangula said. Wetangula added that Kibaki brought a working culture to Kenyans and preached that one did not have to steal to be rich. The Bungoma senator said Kibaki ensured the economy is steady and basic necessities are available for them. “He left Kenya when a bag of fertilizer was Sh1,800, today, a bag of fertilizer is Sh6,800. For the ten years, he was president, even during the troubles of 2007-2008, there were no petrol queues in this country,” Wetangula said. He added Kibaki believed in equity in distributing resources across the country. "Even as he did not go to many places, Mzee Kibaki would always ask his ministers, you've brought this project about this area, what about those other areas?" Senator Ephraim Maina eulogised Kibaki as a man who declared zero tolerance for corruption and who he did not spare even his closest friends.
