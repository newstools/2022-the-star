Commenting on his win, Kubwa said; “For the past Savannah Tours that I have participated in, I have been playing quite well, but my putting has been off. "So I have been working on improving my putting and today I sunk a lot of them. I hit the ball quite well, always closer to the pin. I have never played in a six-man playoff. It was quite challenging but I encouraged myself to go for it. I still need to work on my putting which is good but not great as I would want it to be." The tournament attracted a total of 68 professional and amateur golfers.
