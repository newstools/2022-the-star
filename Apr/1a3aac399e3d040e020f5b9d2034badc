Huge cheers erupted here at the election night HQ of Emmanuel Macron. French and EU flags waved wildly amongst supporters in this vast conference hall. Their man has made it through, as expected. Nerves had been jangling tonight with fears the first-round vote could prove wafer-thin close. Supporters tell us they’re pleased with the lead he’s managed but also that the incumbent will now need to be more present on the campaign trail. There’s work to do but overall tonight, a sense of relief. Cheers erupted just after 20:00 when the exit poll appeared on the screen. If that’s any indication, people here feel Le Pen has done very well. The reason being that this is the highest score she has achieved in the three presidential campaigns she has been involved in. In the last five minutes we've seen selies. There's champagne. Also spin. Some of the spin doctors here are going around saying, this is much better than we expected. There is certainly optimism here and they feel momentum is on their side as they press on to the second round.
