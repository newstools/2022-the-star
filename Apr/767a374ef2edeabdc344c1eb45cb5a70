Kisumu senate seat aspirant Lawyer Tom Ojienda has called for transparent and objective nominations results that reflect the will of the people. Ojienda said the electronic voting system was good and should remain very objective when final results are announced at Tom Mboya Labour College, which is the county's tallying centre. The Lawyer said the voter turnout was high in most places which to him is an indicator that the people want a change of leadership. Ojienda is battling for the ODM ticket against Philip Pande, nominated senator Rose Nyamunga, Ayiecho Olweny and Adul Mang'anga. He, however, called for the extension of voting time in the polling stations where the exercise started late. He said the electronic voting system embraced by the ODM party was simple, easy and faster for voters to elect leaders of their choice. "I have just voted of course for myself and I think the prospects are good. I can see a large crowd out here. I think that the turn up shows that not only the merger of stations but people want change because this is a very important exercise," Ojienda said. He noted that the turnout was high in most polling stations in Kisumu county except for a few stations in Kisumu West and Nyakach constituencies. "All members of ODM should just come out and vote for their favourite candidates on MCA, MP, Senate and Women rep seat," Ojienda said. He called on leaders especially aspirants to maintain peace and maximum security as the exercise continues. "We don't need to fight over nominations exercise. Let people decide and make a choice," Ojienda said. In areas where there were hitches, he said, the ODM elections board responded swiftly and addressed the matter. In the Wenwa polling centre, where 11 polling stations were merged, only one voting tablet was being used causing pressure and congestion. This also saw a stampede forcing police to use teargas to disperse the rowdy crowd.
