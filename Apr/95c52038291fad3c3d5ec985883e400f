The cost of living has gone up in the Kenya, with basic commodities proving to be rear. A spot check by the Star has revealed that milk prices have gone up with all brands adding between Sh5 to Sh10 for a 500ml packet. Tuzo milk is retailing at Sh53 from an average of Sh48. Ilara is selling at Sh55 from Sh48 while Molo is at Sh51 from Sh50 and Fresha at Sh50 from Sh45. In some supermarkets, they only allow consumers to pick six packets of milk. And the bite is not only on milk but also other commodities. The cost of eggs, tomatoes, cooking oil, onions, vegetables and other food items has pushed middle-class Kenyans to opt for other sustainable meal options. A crate of egg is currently retailing at Sh460 from Sh360 since February while one egg now retails at Sh15 to Sh17. It was initially Sh12. The rising cost of eggs has been attributed to low production occasioned by the high cost of chicken feeds. This is the plight of millions of Kenyans who are struggling to make ends meet, amid a rising cost of living.
