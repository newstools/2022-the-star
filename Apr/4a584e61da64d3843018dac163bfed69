On April 16, Billie Eilish took the stage at Coachella to become the youngest headliner in the music festival's history. Yahoo reports that the star took a moment in the middle of her set to thank fans for coming and to seemingly question her own place in the festival's lineup. "I should not be headlining this s***! But I'm so f***ing grateful that I'm here and that you guys are all here. This is such a dream come true. I feel crazy," Billie Eilish, Coachella, via Yahoo.
