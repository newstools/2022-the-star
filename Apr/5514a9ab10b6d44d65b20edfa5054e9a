Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has said that it has handed over to the government 39 title deeds for recovered public land worth Sh5.2 billion. EACC CEO Twalib Mbarak said on Saturday that this brings the cumulative value of the recovered assets to over 30 billion, from 2013. It also said that it is currently pursuing 357 civil cases in various courts across the country to recover public assets valued at Sh14 billion, and unexplained wealth worth Sh7.6 billion. Twalib added that the recoveries made so far include: 53.4 acres of prime land in Industrial Area Nairobi worth Sh5 billion belonging to the Meteorological Department, 2,312 acres in Naivasha worth Sh2 billion belonging to the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO). "We have further recovered 72.2 acres of public land worth Sh2 billion belonging to the Kenya Railways Corporation in Kisumu, and three (3) parcels of prime land for the Kenya School of Government, Nairobi valued at Sh63,000,000," Twalib said. He said that the commission will continue to intensify the tracing, preservation and recovery of unexplained and corruptly acquired assets through civil proceedings and Alternative Dispute Resolution. "Asset recovery serves to not only take away the motivation for corrupt conduct but also to ensure that the corrupt do not benefit from their criminal actions," Twalib said.
