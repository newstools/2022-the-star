Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has refuted claims by a section of stakeholders that President Uhuru Kenyatta hasn't employed sufficient teachers in the country. Speaking on Wednesday during the 45th Kenya Secondary School heads meeting (KESSHA) in Mombasa, Magoha said credit should be given where it's due. "Let us give Caesar what belongs to him," Magoha said. "Do not accuse the President of not employing teachers. From when he took over he has employed over 120,000 teachers, and even this year he is employing." President Kenyatta officially opened the conference. The meeting was attended by over 10,000 secondary school principals from across the country. In his address to the teachers, the President focused on the Competency Based Curriculum, CBC. He noted that the roll out of the curriculum is on course with more than Sh9 million already set aside for learners in January 2023. The head of state confirmed that 6,470 classrooms out of the 10,000 earmarked to accommodate Junior Secondary school learners in January 2023 have been completed. He lauded the new curriculum as the best for the learners as it focuses on  identifying and nurturing their potential through practical learning as opposed to theoretical teaching which laid emphasis on routine memorization of content. In his speech, Magoha lauded the school heads as heroes who have carried the country through the transformation of the education system. "I have never heard you pronounce something during the day and then change at night. That is why you are the ministers of Education. I am just your agent. I appreciate that," Magoha said. He said he was committed to ensuring that the Elimu scholarship goes to learners from poor backgrounds. The programme will benefit 9,000 learners who cleared their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education in March this year.
