The medical charity, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), says three people have been killed inside a hospital in the Kreneik area of the Sudanese region of Darfur. The hospital's pharmacy was also looted, it said in a statement. The victims included two medical workers. MSF teams were not present at the facility at the time of the attack, the charity added. The MSF said a second raid was staged at El Geneina Teaching Hospital, in West Darfur’s capital city, with shooting taking place inside the facility, including the emergency room. One hospital staff was killed, and health workers, including those from MSF, were evacuated. "We are shocked by these attacks and send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed. We condemn these deadly intrusions in the strongest possible terms," the statement said. The United Nations has called for an investigation into clashes in recent days between rival communities which reportedly left more than 160 people dead.
