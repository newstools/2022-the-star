Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura has rejected the UDA nomination results for Ruiru parliamentary seat. Mwaura's competitor Simon Ng'ang'a has taken a lead in the UDA nominations, despite there being pending nominations in three stations of Mwiki Ward. Provisional results showed that Ng'ang'a garnered 4,688 votes followed by Mwaura who got 2,428. Speaking to his supporters on Friday morning, Mwaura said the exercise was unfair and demanded that it should be repeated. "Huu uchanguzi tunasema urudiwe [The election should be repeated]," he said. He added that the members will not allow a member who decamped from Jubilee to disrupt the voting exercise. "We have built this party, we know the pains," he added. He further urged Deputy President William Ruto to resolve the issue and direct a fresh nomination. He said that it was not fair for non-UDA members to have their names listed before the UDA members in the ballot papers. "Kabogo left UDA, why is his name appearing first on the ballot paper?" he posed. Mwaura's supporters have reiterated that the elections should be conducted afresh. "We should be allowed to vote for the aspirant we want," they said. Simon Waiharo, who is also competing for the ticket, reiterated that the process should be repeated with transparency. Ng'ang'a has lauded the residents for coming out to vote and showed confidence in his winning. "I thank Ruiru residents for coming out to vote for me. Although I've not been declared the winner due to the challenges that happened at Mwiki, I believe I will still make it in the end." Mwaura lost his parliamentary bid in the 2017 General elections to Ng'ang'a.
