An aspirant for Kilgoris Parliamentary seat has told United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party leadership to conduct the nominations instead of issuing direct tickets to an individual. Businessman Joel Tasur said the party should allow the people to decide on the party flag bearer so as to get the best candidate. The nomination was slated for April 14 where the party was conducting countrywide exercise, but the primaries for Kilgoris, and Narok South MP seats were postponed due to consensus among aspirants. The nomination for two constituencies were scheduled for April 19. “My supporters have been wondering, and calling me to know why the nominations did not take place on the day it was supposed but due to talks it was postponed, something which they have persistently opposed. I have been advocating for a free and fair nominations process so that the people can get a chance to exercise their democratic rights through the polls process,” Tasur said. He spoke to the Star on the phone on Monday. The  aspirant is scheduled to face former Rift-Valley Regional director of education John Ololtuaa. Tasur said that he met with the panel handling consensus issues on Sunday, and told them that the nomination process will be better in settling the issue. “My opponent is rooting for consensus saying that he has huge followers, something which I disagreed with for the fairness of the locals. We should be subjected to the nomination process." Efforts to get comments from Ololtuaa on the claims were not successful as the phone  calls went unanswered. The aspirant pointed accusing fingers to some few party officials saying they stop involving themselves in handpicking candidates, something he said might affect the popularity of the party. “We need to leave the people to decide their own political destiny, not impose leaders on the people. We should learn from the recent primaries where the power of the people was witnessed across the country,” said Tasur.
