Tharaka Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki has scoffed at Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kanu leader Gideon Moi over their campaigns in the county. He said the two are unproductive leaders who can’t help the people of Tharaka Nithi, notwithstanding their position in the next government. The governor spoke on Saturday while distributing planting seeds at Kibung’a, Tharaka Nithi. Njuki said Kalonzo joined Azimio la Umoja coalition due to pressure and signed documents that he (Kalonzo) attested to knowing nothing about. "Why come and lie to residents?" He also said Agriculture CS Peter Munya is an enemy of Tharaka people. “Just draw a picture where Munya and Raila Odinga are planning anything good for Tharaka people," Njuki said. The county boss said Raila has never visited the region. “How does he know the challenges our people go through daily?" He said electing Raila means tough times ahead, which are detrimental to the growth of the economy. Njuki said Deputy President William Ruto on the other hand has visited Tharaka Nithi a number of times. He said President Uhuru Kenyatta should honour his promise and support Ruto for presidency. "In 2017, we came here with Uhuru and his deputy. Ruto was promised 10 years after the end of Uhuru's two terms. I urge residents to pray for Uhuru, he may have been bewitched," the governor said. He however said since his allegiance to Ruto, he has been receiving threats and intimidations by state organs. “I am aware of informers planted to check on me daily. I am not afraid of them. No one can intimidate me. I will not leave UDA,” Njuki said. He however said those in Jubilee should not fear to campaign for Raila in Tharaka Nithi or Meru, but never should they allow Kalonzo and Gideon to abuse him (Njuki). (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
