The National government through the ministry of Agriculture has been requested to urgently convene a national sugar conference to address the issues affecting the sector. Felix Minda, a Director at the Kenya National Chambers of Commerce and Industry noted that it has taken almost 18 years since the last conference was convened. He said the conference will enable stakeholders in the industry converge and give direction on the management of the sector. “I want to appeal to the next Parliament to prioritize the sugar industry because if affects other sectors," Minda said. He noted that currently, the economy of sugarcane growing zones is doing badly as some businesses have collapsed as a result of the mismanagement of the sugar industry. According to Minda, the sugar sector sustains close to 7.2 million livelihoods and its continued decline is unfortunate. “Right now we have approximately 420,000 metric tones deficit of sugar in the local market as a result of poor management of the sector.” Minda further pointed out that cane development was currently too expensive for most farmers to afford. The KNCC Director noted that for years now, the sugar sector has continued to dwindle affecting farmers' livelihoods year in year out but nothing is being done. “I have been in this industry as a champion of the sugarcane growers for close to 36 years now and there has not been any change,” Minda told the media.
