Nairobi County Speaker Benson Mutura has been summoned to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) offices over alleged theft. He is expected to appear at their offices at 2 pm to shed light on theft allegations. "I am conducting investigation into an alleged ...stealing by servant. I have reasons to believe that you, Benson Mutura is connected to the offence or has information that may assist in the investigations," the summons read in part. Speaking to journalists in his office on Wednesday, Mutura said the police had attempted to arrest him in his offices in the morning. He termed the attempted arrest as a  witch-hunt because he had declared that he will support Deputy President William Ruto's bid. "This morning while I was in the office, some officer came to arrest me without a summon and reason. What they did was in total contravention of the Nairobi County standing orders," he said. He said he was immediately uncuffed after he protested the move by the officers. "I am ready to obey the summons. I have been diligent in what I have been doing," he said. Earlier this month, Speaker Mutura officially joined United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party. Mutura said he is not vying for any political seat but will work for the party. “I’m not contesting for any political seat. I will perform tasks and duties assigned by the  UDA party,” he said. Mutura is not a new face in Nairobi politics. He first served as the Kimathi Ward councillor before he was elected Makadara MP in the 2013 General Elections on a TNA party ticket. He however lost the seat to ODM's George Aladwa in the 2017 polls. He made a comeback in city leadership on August 14, 2020, after he was elected the third speaker of the county assembly. This was after Beatrice Elachi resigned from the position after protracted wrangles with MCAs. Mutura was fronted by President Uhuru Kenyatta for the Speaker's seat.
