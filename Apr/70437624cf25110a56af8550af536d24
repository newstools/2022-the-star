Road users have been urged to strive to be responsible while plying various routes in the country. Drivers, riders and pedestrians have been urged to comply with traffic rules and also take up the role of educating others on safety behaviours. In a road safety campaign on Tuesday, the Authority said the campaign is designed to highlight six risky behaviours and equip road users with information and knowledge on how to prevent fatal crashes and injuries. The campaign is themed #FatalSix. "The Easter season is one of the busiest periods, there is increased travel across the country and all efforts are aimed at ensuring all road users reach their destinations safely," NTSA said in a statement. According to NTSA, road crash data points to human-related behaviour as the major cause of fatal crashes. NTSA in this year’s Easter Campaign has flagged speeding, lane indiscipline, drunk driving, distracted driving, failure to wear a helmet and failure to use available pedestrian walkways as the Fatal Six behaviours likely to lead to deadly road accidents. The authority notes that users who engage in one of these behaviours are far more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than those who do not. "Crashes affect families, the community at large and all stakeholders must do everything it takes to stop the unnecessary loss of lives," the NTSA statement reads. "To enhance the dissemination of the information on the Fatal Six Campaign, NTSA will be collaborating with all Ministries, Departments and Agencies through the road safety mainstreaming initiative so as to reach a wide audience and realize behaviour change among road users." During this period, the Authority urges motorists to plan their journeys to avoid the last-minute rush, share the road, be patient and be cognizant of other road users.
