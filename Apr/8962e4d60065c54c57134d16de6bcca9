Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni arrived in Kenya on Friday ahead of the signing ceremony to admit Democratic Republic of Congo to the East Africa Community. Museveni who was accompanied by Ugandan officials was received at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by  Foreign Affairs CS Raychelle Omamo. The president of DRC Felix Tshisekedi arrived on Thursday evening for the ceremony. Tshisekedi was accompanied by the First Lady of DRC Denise Nyakéru Tshisekedi. The presidents are expected to head to State House where the ceremony will be held by host President Uhuru Kenyatta. Uhuru is the Chair of the EAC Summit of Heads of State. The EAC common market consists of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. EAC was set up in 2010 to allow free movement of goods and people across borders, and is one of the most advanced trading blocs on the continent. Uhuru has been leading the charge for DRC to join the regional bloc ever since the inauguration of President Felix Tshisekedi in 2018 as part of Nairobi’s strategy to expand its market. While Tshisekedi launched his presidential bid in Nairobi in November 2018, Uhuru was the only African head of state who attended his inauguration in Congo. During the visit, Uhuru proposed DRC’s admission to the EAC. President Uhuru Kenyatta said DRC's admission as a full member will boost the common market's annual economic output by a quarter.
