Fuel distributor, Rubis, has dismissed a widely circulated statement criticising some Kenyan politicians for associating it with the First family. The statement alleged that some politicians had blamed Rubis for the current fuel crisis in the country. “We wish to notify the public that the below statement being circulated online is FAKE. We urge you to be cautious of any information shared and received that is not from our official social media handles," Rubis said in a statement on Twitter. It said all its communication are through its official social media handle  @RubisEnergyKenya and its official websiteRubiskenya.com. The fake statement had distanced the company from the Kenyatta family and blamed a business competitor it did not name of witch-hunt. It also alleged that the company should be lauded for its strategic decision not to hoard fuel. The fake statement further claimed Rubis had directed its lawyers to investigate the possibility of pursuing defamation suits against the individuals behind the claims. The fact-checker has verified that the statement did not originate from Rubis. The contents of the statement do not also match with press statements issued earlier by the company. Rubis asked members of the public to ignore the false statement. Rubis, founded in 1990, is an independent French operator specialising in three business areas. The company is now a major player in the fuels distribution business in Kenya. In March 2019, the company acquired the assets owned and operated by KenolKobil PLC, and later Gulf Energy Holdings in November 2019. The acquisitions meant that Rubis became a formidable competitor in the gas business in the region.
