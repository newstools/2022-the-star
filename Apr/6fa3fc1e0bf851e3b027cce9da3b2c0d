Athletes and officials have decried the lack of training facilities in Kisii, Nyamira, and Migori counties. Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza South chairman, Peter Angwenyi, athletes Dominic Ndigiti and Sammy Nyokaye petitioned the respective county governments to complete works at Gusii, Migori, and Manga stadia. Angwenyi noted with concern that Kisii and Nyamira counties which have produced Olympic gold medalists lack basic running tracks and other facilities. They said Kisii University grounds, the only venue at the moment, is equally in a bad shape. In a recent interview, Kisii Governor James Ongwae promised to have the stadium ready in two months’ time. However, the contractor is yet to start planting grass while the tartan track has not been installed. During the Nyanza South track and field championships at Kisii University on Monday, several events including steeplechase and hurdles didn't take place due to a lack of facilities and field implements. “For us to restore our lost glory, the county governments should complete the facilities and equip them fully,” said Angwenyi. “There is no proper track in Nyamira and when it rains, I’m unable to train and prepare for various events. Most athletes train in primary and secondary school grounds which are in a pathetic shape,” said Ndigiti. He further appealed to AK to train more specialist coaches at the grassroots level. “There are many walkers in Nyanza but they don’t have proper guidance and coaching because walking is a more technical discipline,” noted Ndigiti. Nyokaye petitioned the county to construct stadiums with standard running tracks in every sub-county. AK public relations officer, Evans Bosire, said the three youth camps at Kiendege, Boruma, and Keberesi will help unearth talent. “As AK, we are determined to develop talent. That is why we have set up the camps across the country to prepare athletes ahead of the World Under 20 championships,” said Bosire.
