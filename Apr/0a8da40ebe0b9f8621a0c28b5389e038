Embu Democratic Party members have urged Deputy President William Ruto to consider Justin Muturi, their party leader, for the running mate position. The members said having held major positions, Muturi is best experienced to serve as the coalition's running mate. Mbeere South Democratic party leader Charles Ireri said that was their request to the Kenya Kwanza coalition. The members spoke in Embu town at the party meeting. Speaker Justin Muturi was among the Kenya Kwanza principles who signed a coalition in the company of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula and UMP's Martin Wambora among others. Muturi has been the Speaker of the National Assembly for 10 years. The members feel this will catalyse his appointment. Democratic Party Senator aspirant Alexander Mundigi said Muturi has a clean political record and should be appointed as running mate to continue with effective leadership. “In the different positions he has held, Muturi performed his duties effectively without impartiality,” Mundigi said. The members said they support the party's move to join the Kenya Kwanza coalition against a few, whom they said wrote a letter to the registrar of political parties claiming Muturi acted against the party laws. Mundigi said Muturi consulted the party members and aspirants. He said those claiming he acted against the party directives are led by personal interests. “We confirm that Muturi signed the coalition agreement in the presence of the party secretary general Jacob Haji, Patron Joseph Munyau, chairman Esau Kioni and members,”  Mundigi said. He said the members support Muturi's move and they have mandated him to partake in any negotiations on their behalf.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
