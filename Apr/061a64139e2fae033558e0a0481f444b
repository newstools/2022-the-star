Former envoy Julius Bitok has UDA nomination results for the Uasin Gishu governor seat and petitioned the party's elections board to order a repeat of the exercise. Politician Jonathan Bii was announced the winner with more than 71,000 votes while Bitok came second with about 51, 000 votes. Bitok said he had evidence that the tallying of votes was tampered with saying he won in five of the six constituencies but figures were altered. "We have credible evidence which we have given the party and we demand that the primaries be repeated as soon as possible," Bitok said. He further alleged that he was attacked by his rival and wants him disqualified from the race on the basis of instigating violence. According to Bitok, ballot papers for some polling stations were burnt by goons but the party ignored the incident and went on with the exercise. He said the use of violence and voter bribery were also wide spread during the exercise. The former Kenyan envoy to Pakistan questioned how in some parts of Uasin Gishu, the voter turn out was more than 80 per cent while the overall turnout was generally less than 10 per cent. More than five MP aspirants in Turbo constituency also rejected results for the primaries in the constituency. They claimed that the results were were altered leading to chaotic tallying. On Friday, lawyer Kipchumba Karoli also rejected preliminary results which gave Governor Jackson Mandago ahead in the race for the UDA Senate ticket in Uasin Gishu.
