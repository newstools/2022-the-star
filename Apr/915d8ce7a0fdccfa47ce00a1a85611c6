Candidates who sat the 2021 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exam can access their results through the Kenya National Examination Council (KNEC) website, SMS platforms, county education offices and their respective schools. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said the parents, guardians and the students should send their index number, followed by the initials KCSE (in capital letters) to 20076 in order to access the results. The SMS platform is available for all mobile networks and will be charged Sh25 each. Students are also advised not to have spacing between the index number and the initials KCSE. He said the candidates should also collect their results from their respective examination centres. The candidates have the option of checking the results via the KNEC portal. They were advised to head to the KCSE tab and select the year they sat the national exams and enter their Index number. Due to the urgency and high demand for the results, the Ministry of Education advises that the platform may experience delays and asked the students to be patient. Some 831,015 candidates sat the exam in 10,413 centres compared to 752,981 in 10,437 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 78,034 or 9.39 per cent.
