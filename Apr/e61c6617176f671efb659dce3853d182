Kenyan artists have expressed disappointment after receiving Sh1,215.95 from the Performers Rights Society of Kenya. On Tuesday, a few of them shared on social media the amount they had received from Prisk. Rapper Wangeci said being an artist in Kenya is an extreme sport. She shared a screenshot of an M-Pesa message she received from the organisation. Singer Nikita Kering also posted her disappointment. Rapper KRG The Don posted a sarcastic message. "Nani anataka loan coz zile pesa tulikua tunangoja zimefika!!! Our President we are so proud of you!!" Gabu said artists want to see change, not pocket change. Prisk is mandated to clear rights on behalf of performers who include actors, musicians and studio producers.
