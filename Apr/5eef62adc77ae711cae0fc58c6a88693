Kitui governor aspirant David Musila has pledged to introduce a Sh800 million ward development kitty if elected. Musila said through the annual fund, the 40 wards in Kitui will be allocated Sh20 million for equitable and localised development programmes. The aspirant said he will economically empower jobless youths in Kitui. He said youth empowerment will be an integral part of his administration. Musila said they will benefit from the 30 per cent contracts as stipulated by the law. He said though the youths, women and persons with disabilities are meant to benefit from the 30 per cent governemnt contracts, they have been ignored. The aspirant spoke on Sunday at Kaliku in Kitui East. Musila said he will set up a county youth service for skills development. “This will impart technical and vocational skills to youth including those who fail to perform well academically,” he said. “Upon completion of their training, the youths would be placed on a three month fully paid internship before they start looking for jobs elsewhere.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
