Tension engulfed the Kenya Kwanza meeting on Sunday at Sondu Primary school in Kisumu County after police disrupted a meeting by DP William Ruto's allies. The team was led by gubernatorial aspirant Walter Nyambati, North Mugirango MP Joash Nyamoko, West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi, Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose and other aspirants. Other leaders who were in attendance include woman representative aspirants; Josephine Omanwa, and Alice Chae, senatorial aspirants Nyambega Mose, West Mugirango MP aspirant Charles Ongoto among other Mca aspirants from UDA. Ruto's allies had met supporters from North Mugirango Constituency for a consultative meeting that police termed illegal before they interrupted and disrupted it. The meeting had almost come to an end before police officers in anti-riot gear from Sondu police station arrived causing tension among the attendees. The leaders referred to the police action as intimidation and urged the security officers not to be used to stop them from campaigning. "We have a right to be anywhere and at anytime in the Republic of Kenya. We do not want a situation whereby police officers are being used to intimidate Kenyans who have freedom of holding meetings in their own country, " Kitutu Masaba MP Shadrack Mose said. The leaders said the action is a form of intimidation to supporters of DP Ruto and called for a speedy investigation into the matter. "We cannot be intimidated, we are here lawfully and police should cease such coward actions, this is our country and we have every right to be anywhere," said West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi. The leaders insisted on holding meetings despite intimidation from government organs saying a section of leaders are fearing defeat and hence want to use such action against their leader DP Ruto and his allies.
