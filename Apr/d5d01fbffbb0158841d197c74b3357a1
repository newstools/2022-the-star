Squatters in Lamu county want the National Land Commission to conduct fresh audits of all ranches to resettle them. In 2015, the national government revoked ownership of 350,000 acres of land, mostly ranches in Lamu after it was established that they were irregularly acquired and were handed to the county for administration. The squatters also want the NLC to come clean on the fate of the revoked lands. “We know lands were revoked, other than that we only hear rumours that they were re-possessed secretly by the owners. If this is true, we want to know the position of the NLC on this matter,” Shifu said. The plan was to resettle squatters on the lands but it is suspected that the revoked lands have been secretly handed back to their owners. The squatters are now demanding a fresh audit to enable their resettlement. Areas with the highest squatter population in Lamu include Hindi, Mkunumbi, Koreni, Mapenya, Mpeketoni, Kibaoni and Witu. The squatters spokesperson Mohamed Shifu said many of the so-called ranches are large tracts of land lying idle for decades. They are accusing ranch owners of irregularly acquiring large tracts of land, hence compounding their woes. Land remains a thorny issue in Lamu with most of it still classified as public, making it easy for land grabbers to thrive. “If an audit is conducted, the truth about ownership will be revealed and  squatters will be resettled. Lamu should not have squatters because there is a lot of  idle land but corruption has denied us an opportunity to be land owners," Shifu said. They said most ranch owners have a habit of grabbing any land bordering theirs. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
