The police in Gigiri Sub-County, Nairobi have arrested a 37 year old woman found in possession of the pistol. They said in a statement on Saturday that the arrest followed a report made by a driver operating a cab with one of the ride-hailing companies in Kenya. According to the report, Stella Waithera Kahigi hailed a cab from Freetown Loresho to her residence in Kangemi at around 0300 hours. On arrival at her residence, a disagreement arose over payment for the ride. Stella entered into her house and came out armed with a pistol threatening to shoot the cab driver. The police said that the driver retreated and proceeded to Spring Valley police station and booked the incident. Officers rushed to the residence-turned-crime scene and recovered a Daisy revolver from the suspect. She will be arraigned to face several criminal charges. We commend the cab driver for the prompt action he took that led to the recovery and arrest. Even as we strive to keep our streets safe, we also wish to advice members of the public to be wary of their personal safety as they go about their businesses.
