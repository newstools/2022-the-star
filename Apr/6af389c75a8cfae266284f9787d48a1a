Instagram’s Chief Adam Mosseri on Thursday announced that Instagram will be making an update to the way it ranks content. “Creators are so important to the future of Instagram, and we want to make sure that they are successful and get all the credit they deserve,” Mosseri said. The new updates will be made up of three changes: Instagram has made product tags, Enhanced tags and ranking for originality. Product tags will now be available to everyone, so you can now tag a product in your post and assign yourself a category. “We want to do more and value original content more," he said. Enhanced tags were launched earlier this month to allow users to share and view creators' specific contribution to a post. Enhanced tags will tend to group and give the designated profile category within that tag. For example: makeup artist, photographer, rapper, painter, videographer, etc. “As we lean more into recommendations, it’s becoming increasingly important that we don’t overvalue aggregators,” he said. In terms of original content, Instagram says it wants to focus more on creators with original content. What this means is that content with visible watermarks will still be penalized under the new policy, in Instagram Reels at least. Mosseri admits that Instagram cannot know for sure if the content is original or not but he says they will build classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. “If you create something from scratch, you should get more credit, than if you are re-sharing from someone else,” he said. In simple terms, a creator who shares or re-shares videos with logos or from other sites, they won't appear on the explore page. Your only reach will be severely limited with your followers in their feeds, and you are most likely going to be labelled as a low-quality account.
