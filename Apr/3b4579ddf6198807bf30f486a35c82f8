Al-Amin Mohamed,14, who made history by becoming the first ever to score 403 in Lamu East subcounty at Kizingitini Primary School said he was shocked to have been selected to join St Josephs Boys High school, Kitale. The disappointed boy hoped to join Alliance Boys high school in Kiambu county. “I am so disappointed because that wasn’t my choice at all. I hope they can do something because I don’t see myself joining that school,” Mohamed said. His mother, Muhsina Vae, said she was disappointed by the placement. “I want to apply for a transfer so that my son can go to Alliance. There is no other way around it for me,” Vae said. Top Lamu girl Ashraf Ali Mohamed who scored 411 marks has been placed at Moi Girls Isinya High School in Kajiado county. Her wish however was to join Alliance Girls High School. A few of the 2021 KCPE candidates were lucky to be selected to their schools of choice.
