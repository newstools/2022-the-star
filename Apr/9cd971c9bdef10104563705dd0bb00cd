The United Democratic Alliance has told aspirants in Rift Valley to expect nothing but free, fair and verifiable nominations. The primaries are set for tomorrow and most of Deputy President William Ruto allies will face off for the UDA ticket. UDA regional coordinator Paul Kiprop and patron Joseph Wainaina on Tuesday, said all was set for the primaries and they will show Kenyans their democratic strength. “We are not building a village party but a national one, where the voice of every member will be heard and respected. Winners and losers will work together to strengthen UDA after primaries," Wainaina said. He said the party values peace and unity and urged aspirants and their supporters not to engage in acts that would undermine peace. “We are very strict on peace and no one will be allowed to cause any form of chaos during the primaries," Wainaina said. Kiprop said they had received ballot papers and other materials for the primaries and that the same had been distributed to polling centres. He said the UDA primaries will use the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission voter register in all regions. “We expect a very high turnout especially in Rift Valley because the UDA primaries in this region are almost like the general election. Winners will most likely win come August 9," Kiprop said. Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi said the party believes in participatory democracy and that is why all aspirants will be subjected to the primaries. Aspirants for various seats in Uasin Gishu, Nandi, Trans Nzoia and Elgeyo Marakwet said they were satisfied with the measures put in place to ensure free and fair nominations. “We believe the primaries will be free and fair and we must all work towards the success of the exercise and peace,” Soy MP Caleb Kositany said. UDA has trained hundreds of officials who will preside over the nominations in all counties. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
