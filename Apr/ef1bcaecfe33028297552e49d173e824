Safaricom, the largest Telco in the country, has finally rolled out online registration of SIM cards ahead of Friday, April 15, 2022 deadline by Communications Authority. This is after an uproar from Kenyans on social media, who told the company to follow in the footsteps of Telkom who had rolled out the online Sim Card registration. The Communications Authority of Kenya announced that all active SIM cards should be registered by Friday, asserting that the process is a normal occurrence in the country. In recent days, long queues were witnessed in a number of registration centres across the country ahead of the deadline. Unregistered Sim cards in Kenya will be deactivated as the government steps up the fight against crime and improve data accuracy. This is the third time in a decade the regulator is coming up with a deadline to switch off the SIM cards after a similar attempt in 2012 and 2018. According to the authority, mobile operators and subscribers have had enough time to conduct the cleanup exercise as per their request in 2018.
