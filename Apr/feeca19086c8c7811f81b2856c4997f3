Nothing captures the pain of political party aspirants better than the video of a mother of a parliamentary aspirant from Kisumu county that has gone viral. The woman cries uncontrollably while tightly holding her son. Why? Her son's competitor has been handed a direct ticket bringing to a screeching halt her son's budding political career. The manner in which political parties have treated their members and aspirants is unacceptable. In some instances outright illegal. It clearly shows disdain for the voter and robs Kenyans of the opportunity to choose. In some instances where voters went to the ballot, tickets were issued to losing candidates associated with party leaders. Take for instance the zoning of Nairobi county by Azimio affiliate parties. Aspirants who had been campaigning for months had their dreams shattered. While the move could be a strategy to win more seats, it could be done in a better way to save the aspirants time and resources. The story of Westlands is sad. When Tim Wanyonyi was told to go back and defend his Westlands parliamentary seat, the ODM nominations in the constituency were underway. The party then sent out a callous statement that the exercise had been stopped. How are the aspirants, who have spent their resources, supposed to react? Political parties are public institutions, funded by the exchequer. They must respect the people and promote democracy. Otherwise, why should taxpayers bear the burden of individual-run enterprises?
