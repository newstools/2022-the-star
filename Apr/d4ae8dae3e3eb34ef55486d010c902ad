Olympian Jacob Krop is keen to retain his title when he competes at the  Adzero Road To Records 5km race in Germany this weekend. The West Pokot County runner won last year’s event, timing 13:06, the third-fastest time over this distance in history. Krop was speaking at the Chewoyet Secondary School when Athletics Kenya youth development committee visited the World U20 training camp last week. And even though he is currently ineligible, the Africa Youth 5,000m silver medalist said wants to inspire the youngsters. “I have been training well ahead of this race. I even had to miss the national championships-cum-national trials to the Africa Senior Athletics Championships currently taking place at Moi Stadium, Kasarani,” the 21-year-old said. “The challenge in Germany will be tough but I am ready for it.” “I always find time to visit the Under-20 camp at Chewoyet to motivate the juniors to go through the same route I used to succeed,” he said. “This region is full and deep in cultural beliefs and cattle rustling, but I had to choose a different route,” said Krop, who was part of Team Kenya at both the Tokyo Olympic Games last year and the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. He said he is always eager to share ideas with upcoming runners, especially from the region. "I always enjoy being with these junior runners and I can see we have great talent here. I join them to give them hope and tell them that sports pay as long as you work hard and remain disciplined," said Krop.
