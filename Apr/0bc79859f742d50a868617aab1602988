A suspect in the probe into the killing of six family members in Kandara, Murang’a county, will be detained for 21 days. The detention is to allow the police complete to their investigations. Alice Mugikuyu Njoroge was presented before a Kandara court before principal magistrate Eric Mutunga where police successfully asked for more time to hold her to complete their probe into arson. The six who were killed are Mary Wambui (60 years), Cecilia Gathoni (30), Lucy Mumbi (18), Margaret Wanja (15), Jackline Wambui (7) and Alvin Kiarie (3). She was arrested Sunday after her family members were killed in a fire incident in the village. She will be held at Muthaiga police cells or any other station as the officers from the homicide department continue with the probe. The motive of the incident is yet to be revealed but police suspect land dispute. Preliminary findings show the tragic occurrence could have been caused by a missing phone. Murang’a county police commander Ali Nuno said they had established a dispute over a missing phone could have led to the incident. The ill-fated house, where the six were burned to death, had been bolted from the outside. The prime suspect, who is said to have been living in the same house at the time of the incident, reportedly moved her belongings prior to the incident. The father of the home Joseph Kungu had died years ago. Neighbours said they heard screams coming from the house at around 1:30 am and rushed to the scene and found smoke billowing from the house while the door had been locked from outside. Efforts to rescue them were futile as the flames became fierce and overwhelmed them. An angry mob threatened to lynch the prime suspect but she was whisked to safety by police officers who had arrived at the scene.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
