Kiss FM presenters Kamene and Obinna will be giving out free items. The two will give out 10 outfits and 10 pairs of shoes each. Speaking to word Is, Obinna said, "Kamene is afraid of giving out clothes she has already used. I was telling her we need to give out some of our clothes and shoes." "If you guys want some clothes, just pass by, holla," Kamene said. Kamene added that Obinna doesn't rewear clothes. "Another thing about him, he wears three outfits in a day. One for the show, another one for the gym and one for his shoots." She described Obinna's style as 'Never get it wrong'. "He is very accurate and plans what to wear for a whole week. He does not repeat clothes."
