If you like your iced coffee strong, with just a hint of cream and sugar, then you will definitely love a Popsicle version of it. With only three ingredients, your Popsicle will be ready in no time. Note; you will require a Popsicle mold for this recipe Ingredients Preparation Step 1 To sweeten the cream take 1/3 cup of cream and sweeten it with a little sugar then stir until completely dissolved. Step 2 Pour a little of the cream into the bottom of each mold, just about 1/4 to 1/2 inch high. Then freeze the mold for 1 hour or until the cream is solid. Step 3 Mix the coffee, more cream and sugar in a glass then stir until the sugar is dissolved. Step 4 Carefully pour the chilled coffee mixture into each of the frozen molds, filling it to the top. Step 5 Cover the top with foil, for the sticks to remain in place before inserting the sticks. Freeze until solid. Tip To un-mold the popsicles, fill your sink with hot water, and submerge the mold in the water right up to, but not past, the top ledge for about 15-30 seconds. If the popsicles don’t slide out, submerge it for a few seconds longer. Enjoy with friends and family
