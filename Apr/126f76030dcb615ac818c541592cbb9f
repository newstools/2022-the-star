Uefa have ordered the partial closure of Atletico Madrid’s Wanda Metropolitano Stadium for their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Manchester City on Wednesday over the “discriminatory behaviour” of their supporters. Kevin De Bruyne’s 70th-minute goal earned City a 1-0 win at home in the first leg last Tuesday, after which the Spanish side were charged, with the offences of their fans including throwing of objects. The Appeals Body of European football governing body said it had ordered a partial closure of Atletico’s stadium in the next Uefa competition match they host. “Club Atletico de Madrid shall inform prior to the match, the sector(s) to be closed, which shall at least comprehend 5,000 seats,” Uefa said in a statement. It also ordered Atletico to display a banner with the wording “#NoToRacism” and the Uefa logo on it. Meanwhile, Uefa have provisionally suspended Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt’s manager Kjetil Knutsen and Italian club AS Roma’s goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos following their ill-tempered Europa Conference League match in Norway last week. After last Thursday’s 2-1 quarter-final first-leg defeat, the Italian side’s captain Lorenzo Pellegrini said Santos had been attacked, while Knutsen accused a Roma goalkeeping coach of grabbing him by the throat. Read full story Bodo said last Friday that they planned to report the incident to the police. Uefa said in a statement that Knutsen and Santos would be suspended for the next Uefa club competition matches in which they would otherwise participate until its Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body decides on the merits of the case. European soccer’s governing body said last week that it had appointed an ethics and disciplinary inspector to conduct a disciplinary investigation into the incidents.
