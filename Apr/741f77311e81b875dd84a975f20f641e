Air frying has become common in Kenya, probably because compared to deep frying or baking, it uses less oil. Some studies suggest air frying cuts calories by 70% to 80% and has a lot less fat. Gone are the days you only had the option of having fried chips or wedges. Let's make some garlic potatoes Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Peel the potatoes and cut them into almost the same size to ensure they cook evenly, then rinse over cold water. Step 2 Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees to ensure accurate cooking temperature. Step 3 Coat your potatoes with some butter, salt, garlic powder black pepper, and olive oil. Step 4 Toss the potatoes in your air fryer. Ensure it is not overcrowded so that it cooks evenly. You can cook in batches of 2 or 3. Step 5 Cook for 10-25 minutes depending on your air fryer, tossing every 10 minutes if your air fryer does not do that for you. Step 6 Serve with a squeeze of lemon juice and enjoy!
