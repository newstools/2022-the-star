Kenya's gold medalists in the recent CANA Zone 4 Championships will feature in the Africa Junior Championship in Egypt in August. Interim Management Committee head of secretariat, Kenneth Karani said they are keen to expose the swimmers to continental events as part of the swimmers' development. "We will give a chance to our gold medallists to compete against the best in the continent during the Africa event in August,” said Karani. He said pre-selection for the team has already started as IMC seeks to give the swimmers time to prepare for the continental event. "The selection and planning process has started and we hope to notify swimmers once they are back from the break following the Zambia event,” said Karani Karani said despite sending 15 swimmers to the four-day championship,  the talent in the country is immense. "We were able to win 24 medals with 15 swimmers. So just imagine how many medals we would have won if we had sent a full team of 48 swimmers,” noted Karani. The gold medallists in the CANA Zone 4 Championship in Lusaka, Zambia included Mombasa-based Maria Bianchi, Imara Bella Thorpe, Macrine Kalombo, Neo Olengo and Angel Williams. Kenya finished seventh in the championship with 24 medals nine gold, seven silver, and eight bronze medals. Karani thanked the government for their support and hopes the same treatment will be extended to subsequent championships. He called on the authorities concerned to hold the delayed Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) elections to give the sport stability and fresh leadership.
