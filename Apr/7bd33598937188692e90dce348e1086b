After their fall out in Jubilee, some political leaders from Mt Kenya went on to form their own parties. They include Mwangi wa Iria (Usawa kwa Wote), Moses Kuria (Chama Cha Kazi), Mwangi Kiunjuri (The Service Party) and William Kabogo (Tujibebe Wakenya). The leaders were dismissive of Jubilee labeling it a shell and Uhuru as a lame-duck president who would have zero impact on succession politics. But Jubilee's comeback has caused panic among the parties by attracting aspirants and becoming  the formidable electoral machine it once was. The party is currently getting revamped by Uhuru's allies who are actively marketing its outlook. Over 5,300 aspirants have already applied for the Jubilee ticket for various positions.
