Huddah Monroe says she could never stay in a relationship with a man who lies to her. Huddah, through her Insta Stories, said she would rather be with a man who cheats but not a liar. She would quickly dump a man who is not honest, she said. "We are adults keep it 100! Especially black men lie for no reason at all," she said. She advised women with sons to raise them to be honest men. "I've dated too many nationalities and dating a black man is like going in a mase," she said. "It's too much hard work, you can easily go Mental." Huddah recounted how an ex made her never trust him even with sickness. "Once you lie once, it's hard for a woman/ man to trust you again," she said. "Once you lie to me once even if it's for a joke that's it. Everything you say is a lie! you might have to bring a whole cow to believe it's beef I'm eating! I just can't!"
