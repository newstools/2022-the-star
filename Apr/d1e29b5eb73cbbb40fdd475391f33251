Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League defending champions, Butali Warriors, climbed to the summit of the standings for the first time this season following their 2-1 win over Strathmore Gladiators at the City Park Stadium on Sunday. Captain Constant Wakhura gave the sugar millers an 11th-minute lead from a penalty corner before experienced midfielder Barnabas Odhiambo sealed the win two minute's later. Odhiambo, the former Nakuru coach scored his first goal of the season in the 13th minute. Lormotun Noel managed a consolation for the students one minute from regulation time, sounding the board in the 59th minute. Butali lead the standings with 10 points from four matches with Gladiators a point behind them in second place. Butali's Festus Onyango (three) and Wakhura (two) are the team's top scorers. Shammah Ademba and Tristin Karis have managed a goal each. Elsewhere, Strathmore Scorpions stung Amira Sailors 2-0 to continue their fine start to the season. Captained by Jeriah Onsare, Scorpions had to wait until the last quarter to break the deadlock. Angela Khamala and Jane Okumu scored in the 47th and 54th minutes respectively. History-making Scorpions are yet to concede a goal in the league after four matches. The well-oiled Meshack Senge coached Strath are touted as serious title contenders if their imperious early season form is anything to go by. Senge however has previously downplayed their title chances claiming that the students are inexperienced and under transition. In the men's Super League, a 16-minute goal from Arnold Marango was all that Kenya College of Accountancy University KCA-U needed to defeat Kenyatta University. KCA have lost just once this season. Their defeat came against Sikh Union who are seeking a return to the top tier after being relegated in the 2019 season before a two-year coronavirus pandemic enforced league break.
