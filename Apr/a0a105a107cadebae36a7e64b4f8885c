Tandoori chicken is a special Indian chicken dish that is prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yogurt and spices. It is quite smoky from the grill due to the hot spices like paprika, and chilies but it is succulently juicy and flavorful due to the use of yogurt. It can be served with a salad of choice, naan bread, chapati, rice, or oven fries. Ingredients Garnish: Dhania and fresh lime Preparation Step 1 Using a small bowl, stir together yogurt, oil, and all of the dry spices to make a marinade. Step 2 Place the chicken in a bowl and rub the yogurt marinade over your chicken thighs. Cover and leave to marinate for a minimum of two hours or overnight in a fridge (optional) Step 3 Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Foil your baking pan and spread the marinated chicken. Step 4 Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until juices run clear and the internal temperature of the chicken is 165 degrees F. Step 5 Take chicken out of the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before enjoying it. Step 6 Sprinkle with dhania and fresh lime, and enjoy.
