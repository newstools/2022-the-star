Comedian Omosh says his biggest regret is why he started drinking alcohol. Omosh, who has always been open about his struggles with alcohol, told 'Glow up with Makena' that he has been drinking most of his life. "My biggest regret: Why did I drink? Why did I taste alcohol? Kwa nini nilitaste? But there came a time I saw that enough was enough. I have taken too much!" Omosh has since started going to church. He encouraged viewers to make a point of going to church or the mosque. In a past interview, Omosh said despite his passion for acting while a teenager in Nyeri county, he was already experimenting with alcohol due to peer pressure. "I grew up in a society where many people, including my relatives, consumed alcohol."
