The construction of a 4km Ruaka trunk sewer line through Karura Forest has commenced. Athi Water Works Development Agency says the project is part of the government’s Vision 2030,  aimed at ensuring improving sanitation. The agency said the project will also ensure adequate water supply in urban centres. “The sewer line collects and conveys upstream in areas of Ruaka and Runda effectively reducing water pollution in Ruaka River while ensuring access to clean water downstream,” the agency said. AWWDA said a project oversight team comprising Kenya Forest Service and Friends of Karura has been constituted to safeguard and ensure continued compliance. The agency said Ruaka and its environs have been experiencing high population growth and changes in land use patterns resulting to pollution of Ruaka River. “In order to optimise the total number of populations being served, the sewer networks have been contained along natural drainage areas to ensure it flows under gravity and avoid pumping which would be expensive,” the agency said. Due to the nature of gravity, Ruaka sewer trunk alignment was chosen to enable easy flow and protect the river from pollution. Karura Forest is located in the periphery of Nairobi City. At 2,572 acres, it is one of the largest gazetted urban forests in the world. The forest contains nearly all the 605 species of wildlife found in Nairobi including three types of antelope. It is managed by KFS. It is a 20-minute drive from the Nairobi CBD and can be accessed from two gates, one along Kiambu Road and the other along Limuru Road. Wangari Maathai fought against the grabbing of the forest, a move that won her many accolades. In 2004 she won the Nobel Peace Prize. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
