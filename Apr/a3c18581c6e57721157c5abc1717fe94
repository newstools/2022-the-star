An aspirant who endorsed Deputy President William Ruto's presidential candidature has cried foul over the party tickets in Taita Taveta county. Idris Mohamed, a youth leader and activist, seconded the DP’s bid during the party's delegates conference at Kasarani indoors arena. He is now protesting against what he termed as an attempt to deny him a UDA ticket to fight for Marungu MCA seat. Mohamed has written to the party, saying he has been denied a ticket despite mobilising support for the party in the region. It is alleged the ticket will be awarded to the incumbent MCA Waweru Kang'ethe. In a letter to the UDA National Elections Board and received by the party, Mohammed pleaded with the party to organise primaries in the ward, pointing out that he was the best suited to fly the ticket. “Through this [the primaries], it will build the party’s democracy,” the letter seen by the Star and dated April 18 reads in part. The activist further said he single-handedly recruited more than 1,500 members into UDA. He said he has been drumming support for Ruto’s presidency in the region through the Youth for Ruto Movement. During the Mahoo ward by-election where UDA's Daniel Kimuyu lost to Jubilee Party’s Donald Fundi, Mohammed was among the party’s lead campaigners alongside UDA chairman Johnson Muthama. “Being a UDA aspirant since December 2020, I feel neglected if the rumours in the locality claiming that the incumbent who joined UDA recently has been given a direct ticket is true,” he said.
