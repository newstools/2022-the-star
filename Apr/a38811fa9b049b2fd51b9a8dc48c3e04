Athletics Kenya has taken another big step in its air quality efforts with the unveiling of new sensors at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi. As part of World Athletics’ pilot programme to measure and analyse air quality at sporting venues around the world, and air quality monitor was installed at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani during last year’s World Athletics U20 Championships in Kenya. That installation was used primarily to assess the feasibility of maintaining high-end air quality devices in remote locations. In follow up, the partnership between Athletics Kenya, UNEP, and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) has now led to the further deployment of several sensors at the Nyayo and Kasarani stadia. These sensors will not only enable researchers to collect and analyse more data on the impact of air pollution on sports, but also inform mitigation actions. “I am proud that the two main stadiums in Kenya are now part of the World Athletics Air Quality project, which targets to improve the quality of environment and conditions of performances for the athletes, through data that has never been provided before,” said Athletics Kenya President Jackson Tuwei. “After the first test during our World Athletics U20 Championships, we are delighted to continue to work on this project. “Air pollution is a silent killer which is affecting the health of athletes, local communities, and our environment, so I’m delighted that the cooperation between the AK; Ministry of Sports, Ministry of Environment & Forestry; United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); Stockholm Environment Institute; our athletes and other partners has brought this project to fruition and I hope that together we can raise awareness and help to improve air quality not only in stadiums but around the country.”
