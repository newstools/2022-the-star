Six ward reps aligned to Mudavadi's ANC party have ditched the faction and joined Cyrus Jirongo's UDP under Azimio la Umoja. The MCAs cited frustrations in the party. They accused the top ANC officials of sponsoring opponents to fight them in their wards. They cited an event where ANC invited their rivals to the party's National Delegates Convention held in Nairobi leaving them behind. The MCAs are Victor Ijaika (Lugaga wa Muluma), Elisha Amara ( South Maragoli), Evans Chunguli (Central Maragoli), Gladys Analo ( Busali ward), Wycliffe Masini ( Mungoma ward) and Violet Bagada ANC nominated. “We have decamped to UDP for the sake of peace after frustrations from ANC top officials,” Ijaika said. Gladys Analo said they are ready to wrestle those aspirants being fronted by ANC to challenge them in their wards. “We will defeat and shame their sponsors,” Chunguli said. Ijaika said they are disappointed that in 2017 they stood with Mudavadi and saved him from shame after Moses Akaranga's PPK party won almost all seats in Sabatia. ANC won two seats Busali and West Sabatia wards. He said tampering with party nominations in 2017 cost the party many seats. “They want to repeat the same mistakes,” Ijaika said. The defectors were welcomed by Vihiga Senator George Khnairi who assured them of party tickets and full support. Khaniri who also decamped from ANC and joined UDP welcomed other aspirants from Emuhaya Luanda and Hamisi. He said UDP is the home party that is ready to accommodate everyone. Khaniri is contesting for Vihiga governor seat on the UDP ticket which he is hopeful of winning. “Let us join UDP which is our shield, to grow it to high levels. UDP will win many seats in Vihiga and give Jirongo high bargaining power in the Azimio government,” Khaniri said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
