All the seven UDA aspirants for the governor in Uasin Gishu held a joint meeting in Eldoret for the first time and agreed to foster peace and unity. The meeting comes ahead of party primaries on Thursday. They said the county is Deputy President William Ruto’s home and they wanted to avoid chaotic nominations. The aspirants also held joint prayers and a joint road show where they urged their supporters turn up in large numbers and vote for them. “We had a joint breakfast meeting where we agreed that the county is bigger than any of us and we agreed to engage in a healthy political competition," Soy MP Caleb Kositany said. Others aspirants present included Jonathan Bii, former envoys Julius Bitok and Sarah Serem, Ngenyilel MCA David Sing’oei, former Nairobi devolution executive Vesca Kangogo and  Solomon Kiptarbei. The meeting was also attended by Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, UDA patron in Uasin Gishu Joseph Wainaina and the party’s region coordinator Paul Kiprop. Kositany said party officials also explained to them how the nominations would be conducted and they were all satisfied. “We are seven but we know that only one of us will win on Thursday. We have agreed that whoever wins we will accept it as the choice of the people and will support him or her," Kositany said. Kangogo said each of them had given their best during the campaigns and now it is time for the people to decide. “We have told our supporters that we are united as aspirants and they should also keep peace because Uasin Gishu is our home and we have to remain united even after the nominations,” Kangogo said. Each aspirant expressed hope that he or she would emerge victorious during the primaries. Kiprop said the party was in the process of distributing all nomination materials to enable residents vote for their aspirants of choice. He said the exercise would be free and fair and that UDA would emerge stronger than it was after the primaries. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
