Education CS George Magoha has warned principals against asking parents to buy 'irrelevant' items. “As a ministry, we are committed to ensuring that parents and guardians with learners who will be joining Form 1 are not overburdened with unnecessary requirements,” Magoha said on Monday. He spoke at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, where he launched the Form 1 selection. The CS faulted school heads who request for extra items, saying this increases the cost of education. “Principals should exercise caution while listing student requirements as part of the measures to reduce the cost of education,” he said. Some items, he said, are usually provided by the government but some principals still ask for them. Some of the items to be avoided during Form 1 admissions are class readers, novels, photocopying papers, foolscaps, atlas and mathematical tables. “Others are exercise books, which are provided by the government, hockey sticks, pangas, jembes slashers and hand brushes,” he said. During last year’s Form 1 admission, parents decried being asked to buy extra items in specific outlets. On school fees, the CS said free secondary education initiative has helped solve the financial puzzle. Magoha said school heads should ensure funds are used efficiently and for the intended purpose. "This financial year alone, the government has released Sh62 billion under the Free Day Secondary Education," he said. The government also provides Sh22,244 to cover tuition and related expenses for all public secondary school students. The government provides capitation under FDSE for tuition, operations and infrastructure improvement. These funds are disbursed to schools based on enrollment. Some 1,214,031 candidates sat the 2021 KCPE exam and out of this number, 11,857 scored between 400 and 500 marks. Another 315,275 scored between 300 and 399 marks, while 578,197 scored between 200 and 299 marks. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
