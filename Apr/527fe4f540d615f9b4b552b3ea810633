Motorists intending to use the Nairobi Expressway will have to dig deeper into their pockets as the government revises toll rates up, by 16 per cent. This means that motorists will have to pay more to access the yet to be commissioned Nairobi Expressway. In a new gazette notice, the Ministry of Transport has lifted the toll rates by 16 per cent to reflect foreign exchange changes for the dollar-denominated charges, following the weakening of the Kenyan Shilling. The toll rates are set for future adjustments based on not just the prevailing exchange rate but also changes in the consumer price index (CPI). At the close of December 31, 2021, the shilling was valued at Sh113.14 in contrast to Sh103.79 on December  31, 2020, against the dollar. The Sh88 billion expressway has 11 interchanges at Mlolongo, Standard Gauge Railway, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass, Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Museum Hill, Westlands, and James Gichuru Road. The expressway, with 18.2km on the ground and 8.9km elevated, is a class A, four-lane dual carriageway with a design speed of 80km per hour. In the new rates, salon cars using the yet to be commissioned Nairobi Expressway from Mlolongo to the James Gichuru exit in Westlands will pay Sh360 from the initial Sh310. Here is the breakdown:         The Government had announced that it will conduct test runs in this month ahead of the commissioning of the expressway by President Uhuru Kenyatta. As of March, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport James Macharia had updated that the construction of the expressway stood at 95 per cent. The bulk of the work along the 27.1 km road, being the main infrastructure was said to be completed with the focus shifted to ancillary infrastructure. Moja Expressway, a subsidiary of China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), will operate the road for 27 years to recoup the money through toll fees. CRBC is responsible for designing, financing and building the expressway, and will maintain and operate it during the concession period. Several activities have also been prohibited on the expressway, including graffiti and scribbling on expressway property and setting up billboards without prior authorisation.
