Coach Peter Mwanthi is impressed with the progress of the national women's basketball deaf team ahead of the 24th Summer Deaflympics scheduled for May 1-15 in Caxias Do Sul, Brazil. He said he is happy that the team has made huge strides as far as ball-handling techniques are concerned. “The girls understand what is needed from them. We started with build-up fitness and they responded really well. Their ball handling technique is equally good although I never expected them to pick up that fast. When you have good ball-handling, then dealing with other technical things like movements is very easy,” said Mwanthi during the team’s training at Nyayo National Stadium. Mwanthi is banking on his vast experience at the international level to help guide Kenya to glory. Kenya are pitted against hosts Brazil,  Turkey, Argentina, and Denmark. The matches will be played on a round-robin format. While the team is inexperienced, Mwanthi is optimistic the knowledge he is sharing with them will come in handy during the three-week showpiece. “None of these girls have ever played an international match but as a  coach, I have dealt with stronger teams out there. What I am trying to do now is to instill confidence into the players,” said Mwanthi. He added: “By imparting this kind of knowledge to them, I believe they will be able to compete well and even pull surprises.” The team, alongside their male counterparts, athletics (men and women), basketball (men and women), football (women), and golf (men) will represent the country in the event. The teams have been in camp since April 1 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani.  President Uhuru Kenyatta officially flagged off the team on Tuesday. Kenya only needs to win two matches to be in the medal bracket. The team’s captain Timinah Barasa said their confidence has improved and thanked coach Mwanthi for helping improve their game.
