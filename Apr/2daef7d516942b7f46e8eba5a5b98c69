Detectives based in Langata, and DCI Nairobi regional command have arrested a suspected fraudster who pretended to be a white lady and obtained Sh150,000 from a man who was selling his car through a popular online site. DCI said Bob Nyongesa, disguised as Ryan Britney of Narok, called the vehicle owner, Ali, posing as a prospective buyer. Nyongesa expressed willingness to buy the  sleek Mercedes Benz at Sh1.4 million and requested for more photos of the vehicle posted on Jiji Kenya. "Convinced that 'Britney' was a serious buyer, Ali sent him more photos including the interior and other parts of the machine," DCI said. The sleuths further said that Nyongesa is a seasoned fraudster and has served jail terms at Kamiti and Kodiaga prisons. In the past, he has been imprisoned offences related to fraud . DCI added that on the purchase day, 'Ryan' called Ali and told him that while on the way to Nairobi from Narok, her vehicle had hit several cows and goats belonging to Maasai herdsmen. 'She' explained that the machete wielding herdsmen were at the verge of lynching her if she did not compensate them at Sh150,000. "Nyongesa, sent Ali images of livestock carcasses sprawled on a road and her purportedly damaged vehicle," DCI said adding that 'Ryan' promised to refund once she accessed her bank at Nairobi. Nyongesa was arrested in Ongata Rongai and several SIM cards, laptops and mobile phones forming part of his tools of trade recovered. He is awaiting arraignment tomorrow. DCI appealed to members of the public who have been conned by Nyongesa aka Ryan Britney to file their reports at DCI Langata offices.
