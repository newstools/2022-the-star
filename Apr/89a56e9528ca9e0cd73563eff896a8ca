Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi wants Kemsa to set up regional depots for quick delivery of medical supplies. He said counties have been forced to wait for months to get supplies because the depots are in Nairobi. The governor spoke after receiving medical supplies from Kemsa on Wednesday. “If we could have a depot for the coast region I am sure we could get supplies within days. Sometimes our hospitals run out of drugs but there is little we can do after we make the order,” he said The county received medical supplies worth Sh176 million. This, he said is 44 per cent of the medical supplies ordered. The supplies will be distributed to 150 health facilities in Kilifi county. “We had ordered medical supplies worth Sh385 million. We have talked to Kemsa and it is our hope that the remaining consignment shall be delivered soonest. "We have fast-moving drugs like painkillers that have not been included in this consignment. If we do not get the remaining supplies then there will be an uproar,” Kingi said. He said people will ask where medicines went to if they do not get panadol from our hospitals. The governor however said there is a robust system in place that ensures drugs are put to intended use. “The system shows when and to whom the drugs were administered to. This makes it hard for rogue medical staff to sell the drugs outside the facility," he said. Kingi warned officers against engaging in corrupt deals saying he will not hesitate to take action against them. "We know we have some who could be thinking on how to crack this system and sell the drugs,” he said. Kemsa county sales and marketing officer Leah Gichoya said the supplies will be delivered to six hospitals and 144 rural health facilities. “This is a mixture of pharmaceuticals, non-pharmaceuticals, x-rays and laboratory supplies,” she said Gichoya said the supplies are expected to last at least four months.
