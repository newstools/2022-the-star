Teachers from public, private, regular and special needs schools will start training for junior secondary on Monday. The teachers will teach Grade seven to nine. The training will start on April 25 and end on May 13. Teachers Service Commission CEO Nancy Macharia said the training will focus on all the subjects offered at junior secondary. “The first training will focus on languages, pure sciences, applied sciences, mathematics and technical subjects,” Macharia said. Six teachers from each school will train in the subject areas. During the training, they will be grouped according to their respective departments. Teachers teaching pure sciences will be trained on relatable subjects in junior secondary. They are biology, chemistry, physics and health education while applied sciences will focus on agriculture, home science and computer studies. “Under languages, teachers will teach English, Kiswahili, Kenyan Sign Language and indigenous languages,” she said. Macharia said training for subcounty directors, curriculum support officers and tutors from TTC will also be taking place. They will be trained from May 2 to 6. Since the adoption of the new curriculum, TSC has trained more than 220,000 teachers in three years. The commission targets to train another 191,515 teachers in the next three years. In January, some 1.5 million learners who are under the new Competency-Based Curriculum will transition from Grade 6 to junior secondary school. A final lot of more than one million of the Std 8 candidates under the 8-4-4 system will also be joining Form One after sitting their KCPE exam in November Therefore, more than two million learners will be joining secondary schools in January 2023. The government is putting up 10,000 new classrooms in secondary schools countrywide to accommodate the learners next year Out of the 10,00 classrooms, 6470 will be completed this month with the second phase of construction set to begin in May.
