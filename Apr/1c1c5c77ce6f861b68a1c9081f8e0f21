The 14th edition of the 'Road to Gleneagles' Johnnie Walker Golf Series scheduled for Nanyuki Sports Club this weekend has attracted over 100 golfers. The competition will be played under the four-ball stableford format at the par 72 golf course with the first tee-off set for 06:30 am. Golfers will be seeking to make the cut for the series’ semi-finals dubbed the Eagles’ Round to be played at Muthaiga Golf Club in May. This will then be followed by the Grand Finale, where the overall winners will get a fully paid trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland. The event follows the Muthaiga Golf Club leg played on Saturday, where an all-female team of June Waweru, Mercy Wambugu, Susan Mwangi, and Rose Koome emerged winners with 111 points. They beat the quartet of Kamau Thugge, Olive Njagi, Edgar Kalya, and Wycliff Kaisha who garnered 104 points for the second slot. Evans Vitisa, Selest Kilinda, Phil Kinisu, and Ted Njuguna returned a combined 101 points for the second runner-up position. The three joined the list of teams that have already qualified to play in the next round. Speaking during the event, EABL’s Josephine Katambo said: “We are proud to offer golfers across the country a tournament of this stature, and an opportunity to give lucky individuals the opportunity to travel to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland,” said Katambo. Following the event at Muthaiga, a total of 39 teams have now qualified to play in the next round following previous events held at various clubs around the country.
