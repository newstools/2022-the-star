UDA election board has expressed satisfaction with the ongoing party primaries being conducted countywide despite chaotic incidences witnessed in some areas. NEB chairman Antony Mwaura said they have witnessed incidences where ballot papers have been destroyed by unruly supporters and the late opening of polling stations. He cited Bomet where voting materials for four polling stations were destroyed and Embu where materials were burnt. "In Kisii, we had a shortage of ballot papers but that has been sorted," Mwaura told journalists at Hustlers Center in Nairobi. For Embu, he said that the party disciplinary committee has already summoned three aspirants linked to the fracas. The chairman said that Board has postponed primaries in Bumula, Kakamega County, Mt Elgon and parts of Turkana. Kakamega and Mt Elgon by-elections will be conducted tomorrow. For Mt Elgon, the youths barricaded the road blocking vehicles that were ferrying the materials. The chairman held that areas, where voting was delayed, was because of acts of violence or logistical challenges. The chairman also refuted claims that fake ballot papers were in circulation in some areas. He said the party's ballot papers are unique with distinct security features, including watermark and serial numbers, that make it difficult to reproduce them. The nominations are taking place in 35 counties across the country. Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki indicated that the party has witnessed changes in some areas leading to the delay in the exercise. He urged the party members to come out in large numbers even as he warned that the party will not condone acts of violence during the voting and tallying.
