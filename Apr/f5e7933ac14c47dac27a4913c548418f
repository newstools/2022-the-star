Preliminary investigations into an incident in which a woman’s body was found hanging on a window in her house in Langata, Nairobi, shows its suicide. This comes as friends of Vanita N Seghani, a mother of three, plan to hold a protest Thursday to register their dissatisfaction with the investigations. Vanita was found dead in her apartment in Langata Mandir Flats on April 3. Police said a postmortem done on the body concluded it was suicide. “She did not have any other bruises on her body to suggest someone beat her or forced the body where it was found. The autopsy concluded it was suicide,” Langata police boss Benjamin Mwanzi said. He said they are open to further investigations if there will be any other evidence to suggest to any other theory or motive. The body of the woman was found hanging on a rope on the window of her house. There was a stool next to the body, which police suspect she used to climb and reach a higher place to hang herself. A pair of slippers was also at the scene. The body was cremated days after the incident. A team of detectives from the DCI headquarters has been petitioned to take over the probe. The team plans to review CCTV footage around the house to establish if there was any other party that was involved in the death. Police said they had learned the woman was alone at the time the incident happened. Organisers of the protests say they will hold peaceful protests from Thursday to Monday at Shree Cutchhi Leva Patel Samaj, Nairobi West. “We will stay there till the Samaj committee members promise to give in writing and sign that there will be a proper investigation into the case,” the organisers said. There are divisions among the friends on social media regarding the death amid push for further investigations. (Edited by Francis Wadegu)
