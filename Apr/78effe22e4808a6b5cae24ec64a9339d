Nairobi County Assembly speaker Ben Mutura will spend Thursday night in police cells as he awaits to be charged over theft accusations. The Speaker was on Thursday grilled for about five hours over claims he stole money from his employer. Mutura presented himself at DCI headquarters at around 11 am accompanied by his lawyer. Investigators questioned him over claims that he stole by servant by allegedly making imprests for trips he never took. “He has been signing imprests for other staff members and later added his name in the list while he knew he did not travel out of the country,” said an official aware of the probe. The former Makadara MP was also questioned about a police ID he grabbed from one of the officers during his botched arrest on Wednesday at City Hall, Nairobi. The officers from serious crime unit were roughed up during the drama. Sources said police were considering to charge him over the said stealing. Mutura had not left the DCI headquarters at the time of publication of this article. Sources said he was likely to spend the night in police cells ahead of his arraignment on Friday. On Wednesday, Mutura said the DCI summon came after he called out Nairobi Metropolitan Services for being an illegal institution. “As it stands at the moment, NMs is an illegal entity as its extension was not properly constituted,” he noted. Mutura said NMs has to be brought to the assembly for the House to either approve or reject it.
