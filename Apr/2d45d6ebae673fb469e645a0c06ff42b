Diana Marua and Mr Seed's wife, Nimo Gachuiri, have finally reconciled. Speaking to Nicholas Kioko on YouTube, Diana said there is no bad blood between them. They attended an event together with their kids over the weekend. "People make mistakes and with time, you come to realise maybe you were not mature enough to handle it," she said. "Life teaches us lessons differently, we have never met after that incident. This is the first time I am meeting her and I'm happy. I have no beef with her." Diana added that the two have been communicating on phone. "There is a day I was going through something in my life and she called me and we talked. There are things you don't take to heart." The two fell out in 2019 after Diana Marua allegedly called the cops on Nimo while she was heavily pregnant. During the interview, Diana hinted she is expecting her third child. This is after a video of her showing a baby bump photo surfaced online. "If there is another baby coming, kids are a blessing and if I add another bundle, I think they will come with their blessings," she said. "That is the best gift I could give Bahati after he becomes the Mathare MP."
