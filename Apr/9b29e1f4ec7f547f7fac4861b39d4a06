In it, he sings about his dad dying due to high blood pressure because his family could not afford medical treatment. "There was a time there was no light in the tunnel. Generational curses result in death. Diabetes and blood pressure will murder you if you don’t have money,” he raps. Khaligraph adds that he contemplated suicide since he had given up but prayers helped him push through. He urges his fans to keep strong because winners never quit. "This am saying since it is something I have experienced. My dad was a victim and died due to the sickness, all along we were trapped in the system and hoped for the best. "I am telling you things I have not talked about so you understand why I value prayers. Keep strong real winners don’t quit. I contemplated suicide since I had given up on life. Eventually, I pulled through. "Where I am today is due to my mum’s prayers."
