Some 9,000 learners who sat the 2021 KCPE will be awarded government scholarships for their secondary education. Education CS George Magoha said on Wednesday the Elimu scholarships will go to bright but disadvantaged beneficiaries across the country. The Elimu scholarship programme is sponsored by the Kenya government, Equity Bank and World Bank. Around 9000 students from poor backgrounds have been benefiting from the programme annually since 2019. The scholarship caters for school fees, transport, learning materials and for the four-year secondary education period. "Four thousand of those children will come from urban slums and the others will be from every sub-county," Magoha said. He spoke on Wednesday at Kenya High School, Nairobi, where he commissioned a classroom. "I have known that even in Gatundui South, there are poor children there, even in my village there are very poor children there," Magoha stated. The CS confirmed that he will personally supervise the vetting of the beneficiaries to ensure that the sponsorship goes only to deserving cases. "What we shall make sure that is done is that we shall ensure we get the right candidates for this position, so you will see me in the field," Magoha said. On classroom construction status, the CS said overall, the exercise is 90 per cent complete save for some 10 counties which he said are at the final touches stage. He listed Nyamira, Kisii, Kisumu, Kirinyaga, Kitui and Nandi counties as  among those nearing the 100 per cent status. "I think they will complete by this week," Magoha affirmed. In terms of regions, the CS said the Northern region has achieved 100 per cent status while the Nyanza region will likely be the second to follow suit as it is currently at 97 per cent. "There are other regions which are doing very well like the eastern region. "We only have a few challenges in Lamu and Baringo which we are going to ensure that they are covered," he added. Each of the classrooms was constructed at Sh788,000.
