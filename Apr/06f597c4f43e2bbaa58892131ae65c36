Liverpool will face Crystal Palace in Singapore as part of their pre-season tour of Asia in July, the Premier League club said on Tuesday. Liverpool will meet Palace at the Singapore National Stadium on July 15, three days after facing Manchester United in Thailand. “The Reds previously visited Singapore for two hugely successful games in 2001 and 2009, and an open training session in 2011, and are returning to Asia for the first time since 2017,” Liverpool said in a statement. Asia and Australia were regular stops for major European clubs before the Covid-19 pandemic, with the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea attracting huge crowds for lucrative friendlies. Meanwhile, Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard said he wants wing back Ashley Young to extend his stay at the club after the 36-year-old’s deal expires at the end of the season. Young joined Villa on a free transfer from Inter Milan in June 2021, returning to the Birmingham club a decade after he left for Manchester United. “I’ve made it clear to Ash that I want him to stay around,” Gerrard said. “There have already been discussions. “The key to this will always be the player. He has to be happy, want to stay, negotiate and have his people connect to the club. “There’s still a lot to discuss and there’s no rush but I’ll make it clear that we’re very happy with him.” Former England international Young has made 23 appearances for Villa this season, including 11 starts. Villa are 15th in the Premier League on 37 points with six matches left.
