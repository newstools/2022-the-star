The national women’s wheelchair basketball 3X3 team has qualified for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. This is after the National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Commonwealth Games Association of Kenya) successfully applied for a bipartite allocation through the Commonwealth Games Federation. In support of athlete performance pathways, the Commonwealth Games Federation allocated Kenya a special invitation place in the female category. Team manager Alfred Simiyu said: “For the first time in history, we shall have the wheelchair basketball team participate in a major competition. We cannot wait to go and represent our nation as we aim for a podium finish with our four athletes.” The team has been training alongside their male counterparts at the Nyayo Stadium in preparation for the Games. They traveled for qualifications in November 2021, beating DRC, Gambia and Tanzania respectively only to lose to South Africa. The team will be making their debut at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham between July 29 and August 2. The team joins their basketball counterparts, who qualified earlier in both men's and women's event by virtue of being second-ranked in Africa behind Egypt. Commonwealth Games Chef de Mission John Ogola explained: “This is a great opportunity for our athletes. Our main aim stands to give all Kenyan athletes the best chance to represent the country. With this addition, Team Kenya athletes contingent now stands at 150 in 19 disciplines." In training are Beth Wanja, Joyce Ambasa, Alice Wanjeri, Stella Titoy, Phyllis Nyambura, Rahel Akoth, Caroline Wanjira and Eunice Adhiambo.
