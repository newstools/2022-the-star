Content creator Milly Chebby resigned from the public relations department in the office of the Deputy President to focus on content creation. The mother of one told SPM Buzz the salary was also too little compared to content creation. "I was in the public relations department at the Office of the Prime Minister and then the office of the Deputy President William Ruto. That is when I resigned," she said. Chebby has no regret leaving her job. "I resigned because personally, I love challenges," she said. "Every day I love waking up to something new. I don't like the obvious monotony and mark-timing and no growth whatsoever. There are times I would get to the office at 10am because I had no motivation." Milly Chebby creates YouTube content with her husband Terence Creative.
