Former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has settled the fine imposed on a man who was found guilty of shoplifting from Naivas supermarket. The court fined Alvin Chivondo  Sh100,000 or a one-year jail term for stealing goods worth Sh3,165. The goods included 5kgs of rice, 5 litres of cooking oil and 2kgs of sugar. The Star came across a document indicating that the former governor deposited Sh100,000 to the Judiciary M-Pesa paybill number. Sonko said that he made the decision as his normal way of reaching out to troubled people. "Many Kenyans are living in squalor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many will say that it’s PR but I like assisting people, that’s has been my passion since I was in high school in Kwale boys," Sonko said. He added that: "I have also promised to give him a one-month food stock plus offer him a job as well." Sonko has also asked opponents not to politicise Alvin's case, and that he did not pay his fine to seek any political mileage. Chivondo was the talk of the day in the country following the court's decision. ODM leader Raila Odinga called for the unconditional release of the suspect. In a tweet on Wednesday, Raila demanded Chivondo be released unconditionally. "Let Alvin Linus Chivondo be released unconditionally! Criminals are now getting a reprieve to campaign freely, while petty offenders are being jailed," Raila said. Raila somewhat accused the courts of acting out of sync with the prevailing economic situation in the country when sentencing Chivondo. The cost of living has skyrocketed in Kenya with prices of commodities like cooking oil, bread, and sugar hitting the roof.
