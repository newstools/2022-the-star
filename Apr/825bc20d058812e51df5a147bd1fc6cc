After over two month-break, Shujaa will be seeking to bounce back when the World Seven Series resumes at Singapore Sevens on Saturday. Innocent Simiyu's charges, who currently lie eighth on the log with 31 points, are in tricky Pool 'A' alongside South Africa, the USA, and Canada. Shujaa have a tough schedule this month with a World Sevens Series leg in Vancouver next in the line a week later and the Africa World Cup qualifiers slated for Kampala, Uganda on April 23-24. Shujaa open their campaign against the USA at 7:12 am. The two sides have clashed three times this season with Mike Friday's charges having the upper hand in two of the meetings. The USA won 14-7 and 24-21 in Dubai with Shujaa overturning the result with a 29-0 win a week later. Shujaa will then face champions South Africa in their second preliminary match at 10:40 am. Kenya will start the match as underdogs with the Blitzbooke unbeaten in 44 matches this season. In their previous encounter, Kenya lost 31-19 in Dubai. Kenya's final match will be against Canada at 2:05 pm. This will be the third meeting between Shujaa and the North Americans with Simiyu's charges coming out on top twice. The Kenyans won 26-14 in Dubai and 24-5 in Seville and lost 19-17 in Malaga. Speaking from Singapore, Simiyu said they are keen to improve on tackle completion and minimize their error rate in attack as they chase their second main Cup quarterfinal berth. “We are looking at improving in those two facets of play. Looking at our pool, we have had competitive matches against the USA and so it will be a close game. As for South Africa, they are the team to beat and we have to match them physically. Canada are a young side who can cause an upset," he noted. The Singapore Sevens is a 16-team event with powerhouses New Zealand and Samoa back in the fold. This means the two top teams in each pool qualify for the quarterfinal while the teams that finish third and fourth are relegated to the classification matches on Sunday.
