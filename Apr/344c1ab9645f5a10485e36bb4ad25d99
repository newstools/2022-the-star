The national scrabble team leaves this evening to Jinja, Uganda for the annual East, Central, and Southern Africa Championships set for this weekend in  Jinja, Uganda. The 3-day tournament starts on Friday and ends on Sunday with each player expected to feature in 27 games. The team that is also known as the Warriors, hopes to defend the title they last won in 2019. The team missed out on both 2020 and 2021 due to the coronavirus. Scrabble Kenya chairman, Bernard Amuke, is optimistic of pulling good results. A formidable team of 25 players and five reserves was named after the final qualifying round held last weekend in Eldoret. “We are traveling by road to Jinja for the tournament with an aim of retaining the title,” said Amuke. He said they will use Thursday to acclimatize before taking to the board for the next three days. “We are scheduled to play 10 games, followed by a similar number on Saturday, and end with seven games on Sunday. We hope to start our journey back to Kenya the same day,” explained Amuke. He said they have had challenges with finance but was happy that the players have had to dig deeper in their pockets. Team captain David Machanje said they have the best team and a win will be a great achievement. “We have the best team this year and we hope of defending our title. We know Uganda will pose a major threat but we will give the event our all,” said Machanje. Kenya team: Michael Gongolo, Allan Oyende, Tobias Outi, David Kimani, Martins Mutahi Stanley Njoroge, Bernard Koyyoko, Onani Magwanga, Muema Muumbi, Ayub Zande, Tom Mboya, Patrick Miriti, Tarus Kipruto, Richard Okech, Daniel Machanje, Andrew Wabwire, Fred Magu, Joseph Chavutia, Chrispine Kennedy, Paul Mathuu, Powell Kiplagat, Nicole Achan, Manase Otieno, and Kipkemboi Limo.
