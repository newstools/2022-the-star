ODM leader Raila Odinga will be forced to cut short his ongoing tour of the United States to attend retired President Mwai Kibaki's funeral. In a statement, his Presidential Campaign Secretariat's Press secretary Dennis Onsarigo said he will return to the country on Wednesday. "Azimio la Umoja- One Kenya Coalition flag-bearer Raila Odinga will cut short his ongoing US trip and travel back home on Wednesday ahead of the state burial of the former President Mwai Kibaki," he said. Raila left the country on Friday for a week-long trip of the US. "Party leader Raila Odinga this afternoon departed for the US for a one-week official visit. We wish our Party Leader and his entourage safe skies," the ODM party tweeted. His departure from the country came shortly after he unveiled the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance dream team for Nairobi. He has been accompanied by Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Ndiritu Muriithi (Laikipia) and James Ongwae (Kisii). Also in the entourage are former Kenyan Envoy to US Elkanah Odembo, Homabay County Senator Moses Kajwang' and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui. Raila was expected to have meetings with the US Chamber of Commerce, the US State Department for the National Security Council and also the Kenyan Diaspora community. He also planned on meeting various technology giants at Silicon Valley, San Francisco with a vision to promote IT and technology relations between the two states. On Sunday, the former PM met Kenyans living in Washington DC for a town hall meeting.
