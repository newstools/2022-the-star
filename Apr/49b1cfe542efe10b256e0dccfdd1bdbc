A club manager and a bouncer have been charged with killing a 38-year-old matatu driver inside the Deja Vu Club a month ago. The two were charged alongside six others for allegedly  beating up Charles Chege to death. They appeared before Justice Grace Nzioka and denied the murder charge. Victor Ouma, Victor Okeyo ,Benaya Sigiro,Robin KyaloShadrack Nyakundi, Brian Amadala, Xavier Werunga and Derrick Ambala are said to have  descended on  Chege on allegations that he stole another reveller’s phone. The eight were accused that on March 6, 2022, at Deja Vu club, Rapha road in Kileleshwa, they jointly murdered Charles Chege. In a viral video seen on social media, the suspects and bouncers are allegedly seen in a video beating the father of three senselessly using pipes and sticks in between blows and kicks. Chege, who was working as  driver in the Eastleigh route, was allegedly beaten to death by the establishment’s bouncers and his body thrown just a few metres away. Reportedly, the deceased’s 62-year-old mother is traumatised, unable to either sleep or eat. She is being haunted by the video of her son screaming and begging the bouncers to spare his life. An autopsy has since revealed the cause of death as multiple injuries sustained due to blunt force trauma. In court, the eight pleaded to be released on bond terms, saying they are from humble backgrounds. The prosecution, however, opposed their pleas. They were all remanded at the Industrial Area. The case will be heard on July 25.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
