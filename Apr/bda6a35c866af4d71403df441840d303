Tusker head coach Robert Matano has lashed out at the match officials who presided over their Kenyan Premier League clash against Gor Mahia at Thika Stadium for overturning a last-gasp winner. With the game destined for a draw, attacking midfielder Jackson Macharia found the back of the net a few minutes to the full-time whistle, only for the center referee to rescind his decision barely seconds after awarding a contentious goal. “It's so disappointing to even think that the match was being manned by FIFA referees,” Matano said. Matano accused the referee of bulking under pressure in the wake of heated protest by Gor Mahia players. “Such decisions are costly particularly at this stage of the competition. They shouldn't have changed their changed their mind just because of protests. It was a clear goal and no matter what happens the referee should stand by the rules of the game and respect it,” Matano said. The match was halted for a while after fans threw projectiles and invaded the pitch. The barren outcome has left the brewers rooted second on the log with 43 points, nine adrift of runaway leaders Kakamega Homeboyz. Gor are third on 42 points. Editing by Tony Mballa
