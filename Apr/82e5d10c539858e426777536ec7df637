Former world junior 800m bronze medallist, Lydia Nasimiyu Wafula is set to launch her Izmir Marathon title contest this Friday during the Kenya Prisons’athletics Championships at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Wafula, who started her career on track and ventured into road racing,  will compete in the 5,000m as part of her speed work and endurance in readiness for the Izmir Marathon in Turkey on April 16. “I have been training in Iten for hill work and Kip Keino Stadium for speed work ahead of the Prisons Championships. I am very confident as I tackle the event this week plus other international events,”  she said. The former track mistress, who won Kampala Marathon twice as well as the Kilimanjaro Marathon, said competing in the Prisons show will give her the much-needed psyche and motivation ahead of international assignments. She said: “Competing at the local races helps an athlete to muscle up for international races. I want to use the Prisons race to gauge my preparations for the Izmir Marathon." The sprinter, who made her name through pacesetting, said Izmir is one of the biggest races in Turkey and expects a tough challenge after failing to compete in Rome Marathon last weekend. “It has been a while since I made a trip to an international race after switching to the marathon. However, I feel I am ripe for the international challenge as I seek to improve my personal best as well as finish on the podium in Turkey,” she said. Coming from Lang’ata Women Prisons, she will be competing for the Nairobi region in the 5,000m and not her usual 10,000m. “Prisons have good runners and the event is a good build-up not only for me but also other athletes ahead of both Commonwealth Games and World Championships,” she noted.
