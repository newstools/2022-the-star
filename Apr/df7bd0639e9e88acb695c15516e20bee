As part of a stand-up performance in Indio, California, the Academy Awards presenter briefly addressed the moment Will Smith slapped him during the live telecast on March 27. This was after he compared his wife Jada Pinkett Smith - who has the medical condition alopecia - to G.I. Jane. "I'm OK, I have a whole show, and I'm not talking about that until I get paid. Life is good. I got my hearing back.”, he said according to the Palm Springs Desert Sun. It remains unclear whether Rock was joking, referring to a paid interview, a new show, or some other sort of compensation.
