Despite successfully defending his Eldoret City Marathon title, the 2016 Valencia Marathon champion Victor Kipchirchir was gutted at running a slower time than the 2:08:56 he set last year. Kipchichir clocked 2:13:10 as Michael Rotich (2:13:23) and Josphat Kipkoech Bett (2:13:58) finished second and third respectively. “I had a muscle pull in one of my training sessions at the beginning of this year and thought I could not run well today. I was trying to push to run a good time but my compatriots were not able to follow me. The weather was not good today. It was windy and sunny and that slowed me down,"  the Padova Marathon champion said. At last year's edition, Kipchirchir was returning to action after a long time in the wilderness due to a road accident. He also won the inaugural Machakos 15km Great Run and finished third at the Discover Nandi race. With no plans to compete in the near future, the 2012 Göteborg Half Marathon champion said he will be discussing his next move with his coach and management. In the women's race, Emily Chebet timed 2:29:38 to beat the tape, ahead of Sharlyne Toroitich (2:30:13) and Lilian Jelagat (2:30:23). The 25-year-old Chebet, who finished eighth last year, was elated about her podium place after many tries without success. “I thank God for making me number one in my third time of asking. Last year, I was number eight. After last year’s race, I went ahead to compete at the Istanbul Marathon,” she said. With a busy athletics calendar ahead, Chebet is hoping to compete at the Commonwealth Games and World championships. “I have improved on my time and I am now planning to run in the Commonwealth and World Championships. I thank God for enabling me to win today,” she said. Chebet added that the prize money has come at the right time, saying she will use it to help her mother and those in need. “I want my fans to continue praying and I thank them for their prayers. I promise to continue running well,” she said. Results Women 1. Emily Chebet-2:29.58 2. Sharlyne Toroitich- 2:30.13 3. Lilian Jelagat- 2:30.23 4. Emily Jepkemei- 2:30.52 5.
