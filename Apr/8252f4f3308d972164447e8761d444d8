Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has revealed why he did not throw his hat in the ring for the presidency in the August 9, polls. In an interview with NTV on Sunday, Matiang'i noted that he feels honoured by expectations from a section of Kenyans who wanted him to be on the ballot as a presidential candidate. He, however, noted that he could not vie for the presidency because he had to continue serving in his current capacity. Matiang'i divulged that President Uhuru Kenyatta's trust in him persuaded him to keep serving Kenyans as their CS for Interior. “I have heard those comments and am sincerely flattered, and I thank those who think that I can run for the presidency,” Matiangi said. "To be called to serve your country is a very noble thing. I will continue to serve Kenyans as long as am alive and God gives me the breath of life and strength." The outspoken CS appeared to suggest that he might in future consider running for the top seat even as he expressed satisfaction in serving Kenyans in any capacity. Matiangi said he is always ready to serve Kenyans whenever he is called to but at the same time urged Kenyans to respect his views and decisions. “I genuinely believe that the future belongs to the Lord. And the Lord orders our ways and orders our steps." "What we are supposed to do as human beings is when that call comes, and that opportunity arises. We rise up to the opportunity by the grace of God and do what is expected of us." Matiang’i has openly declared support for ODM party leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid even though he has lately kept off politics.
