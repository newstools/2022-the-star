The Political Parties Dispute Tribunal (PPDT) has rolled out plans to decentralize the tribunal to other regions. Speaking at the Supreme Court on Monday, Chief Justice Martha Koome said the move will ensure that Kenyans are able to access justice regarding political matters swiftly. "This will ensure that access to justice with respect to political disputes will be effective and it will always help solve disputes arising from party primaries countrywide," she added. She noted that in the past elections (2013 and 2017), political parties and politicians had to register disputes in Nairobi only. "This caused challenges in terms of accessibility of justice," she added. The President of the Supreme Court has directed the tribunal ICT officers in the stations to be on stand by to help those seeking filing assistance. She added that members of the public can use the tribunal's e-filing system to file their disputes instead of travelling to the stations. CJ Koome has assured the public that the PDDT and the courts are ready and prepared to handle any disputes arising from the primaries and the elections. An aggrieved member can file their claims at  Milimani Law Courts for Nairobi Region, Meru Law Courts, Mombasa Law Courts and Kisumu Law Courts. Other Law Courts include Kakamega, Nyeri and Eldoret.
