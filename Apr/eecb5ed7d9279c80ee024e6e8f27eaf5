If Samuel Kariuki Njoroge was saving all his monthly earnings from the Environment ministry since he was employed in January 2018, he would have Sh1,632,000 by the end of March 2022. But Njoroge has received a staggering Sh79,763,944 from the ministry in the past four years, attracting suspicion from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission over possible embezzlement of public cash. Njoroge was hired in January 2018 as finance officer II in job group K with a net pay of Sh32,000. Before he joined the ministry, he worked at Save the Children where his net pay was Sh27,000. He is one of the many public servants who are under the radar of EACC with the agency investigating possible irregular acquisition of public funds. High Court judge Daniel Ogembo on Monday allowed the anti-grant agency to freeze Njoroge’s account at Equity Bank for six months pending investigations into his source of wealth. EACC investigator Juliet Kavala in a sworn affidavit said Njoroge’s account had a balance of Sh22,467,999.96 by the time the agency sought freeze orders. The account was opened on August 21, 2009 and Njoroge is the sole signatory. Kavala said he receives his salary through the account and that his net earnings were between Sh31,000 and Sh42,246.70 between January 20-18 and March 2022. “Besides his salary, the respondent has inexplicably received numerous large sums of money from the ministry amounting to Sh79,763,999.96,” Kavala said. An analysis of the ministry’s  Integrated financial management information systems account showed Njoroge received an imprest in the sum of Sh3,991,300 from the ministry for the purchase of snacks. The Ifmis also showed Njoroge again applied for an imprest of Sh6,562,865 on June 30, 2021, and the money was credited to his account on diverse dates in July 2021. Between March 1 and April 1, 2022, he received a total of Sh1,240,895 from the ministry. The investigators said funds designated as purchase of snacks were irregularly acquired and spent. “EACC findings have raised reasonable suspicion that considering the respondent’s salary, the credits into his account are disproportionate to his known and legitimate sources of income and could have been obtained through corrupt conduct,” the affidavit said. The commission further said the cash in Njoroge’s accounts could be proceeds of corruption and are amenable to forfeiture to the state. The EACC prayed for orders to freeze the account, arguing failure to do so would render the intended civil recovery proceedings futile. Njoroge’s parcels of land and motor vehicles are among property to be preserved as well. “The commission is apprehensive that the respondent, in light of the on-going investigations, will in the intervening period withdraw, transfer and dispose the money in order to defeat the course of justice," Kavala said. He also said this could happen before "EACC completes investigations and commences recovery proceedings.” Justice Ogembo certified the application urgent and ordered the account frozen for six months. The case will come up for mention on May 9.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
