Thomas Tuchel doesn't believe Chelsea has a chance to come back in the 21/22 Champions league quarter-final tie against Real Madrid. His belief is tied on the disappointing performance his squad displayed at Stamford Bridge in the first leg. Karim Benzema inspired his side to a 3-1 win with a hat trick on a wet and windy night in west London. The win put the Spanish side in firm control of the matchup ahead of the return leg. Tuchel says he doesn't believe his team will manage a come back from the horrid defeat.
