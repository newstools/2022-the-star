Allyson Felix, the most decorated female track and field Olympian of all time, will retire at the end of the season. The 36-year-old American has won 11 Olympic medals, including seven golds, as well as 13 world titles. She competed at her fifth and final Olympics in Tokyo last summer. "As a little girl they called chicken legs - never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined I'd have a career like this," said Felix. "I have so much gratitude for this sport that has changed my life. I have given everything I have to run and for the first time, I'm not sure if I have anything left to give. "I want to say goodbye and thank you to the sport and people who have helped shape me the only way I know-how - with one last run. "This season isn't about the time on the clock, it's simply about joy. If you see me on the track this year I hope to share a moment, a memory, and my appreciation with you." Felix has won four Olympic golds in the 4x400m relay, two in the Olympic medals and one in the 200m.
