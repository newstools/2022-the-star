A man who masqueraded as an advocate while representing a suspect in a fraud case was on Tuesday arrested in a Milimani court. Edwin Motari who appeared before chief magistrate Wendy Micheni was unmasked by the court after he was questioned whether he had a practicing certificate from the registrar of the High Court. Motari, however, defended himself saying he had no practising certificate and was only holding brief for another lawyer who is on record for the accused. "I order the court orderlies to arrest this man and he be charged with impersonation contrary to the law," ordered the chief magistrate. Motari was representing Chadian Abdoulaye Tamba Kouro who has been charged with obtaining Sh76 million from former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana by false pretences. While representing Tamba, the alleged fake lawyer had submitted to court that he was on record for the accused and asked the court to release his client claiming he has no medical documents since he used herbal medication. The magistrate was shocked by the submission of the lawyer since the accused had previously told the court that the medical documents are in the possession of his advocate. He was immediately arrested and detained at Milimani law court cells for further interrogation. Motari is expected to be charged in court on Wednesday.   -Edited by SKanyara
