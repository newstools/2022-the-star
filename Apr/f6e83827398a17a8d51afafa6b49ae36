Nairobi governor hopeful Ben Mulwa has suffered a blow after the Wiper Democratic Movement Party revoked his direct nomination ticket. In a letter, Wiper’s National Election Board Chair Agatha Solitei revealed that Mulwa had not met all the requirements to contest for the seat upon a second review. "The NEB would like to inform you that upon further scrutiny of your application, we have ascertained that you did not meet all requirements as set out by our party election and nomination rules," Solitei said in the letter dated April 9, 2022. "The earlier unopposed candidate notification issued to you on April 6 has therefore been revoked," she said. Mulwa is former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko's spokesman. Section 18.1 of the Wiper Party nomination rules provide for the disqualification of aspirants with subsection (d) being on the basis of party contributions. "An aspirant shall be disqualified from seeking nomination for civic, parliamentary and presidential elections if that person has uncleared arrears with the party in terms of contribution," states the clause. The Kalonzo Musyoka-led party required gubernatorial aspirants to pay a non-refundable fee of Sh500,000 or Sh250,000 for special interest groups - women, youths and people with disabilities. The Wiper Party will hold its nominations this week alongside the Jubilee and United Democratic Movement (UDA) parties. Governor Ann Kananu, businesswoman Agnes Kagure and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) chairman Richard Ngatia are eyeing the Jubilee ticket for the gubernatorial race. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja is also in the race after he was last Saturday fronted as the UDA flag-bearer by Deputy President William Ruto. Westlands MP Timothy Wanyonyi is also gunning for the position on an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) party ticket.
