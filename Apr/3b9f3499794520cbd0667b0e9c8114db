Azimio presidential aspirant Raila Odinga has narrated how Kibaki became who he was. Raila who was speaking at Nyayo stadium on Friday said during the post violence election in 2007/08, they decided to shake hands after interventions. But he noted that there were those who were against it. "Kibaki agreed and we shook hands in 2007/08. But some people came to persuade him not to agree to the handshake," he said. "But we came out and shook hands. There were differences in handling issues but we were able to resolve them." Raila said they remained friends throughout that period. "We remained friends and he was an advisor to me. I have lost a friend, a true patriot and a great leader," he said. "His value will be known with time. Rest in peace." He eulogised Kibaki as an intellectual and as a politician. "He was a great Kenyan, he was a gentleman and a man of conviction, a man who loved perfection. I have worked with him in the opposition and in government," he said. Raila said that when he led the budget discussions, he came up with better positions. "Kibaki will tell you these people don't know what they are doing... bure kabisa...," he said. "But he was a gentleman. We worked together in cabinet. We have learnt a lot from Kibaki."
