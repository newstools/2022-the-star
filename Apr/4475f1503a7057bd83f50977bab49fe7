Manchester City fans are feeling less than confident going into the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico Madrid despite their 1-0 lead against last season's La Liga Champions. This is despite City going into the match with 1-0 advantage from the the first leg match at Etihad. The fans' fears are also evident despite a potential boost to their chances of progressing to the semi-finals as two important Atlético Madrid players have been ‘practically ruled out’ of the quarter-final second-leg clash. City have announced a 24-man squad for the Champions League quarter-final with Atletico Madrid. The game kicks off at 20:00 (UK) and we will have full coverage on the official Man City app.
