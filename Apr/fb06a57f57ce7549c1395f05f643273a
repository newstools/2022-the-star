Mathare MP aspirant Kevin Kioko, alias Bahati,  broke down while addressing the media at Luke Hotel Nairobi on Monday. The MP aspirant claimed that the party had recalled the certificate he had been given even after winning in all the opinion polls. He further said he was told to step down in favour of the sitting  MP Anthony Oluoch, a decision he was not ready to make. "I was told to step down after receiving the nomination certificate," he said, adding that even with the new developments he was not going to step down from the Mathare Parliamentary race. He complained of a fraudulent process in awarding the Jubilee party nomination certificate even after the party conducted free and fair primaries. "I personally have made a decision that I'm not backing down from the race. My name will be on the ballot on August 9." "I will not step down for someone that does not understand the needs of my people," he said. The MP aspirant said that he is a loyal supporter of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga but he felt he had been shortchanged. "I was competing against four others and I followed the process. I did everything as per the Constitution," he said. Bahati said he opted for the Jubilee ticket as he believes in President Uhuru Kenyatta's leadership. He affirmed that he will continue supporting the Azimio la Umoja team, saying it has a place for young people. Further, he urged Azimio to let him fly the party's flag in the August polls, claiming he was the only aspirant who understands issues affecting Mathare people. Elizabeth Wafula, a Mathare resident, said the residents were disappointed with the loss. "We are not pleased by the news that Bahati was told to step down. He is a youth and he understands us. We want him," she said. Bahati hopes to succeed the current MP Anthony Oluoch, who won the seat on the ODM ticket in the 2017 polls. Edited by Mercy Asamba
