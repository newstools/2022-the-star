Four Prison officers have been arrested for allegedly selling fake recruitment letters to unsuspecting Kenyans. According to the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti, the four, Sergeant Violet Gachomo, Corporals Beatrice Wambui Kamau, Florence Wanjiku Ndung’u, and Ben Mburu were arrested after selling fake letters of offer to Stellah Kemunto and Joash Ounde. Upon realising they were fake, the two rushed to Kiamumbi police station to report. "An operation to hunt down the rogue warders operating in two vehicles was launched immediately, leading to the arrest of the four at CIATA City mall in Ridgeways, Kiambu County, where they were hawking the documents," DCI said. The warders are based at Industrial Area Depot, Kenya Prisons Headquarters and Industrial Area Remand Prison. "Four prison warders are in custody for obtaining over Sh2 million from two Kenyans who had been promised employment letters in the recently concluded police recruitment exercise." Detectives said their accomplices escaped in a black Toyota Noah. "20 fake appointment letters (docket numbers) were recovered from the suspects and academic documents belonging to different applicants recovered in a Toyota Probox that had been turned to a recruitment bureau," DCI added. Kemunto and Ounde told police that they had raised the sum of Sh2 million to secure employment for their relatives. DCI said that the mastermind of the con scheme identified as Jefferson Kivuva is still missing. "Efforts to arrest him are at advanced stages." The four suspects will be arraigned on Monday.
