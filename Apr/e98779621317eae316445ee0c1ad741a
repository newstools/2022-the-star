Garissa county has approved crucial policies aimed at streamlining key sectors. The policies passed during an executive meeting chaired by Deputy Governor Abdi Dagane include Youth, gender early childhood development and education. Other were Budget Estimates for the Financial year 2022-2023 and Garissa Ward Development Fund Bill, 2022. Dagane said the policies were a result of collaboration, consultation, input and years of hard work by the technical team, experts from various government agencies and development partners. “We remain steadfast in formulating policies that touch on the lives of our people. We aim to create regulatory and coordination frameworks for the respective sectors,” he said. Dagane said the Ward Development Fund Bill will provide for the establishment of a fund by promoting development in the 30 wards. This he said will set up an institutional framework for coordinating development initiatives and projects and for connected purposes. “We must ensure the words are the centre of all this, we have to escalate every aspect of development at the grass-root level and ensure our people are involved,”  Dagane said. The meeting appreciated technical directors, Mohamed Sahal (partnership and coordination), Osman Gothad (youth affairs) and Ahmed Bashir (ECDE). Others were Ahmed Mohamed (Gender), county chief officers, WFP, Anglican Development Services ( Eastern) and ILO for their technical, expert and material input.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
