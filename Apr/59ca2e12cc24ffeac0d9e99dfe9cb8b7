The United Democratic Alliance on Thursday held its primaries in 36 counties. After the conclusion of the exercise, vote counting began in the areas where the primaries were held. As the tallying exercises were ongoing in various tallying stations, reports emerged that Igembe South MP John Paul Mwirigi has lost the UDA primaries. The MP had just shot in the social media trend over a public spat with Agriculture CS Peter Munya that degenerated into the issue of President Uhuru Kenyatta gifting him a car after the 2017 polls. Many social media users exploited the alleged loss of UDA primaries to ridicule him suggesting that he lost because of his 'disrespect to the president'. This is after the MP threatened to return the vehicle Uhuru gifted him citing blackmail and intimidation because of the present. Fact-checker has however found that there were no UDA primaries in the Igembe south constituency and in most parts of Meru County. "There were no UDA primaries for the Igembe South Parliamentary seat. Most seats in the county were brokered through consensus. Reports on MP Mwirigi losing are fake because John Paul is an unopposed UDA candidate," Meru county Star correspondent Gerald Mutethia told the fact-check desk. Kenyans can therefore treat the report on him losing as fake.
