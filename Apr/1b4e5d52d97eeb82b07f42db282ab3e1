Attorneys for the anonymous plaintiff filed a motion in the Los Angeles federal court on Wednesday asking for a judge to dismiss the case "in its entirety". According to Billboard, the request was made "without prejudice” meaning she could refile the case later. But in the end, she decided to drop the lawsuit with no explanation given. A spokesperson for the rapper said of the suit's dismissal, "It is not surprising that the plaintiff dismissed her complaint against the defendants. Her complaint was full of false allegations and deficiencies."
