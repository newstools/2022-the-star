Socialite Manzi wa Kibera has said she was in a relationship with Eric Omondi between 2017 and 2021. She told Word Is that Omondi cheated on his Italian ex-girlfriend, Chantal Grazioli, with her. "The first time I met Eric was 2016 then we officially started dating in 2017 until 2019 and broke up in 2020 then got back together in 2021. We were dating before we lost contact because of Chantal ," she said. Omondi denied the allegations, saying he did not know about Manzi wa Kibera until recently and he did not date her. Manzi wa Kibera said she was in Omondi's Wife Material show as a side chic because he had told her he had his eyes on the Tanzanian and Ugandan contestants. "I agreed to be his side chic instead of creating beef between us." The socialite said she was paid Sh6,000 for participating in the show.
