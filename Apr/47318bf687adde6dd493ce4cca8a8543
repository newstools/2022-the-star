World 10,000m bronze medallist Rhonex Kipruto says he will cut down on his participation in half marathons as he eyes a ticket to the upcoming World Championship in Oregon. Rhonex said his major desire this year is to don the Team Kenya singlet at the iconic Hayward Field in July and, as such, wants to be at his very best for the national trials on June 24-25 at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. "It is going to be a very busy season ahead and so I don't want to run in many races as I focus on the World Championship. My main aim is to make it to Oregon. This means running in fewer road races," the 2018 World Under 20 10,000m champion said. Rhonex's last road race was earlier this month at the New York Half Marathon, where he clocked 1:00:30 to clinch first place. Despite being a firm favourite to lead Kenya's charge for the 25-lap world title, Rhonex believes competition for places will be tough at the national trials. "The World Championship is a major competition and a dream for many athletes. At the trials, there will be runners from other regions and affiliates who will be gunning for the same thing. I expect it to be tough as it has always been," the 2020 Valencia 10km champion said. He was in exuberant form on Thursday as he breezed to victory in the men's 10,000m during the National Police Service Athletics Championships at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The Border Patrol Unit officer clocked 28:38.7 ahead of second-placed Joseph Kiptum (29:00.6) and Edward Bett (29:01.2) in third. "The race was good...I can't complain. I feel great, my body is in great condition. Next, I want to prepare for the national trials for the World Championship. It is all about taking it easy...one race at a time," Rhonex, who boasts a personal best of 26:50.16 in the 10,000m, said. At the same time, 2014 Commonwealth 5000m champion Mercy Cherono has asked all her fans to pray for her as she eyes a medal-laden year. Cherono said she would love to recapture her Club Games title won in Glasgow, Scotland as well as shine in other international competitions. "It would be wonderful to recapture the title because another medal means progression in my career. We also have all these other competitions, such as World Championship and Africa Championships so I need your prayers as I target all these," the 2013 world 5000m silver medalist said. She timed 15:20.12 to storm to victory in the women's 5000m during the Police Championships, as Beatrice Chebet (15:33.15) and Caroline Nyaga (15:44.14) finished second and third respectively. "It was tough as expected because the other competitors were in great shape. At one point, it was very windy and this posed a problem. All in all, I thank God for this victory," Cherono said.
