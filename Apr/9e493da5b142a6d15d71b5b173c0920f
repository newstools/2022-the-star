Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said that the results of some 441 students have been cancelled due to exam malpractice. Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results on Saturday, Magoha said they are still withholding the results of one school as there is a pending investigation. The CS said the cases involved unauthorized material, 223 impersonations cases, causing a disturbance, and collusion during the exam period. "I wish to categorically state that KNEC will not have any mercy on examination offenders who must be dealt with decisively," he said. He said some 203  mobile phones that would have been used to relay pre-exposed examination materials were confiscated. Magoha further said that ahead of the 2021 KCSE, the Government heightened measures meant to pre-empt any forms of cheating through the combined efforts of all the members of the Multi-Agency Team. "The result of this enhanced vigilance was that nearly all the cases of cheating that would have occurred were prevented." Magoha urged all stakeholders to support sustained Government efforts to end examination irregularities. Last year, some 287 students who sat the 2020 KCSE examination did not receive their results over cheating allegations. Magoha said that there was clear evidence that 287 students were involved in cheating. “Out of the 287, 211 of them had unauthorised material in the examinations room… mobile phones were 45,” Magoha said.
