Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) coach Sammy Kiki hailed his charges after dethroning Ulinzi Warriors as the Kenya Basketball Federation men’s champions. The porters stifled Warriors, a team that beat them twice in the regular season, from the start to win the decisive Game Five of the final series 80-61 at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium Monday. The tactician heaped praise on his young backcourt pairing of Lennox Wanje and Philip Odhiambo, who were playing for the porters for the first time at this level. “From their performance, you wouldn’t know they were playing at this level for the first time after joining us from the lower tier. Their combination in the last game was great,” said Kiki. “It was their speed and understanding that caused Ulinzi so much trouble. They were faster for Ulinzi, who could only match them in defence but not offence.” He added that the overall team performance over the year was commendable, adding that it was the endurance and speed of the guards that worked out in Monday’s win. “I used my fast guards effec. I knew Ulinzi couldn’t sustain the endurance that we have. And that’s what worked for us,” added Kiki. “I think we had a very good season. We only lost two games, to Ulinzi home and away. Ulinzi also lost two games.” “I have a good team... a combination of veterans and young players and, in fact, the young players have done a very good job towards the title.” “I know Ulinzi is a very good team. They have experienced players. Their guards are playing for Morans.” Odhiambo said: “It was a tight game but I felt we were fitter than them. We didn’t crack. This is my first season in the Premier League and, honestly, I personally wanted this title more.” Kiki also thanked the team management and the fans, adding that they will have discussions on the way forward once the celebrations sink in.
