Five voters who claim that they voted in last week’s UDA party primaries now want the court to block the party from forwarding the names of all nominees to IEBC. Four of them are Jubilee party members who claim to have voted in the UDA nomination in Kirinyanga County while one is an ODM member who voted in Uasin Gishu County. Kennedy Gachenge, Francis Mwangi, Stanley Wanjiku, Peter Mwangi and Edgar Ochieng now want the court to bar UDA from forwarding the names to IEBC for gazettement. “Pending the hearing and determination of the application, the court be pleased to grant conservatory orders restraining UDA from forwarding the names of the purported nominees to IEBC,” he said. They further want the court to also bar IEBC from taking any action including the publishing or gazetting of the names of UDA nominees following last week’s nomination process. Through lawyer Ndegwa Njiiru, Ochieng says he is a registered voter in Uasin Gishu County and a member of the ODM party but he participated in the UDA nominations at Bwayi Primary School polling station in Uasin Gishu. He claims that the polling clerks in charge of the nominations identified the voters from the IEBC voter register and did not have a membership register from their party. “UDA failed to provide its elections official with the mandatory members register in the various polling station for purposes of conducting the party primaries but instead heavily relied on and unlawfully utilized the IEBC register,” reads court papers. Mwangi argues that he is a voter in Kirinyaga and a registered Jubilee party member but he also participated in the UDA nomination process at Kinya Kiiru polling station in Kirinyaga. “While being a member of the Jubilee party, UDA allowed me to participate in their nominations of April 14, 2022,” reads court papers. Ndegwa claims that UDA has colluded with IEBC to conduct fraudulent nominations through the use of the IEBC voter register instead of the political parties' register.
