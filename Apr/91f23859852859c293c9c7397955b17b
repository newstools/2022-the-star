Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City will have no bearing on his team selection for the Champions League tie at home to Benfica.

The advantage could be enough for Klopp to consider whether to rest some of his top players for the weekend trip to Wembley.
