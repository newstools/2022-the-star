The move to implement a data system able to track progress of university students will be overseen by the National Treasury. Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yattani said the state organ will liaise with the Ministry of Education to monitor progress of this initiative. Once this is adopted, varsity students will be tracked using a data management information system. Members of Parliament have recommended the system that will also monitor how funds are used in the institutions. The system will help in identifying students in the college and those who either deferred or were discontinued. The Universities Funding Board was mandated to provide a report on the progress of the system in three months. “UFB establishes and implements the university education data management information system to promote accountability and improve management of disbursed funds,” the report reads. While submitting the budget policy statement to the National Assembly Education committee, UFB CEO Geoffrey Monari said the system will enable the government to properly fund institutions. “We want to give proper figures on the kind of funding the government is giving each public university,” Monari said. Apart from funding for primary and secondary school learners, Monari disclosed that the government also disburses capitation for university students. (Edited by Francis Wadegu)
