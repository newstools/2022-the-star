Rights groups have called on the government to be accountable for upholding commitments made during the Generation Equality Forum in Paris last year. In a Twitter Chat organised by Akili Dada, a girls’ rights organisation, a number of Women’s rights groups joined the call for action on the commitments. His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta made 12 bold commitments in June at the Forum towards achieving Gender Equality. Among the key commitments made were ending Gender-based violence by 2026 and Female Genital Mutilation by 2022. Commitments to providing adequate funding for achieving these goals were also made. “Kenya will invest 23 million dollars for Gender-based violence prevention and response by 2022 and up to 50 million dollars by 2026 through co-financing. Further, we will invest 1 million dollars annually for Gender-based violence and innovation annually by 2026," he pledged. Akili Dada called on the government to join Mexico and other Generation Equality Forum leaders to boldly commit to adequate financial resources as pledged. “Women and girls are calling on the Kenyan government to join Mexico and other Generation Equality Forum leaders to boldly commit adequate financial resources to the care economy for an equal, inclusive, and sustainable future,” they said. The Center for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW Kenya), the African Women’s Development and Communications Network (FEMNET), Kenya Land Alliance, and GROOTS movement Kenya also echoed the calls for accountability. In December, the rights group Better for Kenya lobbied the government to fulfil the 12 commitments it made through an online petition that was signed by thousands of Kenyans. As President Kenyatta’s tenure comes to an end, questions arise over who will take over his commitments to women and girls.
