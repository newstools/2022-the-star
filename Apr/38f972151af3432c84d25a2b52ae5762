Thomas Tuchel has admitted Chelsea will miss Toni Rudiger when the defender leaves Stamford Bridge this summer. Rudiger will leave Stamford Bridge after rejecting the chance to become the highest-paid defender in the club's history. Real is poised to wrap up Rudiger's signing on a fee transfer. Tuchel said he is a big personality and a big leader who takes fear away from his team mates. "He gives you confidence when he is next to you," Tuchel said. Rudiger played between fifty to sixty matches over 90 minutes on an incredible level of consistency, Tuchel said.
