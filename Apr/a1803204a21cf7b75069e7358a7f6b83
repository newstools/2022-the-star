A man, 75, who lured a six-year-old girl with games on his phone before defiling her has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Kibera magistrate Esther Boke gave the verdict against Wilson Motunde Enima after considering the prosecution and his (Enima) mitigations. "I therefore, convict him to life imprisonment, he has a right of appeal with 14 days," Boke said. The magistrate said the offence was barbaric and the prosecution led by Nancy Kerubo proved the case.  Several witnesses testified. Enima committed the offence on May 12, 2017, in Lindi, Kibera. While testifying in court the girl said the accused started touching her before defiling her. “I went to his house and he gave me his phone so that I could play some games, he sat on the jerrycan and started touching my thigh,” she told the court. “He then told me to remove my pant which I did but when I told him that my mother warned me against it, he proceeded and defiled me. It was very painful." The girl also testified that the accused was arrested after his mother knocked on the door of the house they were in. She said she was taken back home and her mother and grandmother checked her private parts to ascertain if she was defiled. “My grandmother checked me but she got nothing to prove, some days later my mother took me to hospital for further testing and it was realised that I was defiled,” she told the court. In his defence, the elderly man told the court that he had been given a sick off after he was injured by a machine at his place of work. Enima further denied committing the offence.
