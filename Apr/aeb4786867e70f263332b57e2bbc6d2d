Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is set for a spell on the sidelines after picking up a thigh injury in their defeat at Crystal Palace, the Premier League club said on Thursday. The Ghana international was withdrawn in the second half of the 3-0 defeat on Monday, with manager Mikel Arteta saying he had a problem in the same area as a previous injury. "Thomas has since received further assessments, and a subsequent scan has shown muscle damage to his right thigh," Arsenal said in a statement. "We will continue to assess Thomas in the coming weeks, during which time he will also receive further specialist consultations." The injury is a major blow to the north London club who also lost left-back Kieran Tierney for the remainder of the season with the Scotland international requiring surgery on his left knee. Arsenal are fifth in the standings with 54 points and a game in hand, behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur on goal difference. Arteta's side next hosts Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.
