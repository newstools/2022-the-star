@robertomollo3 A Homa Bay police officer has been charged with defiling a Standard 8 girl in Rangwe. Josephat Kiate Muindu, attached to Rangwe police station, was charged with defiling the 15-year old girl. It is reported that Muindu defiled her at Rangwe police lines. The officer was charged with having carnal knowledge of a minor at Rangwe police lines on April 12. Muindu was also accused of committing an indecent act with a child. He was charged with touching her genitals. The police officer pleaded not guilty before resident magistrate B. Toroitich. He was released on Sh200,000 bond or Sh50,000 cash bail. The minor who sat her 2021 KCPE scored over 370 marks. Homa Bay children’s officer Joseph Otieno said the girl was defiled when she went to the station to seek help after a family dispute with her mother. The girl wanted to discuss with her mother how she could transit to secondary school because her father had died. She was allegedly kicked out of their home over the dispute. The girl fled the homestead and went to the police station for help and where she thought she would be safe. He said the girl found the officer who led her into his house and defiled her. “After the ordeal, the girl escaped from the suspect’s house and went to a female officer who accorded her asylum the same night,” Otieno said. The girl has been protected by the Homa Bay children’s department office. The case has five witnesses. The hearing of the case will start Thursday. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
