Everyone who watched President Mwai Kibaki's funeral service at Nyayo Stadium on Friday will agree that it was one of the best-organised state functions we have witnessed in recent years. The National Funeral Steering Committee asked Kenyans to conform to the laid-down requirements, saying proceedings would be conducted in strict conformity with military rules. We commend the Catholic Church for directing leaders to desist from political talk during their speeches. Kenyan political players have perfected the art of politicking at funerals and would have ruined the function had they been allowed to speak politics. With the main protagonists for the August 9, 2022, presidential election contest Deputy President William Ruto and Opposition chief Raila Odinga among those listed to speak, allowing politics would have shifted focus from honouring the great leader that was President Mwai Kibaki. We also commend the military for the full honours accorded to Kibaki as deserving of his statesmanship. Since his passing away on Friday last week, the military has done a commendable job, liaising with Kibaki's family and the National Funeral Steering Committee chaired by Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to organise a befitting sendoff for a true Kenyan hero. As we continue to mourn the fallen head of state, we salute everyone who has helped make Kibaki's funeral a success. Kenyans hope politicians will respect his family's wish to keep politics out of Kibaki's burial ceremony. Quote of the Day: "Government will no longer be run on the whim of individuals."
