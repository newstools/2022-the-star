Nakuru County Senator Susan Kihika has denied claims that she is a Jubilee mole in the United Democratic Alliance party. In a message she shared on her social media handles on Friday, the Senator dismissed the claims as far-fetched. "Waah I have been falsely accused of many things in my political career but never being a Jubilee mole in UDA, haithuru (doesn't matter)," she said. She further noted that she has forgiven those behind the reports saying such are common in a political season. "It's the high octane political season where anything goes. Lakini ni sawa. Nimewasemehe. Ngai mbere," she said. Loosely translated to: "It is okay. I have forgiven you. God First." Earlier, Naivasha Constituency MP Jayne Kihara accused Kihika of meeting Jubilee Party leaders at night and passing UDA inside talks to them. “Senator Susan Kihika has not been truthful and is teaming up with our political opponents in the Jubilee Party to ensure that only her preferred candidates sail through,” Kihara said. She claimed the Nakuru Governor aspirant is supporting her Naivasha parliamentary position opponent John Kihagi of Jubilee. Kihika has, however, maintained that she is firmly in the UDA party and in support of deputy president William Ruto's presidential bid. "For the avoidance of doubt, hapa ndio tuko! Na hatusongi! Ignore fake propaganda by desperate bloggers! Ruto the 5th," she said.
