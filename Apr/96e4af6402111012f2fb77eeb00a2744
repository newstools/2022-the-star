ODM leader Raila Odinga has appointed former Cabinet Secretary Raphael Tuju as executive director of the Azimio la Umoja secretariat. "The appointment, which Hon. Tuju has accepted, takes immediate effect," a statement by Raila's spokesman Dennis Onyango released Tuesday read. He said Tuju was considered on grounds of being an accomplished communication specialist, and experience in management of public affairs. "A communication specialist by training, Hon Tuju has decades of experience in politics and government, having served as member of Parliament, Cabinet Minister and Jubilee Party Secretary General." As Executive Director, Tuju will coordinate all member parties of Azimio and will lead the strategic and program teams that will work to ensure the coalition's victory in the August 9 elections. The appointment comes barely two months after Tuju announced his resignation as secretary general of the ruling party. The former Rarienda MP said he was grateful for the president's trust in him despite coming four kilometres from the home of his chief opponent. "Thank you for standing with me even at a personal level when I had a horrific accident until now I am able to stand here." Tuju did not reveal his next steps but said the president had given him other responsibilities. "We have agreed with the president that he will give me other responsibilities going forward," Tuju said.
