Two minors aged 17 and 15 were at the weekend arrested as they tried to sneak in several rolls of bhang into the Industrial Area Remand and Allocation, Nairobi. The girls had gone to the facility posing as relatives of a prisoner in the facility and wanted to deliver him some food and clothes. It was when the officials at the facility searched the luggage that they found the bhang. They were interrogated and later handed over to police at the Industrial Area police station for processing. Police handling the case said they want to establish if the girls were sent by someone known to them to deliver the cargo. They may appear in court Tuesday. This comes as authorities start using an amended law that seeks to enhance penalties meted on drug traffickers and narcotic smugglers in a bid to rid the country of increased cases of illicit drugs. This was after the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act was gazetted in readiness for application. The law was earlier on assented to and was on March 7, 2022 gazetted ahead of its application. Research findings have shown that Cannabis Sativa (bhang) is the drug of choice for most drug abusers in Kenya. The law provides the framework for combating abuse of narcotics, drugs, and psychotropic substances in Kenya. Drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, crystal meth, stimulants, painkillers and prescription drugs have reduced some youth into zombies. Substance abuse remains a huge menace and is a major challenge with negative impacts on social, economic, governance and criminal justice sector. The amended Act has defined precursors and chemical substances that could be used in the manufacture of narcotics. Severe penalties will be handed to persons who manufacture, possess, or transport precursor chemicals for unlawful production of a narcotic drug. Nacada said 1.5 tonnes of heroine was seized in Kenya in 2018 making it one of the countries with seizure of the largest quantity of heroin.
