Kenya Commercial Bank women's volleyball captain Edith Wisa has criticised Kenya Volleyball Federation for its delay in releasing league fixtures for the upcoming season. Wisa said the uncertainty has affected their preparations considering they do not know their opponents. "Every opponent has a different style of play so to prepare well, we ought to know who we are facing. Though the team is ready for the coming competitions, each and every player is psyched up and working bearing in mind every person has a chance to play," Wisa said. The Malkia Strikers blocker is, however, optimistic of a better performance by the bankers as they have been rectifying the mistakes that cost them the national title last year. KCB lost to their archrivals Kenya Prisons in a heated final of the previous season at the Makande Gymnasium in Mombasa. "We want to cure ourselves of the heartbreak we suffered in last year's final. The defeat is what fuels us in training and have been putting in a lot of work behind the scenes. We believe we have what it takes to claim the national title," Wisa said. Echoing her skipper's comments, outside hitter Mercy Moim said they are raring to go for the new season — regardless of the uncertainty over league fixtures. "Despite us not knowing when or who we will play, we have been training hard and playing friendly matches to keep fit. We recently played Prisons, which was a good outing for us," the national team skipper said. Japheth Munala's side have a crowded in-tray in the upcoming season, which includes the Confederation of African Volleyball (CAVB) women’s African Club Championship on May 19-June 1 in Tunis, Tunisia. The team has only played one league game this season against Vihiga County in February.
