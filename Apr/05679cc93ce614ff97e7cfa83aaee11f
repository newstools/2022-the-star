Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has named Faith Muli as his running mate for Machakos governor bid. “Here is a professor from Ukambani. She comes from Mwala, Vyulya and she knows more about leadership. She has also vied for several political seats,” Muthama said. The gubernatorial aspirant spoke during former Machakos Town MP Onesmus Kikuyu’s burial ceremony at Kitulu Day Secondary School in Machakos on Saturday. He said his choice of running mate was driven by the fact that he wanted someone he could work with. “I was also looking for someone who can easily interact with Machakos residents and effectively deliver to them,” Muthama said. The former senator said other qualities were intelligence, humility and a down to earth person. “I didn’t want to choose someone who will be speaking English to you on top of trees, but a person you can easily reach and interact with,” he said. He also criticised Governor Alfred Mutua’s ten year leadership as the county’s chief executive officer. “Mutua is winding up his ten-year term, can you show me a single project done by him here?” Muthama said. He said residents should vote him as Machakos governor and they will not regret. “Don’t vote for me because I want the seat, but because I want to resurrect the county,” the former senator said. He said he has unexplainable love for the Kamba community and all he wants is to set high standards, for them not to be disrespected. Muthama said residents should vote for UDA candidates since Deputy President William Ruto will win the presidency on August 9. He said it is important to elect leaders from the same party, who will give Ruto an easy time when he becomes the fifth president. Others contesting for the seat are former Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti, CCU leader Nzioka Waita and Mavoko MP Patrick Makau. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
