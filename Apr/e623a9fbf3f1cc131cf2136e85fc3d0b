Deputy President William Ruto has said the recently read 2022/23 Budget expenditure estimates will be thoroughly amended before the national assembly. Speaking in Limuru Constituency, Kiambu County on Sunday after attending the church service at the ACK St. Peter’s Muongoiya, Ruto said that the budget will be opposed by the Kenya Kwanza Alliance MPs once it is tabled before the House. According to the DP, if the budget estimates goes through the Parliament without amendments, Kenyans will suffer more. “Hiyo budget inataka kuongeza bei maji, sijui iongeze bei ya mkate, sijui iongez bei ya unga, sijui iongeze bei ya nduthi. Sisi tunataka kuwaambia hiyo budget haiwezi kupita kwa Bunge,” Ruto said. This translates to: That budget wants to increase water bill, to increase the price of bread, to increase the price of cooking flour, to increase the buying price of motorbikes. We want to tell them that the budget will not go through the Parliament. Ruto added that even if the budget manages to go through, they will still fine tune it in three months to ensure that it accommodates all Kenyans. “Na ikipita kwa Bunge, miezi mitatu baadaye tutibadilisha iwe ni budget ya mwananchi wa kawaida (And if it is passed, we will amend it in three months’ time to ensure that it is resonates with the common citizen.) Garissa Township MP Ade Duale had also said that they will impose several amendments on President Uhuru Kenyatta's last budget that was unveiled on Thursday. Duale, in a direct message to Treasury CS Ukur Yatani, said they will ensure legal processes are followed to the latter. Duale said the President's last budget is unconstitutional since legal parliamentary processes were breached.
