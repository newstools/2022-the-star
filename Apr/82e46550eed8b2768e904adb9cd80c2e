Teachers Service Commission (TSC) boss Nancy Macharia has announced that the training of teachers who will be in charge of junior high schools will start this Monday and end on May 13. Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results on Saturday, Dr Macharia said the first training will involve 60,000 teachers drawn from both public and private schools. She said the ministry is well prepared to ensure the success of CBC which is now at Grade six level. “We want to tell the country that as teachers we are well prepared for Junior High school that is starting in January,” she said. She said they will have at least 116,000 teachers by December ahead of the January intake. The TSC boss also said the government had introduced Mwalimu Award to recognize well-performing teachers. "President Uhuru Kenyatta has today approved the proposal by TSC to introduce the award," she said. She said TSC will recruit 5,000 teachers after the National Treasury allocated Sh2.5 billion for recruitment of teachers. The country is short of 114,000 teachers and the commission will prioritize sub-county schools.
