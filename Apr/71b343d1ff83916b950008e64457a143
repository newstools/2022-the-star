Former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende says he is firmly in the Vihiga gubernatorial race and will soon launch his campaigns. Marende on Monday told the Star on the phone that two previous attempts to officially launch his campaigns were futile but he remains in the race. “Yes I can officially confirm to you that I am in the race and I will be on the ballot on August 9,” Marende said. The former Emuhaya MP has been on and off in the campaign trail after failing to officially launch his campaigns on April 5 as had been previously scheduled. A rearranged date of April 9 also failed to start the campaigns. Marende said he rescheduled his campaign launch to allow an MP aspirant to commission his constituency offices in Luanda. Both will be running on the DAP-K ticket. He said he joined the Azimio la Umoja so he can campaign for ODM leader Raila Odinga. He will be banking on his political experience as MP for Emuhaya and former Speaker to battle it out with the incumbent Wilber Ottichilo at the ballot. Ottichilo is defending his seat on an ODM ticket. Marende’s entry in the race could divide the Bunyore votes as both him and Ottichilo come from the same subtribe. Others in the race are Senator George Khaniri from the Tiriki subtribe, former Governor Moses Akaranga and Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi, both from the Maragoli subtribe.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
