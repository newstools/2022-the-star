Classic 105 presenter Maina Kageni says drinking women can also be wife material. Giving his opinion during the Morning Conversation, Maina said drinking does not change a woman's character. "She has gone to the club with her money, so why are you bothered?" he said. "Our great grandmothers used to smoke, so where is the problem? The hurdles women have to overcome in this society are just incredible." Mwalimu King'angi said he is worried that men who are still single might have a hard time getting people to marry. "Back in the days when a woman went to the club, she was there to sell her body. Women nowadays know when reggae nights, soul nights, and other nights happen."​ A listener called Odulele said a woman shouldn't smoke or drink and if they do, they should stop once they get kids or start a family. "Our great grandparents used to smoke in the bushes because they did not want to be seen." A frustrated Kenyan mum called in, sharing how her son is cu​rrently dating a woman who drinks. "Maina, how can you advise our sons to marry such women? Such ladies might even beat us if they get married to our sons."
