Tanzanian singer Diamond Platnumz says featuring on Netflix reality show 'Young, Famous and African' opened international doors for him. Diamond is in London for a world tour to promote his EP, ‘FOA’. Speaking to No Signal, a London-based media house, he spoke about his success this year. Diamond said his fans have increased globally. He explained that on the premiere day, his DM went crazy, with people from all over the world calling and sending him congratulatory messages. He said he had a different experience working on the show. Unlike when he is shooting music videos, Diamond said the reality show took time. "It was amazing doing the reality show. I wasn’t used to shooting shows. You know, music videos take a day or so. The show took like a month," he said. "Everything went perfectly and they had a great team. It proved to the world that Africans can deliver something like the best. That experience changed me." Diamond added that the reason people appreciated him more is coz he was real and people want to be entertained and see celebrities’ love life. "After the show, even people who never treated me well started calling me," he said, adding that currently all his international shows are sold out. "It changed my life and added my fanbase. I have got a world tour after that. I respect that and I can’t wait for the next season to come."
