Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. Crust Cheese filling  Blueberry sauce Preparation Step 1 To prepare the blueberry sauce. Combine the cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved then set aside. Using a sufuria, bring the blueberries, sugar, ½ cup of water, and lemon juice over medium-high heat to a simmer. Stirring constantly, cook for about 5 minutes until the blueberries break apart, and the sauce stops foaming. Step 2 Stir in the cornstarch mixture and bring the sauce to a boil. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until it has thickened and reduced. Step 3 Transfer the sauce to a shallow heat-proof bowl, and allow it to cool before returning it to the fridge. Step 4 To prepare the crust, line the bottom and the sides of a 9-inch pan with parchment paper and set it aside. Step 5 In a medium bowl, combine the Oreo cookies, sugar, and melted butter and stir until the crumbs are evenly moist. Transfer the crumbs to the prepared pan and press the crust into the bottom and halfway up the sides. Freeze the crust until you are done with the filling. Step 6 To make the filling, in a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the whipping cream and 2 tablespoons of sugar on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Step 7 In another mixing bowl, mix the cream cheese, ½ cup sugar, and vanilla essence on medium-high speed until creamy, combined, and no lumps. Then add the chilled blueberry sauce (must be cold and as firm as jelly) and fold it into the cream cheese mixture until well combined. Be careful that you don't overwork the filling. Step 8 Transfer the filling to the prepared crust and spread evenly but carefully without deflating the filling. Sprinkle some blueberries and then chill in the fridge overnight.
