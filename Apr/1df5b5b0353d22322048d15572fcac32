The Pamoja Africa Alliance party has fronted lawyer George Kithi as its Kilifi County governor seat candidate. Kithi received his nomination certificate on Wednesday at the PAA head office in Nyali, Mombasa. The party chairman Ibrahim Mtwafy Babangida handed him the nomination ticket. Kithi will now fight it out with ODM’s Gideon Mung'aro and Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa of UDA who are in the race to succeed Governor Amason Kingi. Kingi is serving his second and final term. All the three candidates have been vote hunting ahead of the August 9, 2022, General Election. Kithi was among the many candidates who were awarded certificates by the party at the Nyali head office. Those who were cleared and awarded certificates included candidates for county wards, woman reps, parliamentary, senatorial and gubernatorial seats.
