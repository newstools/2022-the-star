Samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, that includes ingredients such as meat, chicken, spiced potatoes, onions, and peas. Depending on the region, samosas may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes. In Kenya, most samosas are triangle in shape and mostly have minced meat filling, potatoes or mashed green grams(Ndengu). Ingredients: Preparation Step 1 Combine the boiled potatoes and peas and mash them together in a sufuria. Step 2 In another sufuria, over medium heat, heat a little oil. Add in the onions, garlic, ginger, black pepper, salt, turmeric, chili, garam masala, and coriander. Step 3 Take a sheet of samosa Patti, lay it in front of you, spoon some filling in and fold it like a samosa. Once you fold it to the end, apply the paste made with flour and water and fold it to stick it. Step 4 Heat some oil for deep frying, drop in the samosa and fry till golden.
