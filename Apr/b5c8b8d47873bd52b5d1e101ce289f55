Businesswoman Agnes Kagure will vie for the Nairobi governor's seat as an independent candidate. This comes less than 24 hours after a deal was sealed at State House for Polycarp Igathe to fly the Azimio-One Kenya Alliance flag for Nairobi  County and be deputised by Westlands MP Tim Wanyonyi. Kagure announced on Friday that she had no plans of abandoning her governor ambitions. "We began this journey years ago and officially launched it on January 7. I have no plans of abandoning the hundreds of thousands who believe in it halfway," she stated. The businesswoman confirmed that her dream of a better Nairobi that is supportive of talents and ambitions, a city that is the envy of other cities, and a county that takes care of its residents is firmly on course. "As I have been reminded severally, this is no longer about me but about us. Better days ahead," Kagure added. On January 7, Kagure launched her manifesto which involved revamping water supply, sanitation and health care for all and reorganising public transport to ease movement. She also pledged to improve safety and security throughout the city. If elected, Kagure promised to create 200,000 new jobs annually during her tenure. In 2018, Kagure was among four other women that former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko had shortlisted to deputise him after Igathe's resignation. They were Karen Nyamu, Jane Weru, Agnes Kagure and Bishop Margaret Wanjiru but Sonko never settled on any for presentation to the Speaker of the County Assembly.
