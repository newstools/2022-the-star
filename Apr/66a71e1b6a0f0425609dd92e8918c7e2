Nadia Mukami and Arrow Bwoy are set to hold a wedding to seal their union. In a QandA session with her fans, Nadia said Arrow Bwoy is a great dad to their son. "He is still a fiancé, he has not paid for dowry and we have not danced in my traditional wedding," she said. "I am waiting for my son to be stable to do a wedding." Another fan asked her how it is like dating a celebrity. Nadia said she never looks at her fiancé Arrow Bwoy as a celebrity but a person she loves. The couple welcomed their son in March. She said she is planning to get another baby before she hits 30 years. Nadia is currently promoting her EP, 'Bundle of Joy', a project celebrating motherhood. Speaking about the project, Nadia said it expresses her new life phase. "I am experiencing new joy and appreciate the gifts given to me," she said. "It also expresses my gratitude to God for the blessings I have received. "The project will showcase me as a new mum and how I will navigate it. Fans should expect to feel all the emotions that I had as I poured my heart out in the EP. "I am opening up to my fans and letting them experience my journey with me." The EP features Iyanii, Arrow Bwoy and Latinoh. ‘Acha Mungu Aite Mungu’, a spiritual intro full of gratitude for God’s blessings as she carried on her pregnancy. ‘Kai Wangu’, featuring Arrowboy, speaks about her excitement of her growing a family. ‘Saluti Kwa Mama’, featuring Iyanii, is the journey to motherhood, highlighting the struggles and celebrating the joys of raising a child. ‘Zawadi’, features label mate and rising singer Latinoh on an overwhelming appreciation of God and her baby daddy for the precious gift of her newborn that surely sets her on the next chapter of her life. The project is also a befitting honour to her late children Lola and Safari. Nadia with Arrowboy recently launched the Lola and Safari Foundation aimed at supporting young mothers experiencing challenges with pregnancy and childbirth.
