Former Nyaribari Chache MP Chris Bichage has blamed ODM for his loss in the party nominations. Bichage claimed the party denied him the ticket to run for the parliamentary seat and handed it to his rival James Kenani, despite being loyal for many years. "I have been an ODM member for many years but it was unfortunate that I was denied the ticket," Bichage said. He declared that he will vie for the seat as an independent candidate. "I want to tell my supporters not to lose hope but continue supporting me because I will be on the ballot," he said. Bichage served as Nyaribari MP for eight months before his election was nullified by the court following a petition filed by the incumbent MP Richard Tong'i. Bichage will face Tong'i,  Zaheer Jhanda, Kenani, veteran journalist Eric Obino, former Kisii Roads executive Vincent Sagwe and Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko for the seat. "I am optimistic the electorate are not going to chose leaders based on parties but agendas, ideologies and policies," he said. Bichage said if elected, he will focus on agriculture, education and opening of feeder roads. He pledged to help avocado farmers in Keumbu secure a cooling machine and boost their supply chain. "Avocado and bananas farmers are suffering  because middle men have been exploiting them many years, it is time for county to address their problems because agriculture is a devolved function," he said.
