Double Deaflympics champion Simon Cherono Kibai is seeking to lower his men's 10,000m record at the 24th Summer Deaflympics in Caxias Do Sul, Brazil from May 1 to 15. The former Soya Sports Personality of the Year winner first broke the title in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2013 after posting 29:16.00 and emerged the winner again in Samsun, Turkey in 2017, where he lowered his record to 29:11.73. He hopes to lower the record further this time around. Kibai, who has been training in Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet County was the overall best athlete in both editions of the global championships. Speaking at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani where the team Brazil-bound team is camping, Kibai said: "My target in Brazil is to smash that record for the third time. I'm targeting a sub 29:00.00." The 35-year-old added: "I was rusty after missing out on major events for a long period due to Covid-19. My personal training schedule has revived my shape. I feel I'm on course to realise that dream in Brazil," he said. He revealed that his training program entails long runs on Mondays and Speedwork on Tuesdays. "Wednesdays are for extensive hill work before speed work again on Thursday and long runs on Fridays. I take part in a 25-km run on Saturdays while Sundays are for brisk walks and rest," he said. Kibai said he is physically and emotionally prepared to defend the 10,000 and 5,000m in Brazil. He will, however, not defend the 1,500m which he won in Bulgaria in 2013. "Apart from the 10,000m, I'm also looking forward to defending the 5000m crown, and probably breaking its record," he added. "Team Kenya has relatively new and young athletes full of energy and competing with them in the category will be such a huge task," he said. The father of two plans to venture into marathon running after Brazil due to the age factor. "I'm not growing any younger, so I have planned to exit the scene gradually. My next target is the 42km race where I want to take over from defending champion and title holder Daniel Kiptum."
