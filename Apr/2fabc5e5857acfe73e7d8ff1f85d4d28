Are three chickens worth a human life? Police are investigating the stabbing to death of a man, allegedly by his brother, in a quarrel over missing chickens in Senyende village in Kakamega county. Police are holding Bonventure Lumwachi, 37, in connection with the stabbing death of his brother, Augustine, 35. Bonventure is admitted to Kakamega County General Hospital in critical condition after he was attacked by villagers furious over his brother's death. The suspect is reported to have killed his younger brother whom he accused of stealing three chickens from his house. Their relatives said the victim was stabbed in the chest with a knife. Relatives said they had quarrelled over the missing chickens. The body was taken to the local mortuary. Shinyalu subcounty police commander Robert Makau said villagers attacked the suspect before he was rescued and taken to hospital. “The suspect is undergoing treatment at the Kakamega County General Hospital under security and he will be charged with murder once he is discharged from hospital,” Makau said. Such violence is common in poor villages, especially during hard times amid pleas to resolve disputes amicably. (Edited by V. Graham)
