Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has said the Competency-Based Curriculum will not be scrapped even after his tenure ends. Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results on Saturday, Magoha said the implementation of CBC is at the midwifery level. “Who is this saying he will scrap CBC,” he posed. He said some 6,407 classrooms for junior secondary schools had so far been completed and some 3,000 classrooms will be completed by August. "The construction of the classrooms will not be interrupted by the general elections. We are not politicians," he said. "Phase two of the construction of CBC classrooms will begin in May and the classes will be completed before President Uhuru Kenyatta leaves office." He noted that the roll-out of the CBC curriculum is on course and the inaugural class is scheduled to join Grade 6 when schools re-open on Monday. "Consequently, after schools re-open, there will be more than 9 million children learning under the CBC curriculum," he said. Earlier, the CS had said CBC is steering learners away from exam-oriented learning and equipping them with skills that will enable them to prosper in future. He said money pumped into implementing the curriculum would have been wasted if CBC is scrapped. Magoha said they have trained enough teachers for the programme. The Competency-Based Curriculum under the 2-6-3-3 system of education in Kenya was unveiled in 2017 to replace the 8-4-4 system of education.
