Gem residents have refuted claims made by ODM parliamentary aspirant George Midiwo that the party primaries were rigged in favour of his opponent. The residents have urged Midiwo to accept defeat and make peace with the electorate's decision. "I'm honorably requesting Midiwo Jalang'o to accept defeat. The elections were done peacefully," a resident said. On Friday, Midiwo appealed to the ODM National Elections Board to conduct fresh nominations saying the exercise was unfair. This came after Elisha Odhiambo was announced the winner for the ticket. Odhiambo won the ticket with 7,405 votes against Midiwo who came in second with 6,384 votes. "I ask of you to have self introspection to reflect back and think what you want to be remembered for and not someone who took people to court everyday," another resident added. They reiterated that the process was fair and transparent as it was done electronically. They further lauded Azimio flagbearer Raila Odinga for bringing about a technologically driven election process. "This is better as we don't have to queue for long and we can see the winner." Other MP aspirants who have won the primaries are Gideon Ochanda of Bondo and Sam Atandi  of Alego Usonga. Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi and Rarienda MP Otieno Amollo were presented with direct tickets because they were unopposed in the primaries. Women Representative Christine Ombaka was also awarded a direct ticket. The ODM primaries are ongoing until April 21. Edited by B. Oruta
