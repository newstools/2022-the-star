Khaligraph Jones has told bloggers to stop castigating artistes who refuse to be interviewed. In a recent interview, OG said sometimes he is not comfortable being on camera. "People have their way of living their lives, whether an artiste or a normal person," he said. "If I don’t want cameras on my face all the time, that’s a personal choice, it is not about showbiz or whatever. Khaligraph is currently promoting his new album ‘Invisible Currency.’ He explained that it comes from the strength of your brand and how much you have invested to build it. "You can have 1 million in your pocket but when we stand together, even with your 1m, I will still tower over you. The OG is the OG because the currency I have is invisible," he said.
