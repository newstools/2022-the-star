Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika has refuted claims that she is not seeing eye to eye with Deputy President Ruto's aide Farouk Kibet. According to Kihika, social media claims that she was slapped by Farouk are untrue and that her opponents were out to drive a wedge between them. "The issue that he slapped me is laughable. I do not have any issues with Farouk, he was the best man at my wedding so he is a family friend," she said. Kihika says that the bloggers who came up with that story were hired by her opponents to promote propaganda. The sentiments come after Kihika was accused of being a Jubilee mole in UDA party. She dismissed the claims as far-fetched. "I have been falsely accused of many things in my political career but never being a Jubilee mole in UDA," she said. Kihika has, however, maintained that she is firmly in the UDA party and in support of deputy president William Ruto's presidential bid. Recently, Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara accused Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika of bungling the UDA primaries in Naivasha. Though Kihara has since received the party nomination certificate, she accused Kihika of colluding with her opponents so she would lose the nomination. Kihika had no competition so she was awarded the UDA ticket for governor. Kihika is seeking to unseat Governor Lee Kinyanjui in the August 9 General Election.
