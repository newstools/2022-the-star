Comedian Propesa has denied fathering Carol Sonnie's baby. He shared a screengrab from a story published on a local blog, claiming he fathered her child. On Friday, Mulamwah denied being the father of Carol's child. Word Is reached out to Sonnie, who refused to comment on the issue. On her Insta stories, the content creator shared a motivational quote. "Stay strong," she added. Propesa wrote, "This is a fake story from a fake blog. Don't accuse me of something I don't know. Mulamwah himself had revealed all this that happened in Gitaru, Arrow Den apartment. He even mentioned the room number and I don't stay there. Msiniwekelee mambo sijui hata." Mulamwah and his ex-lover have been trading barbs on social media since their breakup.
