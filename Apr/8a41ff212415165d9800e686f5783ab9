Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka wants him out of the Azimio-One Kenya Alliance structures. In a statement on Wednesday, the governor said that it has become impossible to work with the former Vice president in the Ukambani region under Azimio. Kibwana said that he has no choice but to make peace with this reality and he hopes history will be kind to Azimio presidential aspirant Raila Odinga. "It is proving impossible to work with Kalonzo Musyoka in Azimio in Ukambani. After he joined us, he has wanted me out of all Azimio structures," he said in a tweet. "I have no choice but to be at peace with this sad reality. History will ultimately judge all of us." This comes a few days after Kibwana called on Kalonzo to embrace inclusivity in the Azimio-OKA coalition. The governor said that all parties that support Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga should be allowed to campaign for him. "Kalonzo should embrace inclusivity, not a three-legged philosophy... Winning elections is about numbers. Let all political parties that genuinely support Raila be welcome in the coalition and campaign for Azimio," he said. His remarks came after OKA parties wrote an objection letter to the Registrar of Political Parties Ann Nderitu, claiming a breach of the agreement. Secretary Generals of Wiper (Shakila Abdalla) and United Democratic Party (Bernard Wafukho) wanted the coalition registration suspended. They claimed that a fourth leg was added to Kalonzo's infamous three-legged stool. The inclusion was set after eight fringes of the coalition threatened to exit blaming exclusion. Musyoka's relationship with three Ukambani governors; Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni), Alfred Mutua (Machakos) and Charity Ngilu (Kitui) has been strenuous.
