Deputy President William Ruto has eulogized the late President Mwai Kibaki and described him as the greatest president Kenya ever had. While delivering his tribute at Nyayo National Stadium during his state funeral, Ruto said Kibaki was a distinguished public servant both in the opposition and government. "He is a great son of our country. We celebrate his achievements, his contribution and his rich and solid legacy," Ruto said. The DP said Kibaki rose from a humble background from the village in Othaya where he tended goats to become a great leader, one that other leaders have learnt a lot from. "The fourth president of Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta has learnt a lot from him. Kenyatta has been a good student of president Mwai Kibaki, I know that as his deputy," Ruto said to a loud applause. He lauded Kibaki for establishing a firm foundation in education and infrastructure development and for being what he termed an architect of the Kenyan economy. "When the history of Kenya is written, Mwai Kibaki will not fit in paragraphs, he cannot fit in chapters. We need more that that for what he has done for our country," Ruto said. The DP said Kenya's great infrastructural development which has since 2013 been advanced by the Jubilee administration was the brainchild of the late president. "He sowed the seed and laid the foundation upon which our fourth president built the infrastructure development we see today," Ruto said. The DP said that he has no doubt the fifth president shares the same vision and will seek to farther KIbaki's legacy on infrastructure and economic development. "It is a heavy moment but I take pride in the heritage that we have built as a nation. "We can stride into the future on the foundation of our forefathers including Mwai Kibaki's. May his soul rest in peace," Ruto said.
