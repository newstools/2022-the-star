Kirinyaga County Governor on Tuesday was forced to apologise at the Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders meeting held at the Ngong Racecourse, Nairobi after she mistakenly referred to DP William Ruto as "Azimio leader". The Kenya Kwanza Alliance led by Ruto was formally signing coalition agreements with its constituent parties during the event. It is when Waiguru was ushered to the podium to speak that she inadvertently referred to the DP as the "Azimio leader" during the introductory part of her speech. "Your excellency the Deputy President of Kenya, the party leader of UDA and the leader of the Azimio group... Sorry, my goodness,? Waiguru said. She immediately clarified that she was thinking of chiding the Azimio outfit hence the slip of the tongue. "...And the leader of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, my sincere apologies, because I was thinking about what I will say about them." The incident generated a lot of buzz on social media as her critics suggested that the incident is a testament that her heart could still be in Azimio. The eight parties joined the formation during the signing of the Coalition Agreement with Kenya Kwanza founding parties, UDA, ANC and Ford-Kenya. Ruto, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wentangula witnessed the occasion. Each of the parties will retain its distinct identities while supporting the Kenya Kwanza Alliance flag bearer in the presidential contest. Other parties which joined the formation earlier are the Democratic party and Safina. Politician and lawyer Kithure Kindiki said that no party was coerced into joining the coalition. “Every party signing today has had a draft prepared and consensually agreed. Nobody has been coerced to come and sign or intimidated,” he stated.
