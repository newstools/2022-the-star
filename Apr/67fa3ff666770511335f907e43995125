A sombre mood engulfed parliament buildings on Tuesday as hundreds of Kenyans trooped in to view the body of the late President Mwai Kibaki. It was the second day that Kibaki was laid in state for Kenyans to pay their last respect. Emotions ran high as a section of those who viewed Kibaki's body could not hold their tears upon confirming that Kenya's third president was no more. Officers and paramedics had to attend to Kenyans who were not able to contain their emotions. Kibaki's body arrived at Parliament Buildings in Nairobi from Lee Funeral Home on Tuesday morning for the second day of public viewing. The retired President Kibaki's body will lie in state till Wednesday at 5 pm. A state funeral in honour of Kibaki will be held on Friday at Nyayo Stadium. The government made changes to the funeral programme of Kibaki regarding the public viewing of his body on Monday. The late Kibaki will be laid to rest on Saturday.
