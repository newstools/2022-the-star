Rapper Kanambo Dede has released her second single called One Day. She became famous after videos of her rapping went viral. Kanambo was then signed by King Kaka under Kaka Empires. One Day encourages people who are going through tough times to hold on as dark times don't last forever. "One day tutamake it but for now we cooperate na hali, and give thanks for what we have," Kanambo said, adding that she wrote the song. In her first single, Kanambo narrates how she got pregnant as a teenager and how disappointed her mum was. King Kaka said he is helping Kanambo to be the best version of herself. "We are moulding her, we have signed people over the years and our intention is not to steal from people," he said. "When you sign an artist it hastens his/her way to the top. If we had not signed her she would not be here. "Let's not be quick to bash. No one is forcing her to do anything. If she does not want to be signed well and good."
