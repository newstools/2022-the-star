Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has taken an early lead in Tuesday's United Democratic Alliance party nominations. Keter, who wants to defend his seat on Deputy President William Ruto's UDA party ticket, was leading after the vote count in 83 polling stations out of 101. The incumbent has so far garnered 7901 votes in the 66 polling stations while his closest challenge Bernard Kitur had 5525 votes. Earlier in the day tension was high at the Nandi-Hills UDA primaries' tallying centre after Nyeri woman representative Rahab Mukami was chased away by youths who accused her of leading a scheme to rig out incumbent MP Alfred Keter. Mukami is a UDA party “Observer” in the primaries. Keter supporters claimed she was leading a “high powered team” out to ensure MP Keter does not clinch the UDA ticket. Security was heightened at Samoei high school, the UDA tallying centre, where it was alleged that a team had been dispatched to ensure Keter's rival wins the seat. Reports emerged that in Keter’s strongholds, ballot papers were missing while in other areas, ballot papers were few forcing the voters to refuse to vote. They returned to vote after they were implored by the MP to cast their votes. Keter, the incumbent MP, faces one of the toughest tests yet in his political career as he is being perceived as a pariah in the UDA camp by close allies of deputy president William Ruto. The nominations were postponed following the death of UDA aspirant Wesley Kogo in a road accident in Kangemi, Nairobi, has attracted seven contestants seeking the ticket. Aspirants running against Keter include Benard Kitur, George Tarus, Robert Chepkwony, Lilian Lelei, Irine Chemutai and Abraham Limo.
