Alcohol is one the drugs that is commonly abused. There are generally three types of alcohol: Wine, liquor and beer. It brings us together to enjoy life and celebrate with friends. However, its excessive consumption is harmful to one’s health and it should not be sold to persons under the age of 18 years. Despite this law, people still sell alcohol to teens who are under age. The youths tend to blame alcohol consumption on stress as they assume or think that alcohol relives stress. Little do they know that it actually worsens the situation. When drinking, one gets hyper and excited only for them to sober up the next morning and realise the problems toward the drinking are still there and they did not vanish with the drinking. There are other healthy ways to relive stress and anxiety such as meditation, counselling by professions, listening to music or even watching movies, among other ways. Excessive alcohol consumption also comes with negative effects such as diseases, poor decision making, and may lead to ugly situations such as irresponsible sex, infection of diseases, loss of jobs due to poor performance at work, separation of families and road accidents.  The youth should, therefore, keep off alcohol to avoid killing their future dreams by doing mistakes that can be easily avoided. They should engage in healthy activities such as sports, art and dancing, among other activities that will help them keep away from alcohol and drugs. And for those who must have a drink, take it easy. Don’t over indulge.
