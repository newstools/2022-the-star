IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati has asked all the political parties to ensure that the two thirds gender principle is implemented in their nominations for the 290 constituencies. In a letter on Wednesday, Chebukati said that “You’re hereby reminded that all political parties participating in the upcoming general election must comply with the existing statutory obligations, and ensure all lists of the nominated candidates for the 290 constituency based elective positions for the Member of Parliament and 47 County based positions for the Members of Senate must comply with the two-third gender rule,” Chebukati said. He said that in the event that a political party presents 290 candidates, for Constituency based elective positions, not more than 193 candidates should be of the same gender. Chebukati added that in the event a political party presents a list including 47 candidates for county based positions for members of senate, not more than 31 candidates can be of the same gender. He said that if the nomination list does not comply with the two-third gender requirement, the commission will reject the list. "The commission will reject the list and communicate the rejection in writing to the political party," Chebukati said. The commission will however, provide an opportunity to the affected political party to revise the list and re-submit the revised list to the commission within 48 hours. Also, a revised list that will not have complied to the gender rule will be rejected in its totality and all candidates on the list cannot stand for election come August 9.
