The Eldoret Golf Club will play host to this weekend’s 6th leg of the Safaricom Golf Tour as the tournament makes its way to the Rift region. The event has drawn over 200 golfers from Rift Valley and its environs including the Western region counties of Bungoma, Kakamega, and Trans Nzoia. The senior tournament is scheduled to take place on Saturday with the junior event scheduled for Sunday. “Our last five legs have attracted huge turnouts in all the regions we have toured. Having our sixth leg at the ‘City of Champions’ is yet another chance of advancing our goal of nurturing young talent and demystifying the sport. This region is known for producing athletics champions and I believe we can do so in golf as well,” said  Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa. So far, the Tour has been held in Nanyuki, Limuru, Muthaiga, Nyanza, and Machakos, attracting over 1,000 senior and junior golfers. As a way of leveraging the Safaricom and Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) Partnership, young participants can register with JGF for KES.1,000, which will enable them to access any golf club across the country for a whole year. Meanwhile, Eldoret golf club captain Nathan Tororei has said Kenyan golf future belongs to junior golfers hence mentoring is key. “We want to ensure that the juniors compete well in such tournaments because they are our future,” said Tororei. He said: “We have a strong field of both juniors and seniors who will make the day successful in the two-day event,” he said.
