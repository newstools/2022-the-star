Former Nairobi Diaries actress Maureen Imbai, alias Black Cinderella, can never settle with a stingy man. The actress believes that no woman should be using a cheap mobile phone. She provided a solution to men who would say they do not have enough money to get the phone. "You are sleeping comfortably with your two kidneys and yet your girlfriend doesn't have iPhone 13 Pro Max??? Shame on you. Heartless person," she wrote. She made it clear she will never say 'yes' to a stingy man. "Two kidneys for what?? Wait oo, kidney that you will waste with alcohol. Sell it, my brother, and change your woman's life. Don't be stingy. After all, when God removed one of your ribs to create me, you did not die."
