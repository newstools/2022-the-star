The quartet of Peter Kaburu, Henry Ruhohi, Peter Njuguna and Lucy Gichimbiri scored 119 points to seal the 15th leg of the Johnnie Walker Golf Series at the Kiambu Golf Club over the weekend. The team of Michael Karuga, George Kuria, Michael Karanja and Alex Mukui finished second with a combined score of 110 points, three more than the team of Michael Karanga, Michael Nyangi, Caesar Mugo and Ken Mwaura in third. Handicap 13 Johnstone Kimanzi beat Joseph Muchigi — off handicap 16 — on count-back to claim the men’s category title having carded 39 points. In the ladies’ category, Kiambu Golf Club lady captain Jane Kanyi’s 37 points were enough to claim top spot ahead of Susan Kanyora (33 points). Peter Kahuho carded 21 points to win the 'first nine' while Anthony Githegi scored 21 points to win the 'second nine'. In the longest drive challenge, Joyce Wanjiru and Peter Waiharo were the stars in the men’s and women's categories respectively, while Ndiga Kithae picked up the plaudits in the 'nearest to pin challenge'. The top three winning teams now join the list of players that will proceed to the next round of the series dubbed the Eagles Round at Muthaiga Golf Club in May. They will be aiming to qualify for the Series’ Grand Finale to be played at Karen Country Club where a fully paid trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland will be up for grabs. So far, total of 45 teams have now qualified to play in the next round following previous events held across the country. Attention now shifts to the Western Region at Kakamega Golf Club which will host the sixteenth leg of the series on April 23.
