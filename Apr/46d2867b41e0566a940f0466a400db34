Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria is of the opinion that ODM leader Raila Odinga will betray President Uhuru Kenyatta in the event he is elected president in the August 9, polls. Kuria claims that the ODM leader will not keep the promise of sharing his government with Uhuru in the ratio he alleged forms put of the Handshake brothers' deal. Kuria appeared to say that Raila and his constituents have fought for power for years and that they won't give such a huge portion of government to Uhuru after a decades-long fight for power. "In the unlikely event Raila becomes President, he will do Uhuru Kenyatta a good one. So Uhuru thinks he will get 40% of government and Kalonzo 30% and Raila is left to share 30% among his ODM base after fighting for 60 years to be President between himself and his father? Hata Baba hapangwingwi," Kuria wrote on Facebook on Friday. Remarks by Kuria come even as Uhuru publicly campaigns for Raila despite him being his main competitor in the last two consecutive polls. The Head of State has been open to his Mt Kenya region about Raila's candidature saying he is the best fit to protect their interest. The ODM chief has before said that President Uhuru is going nowhere after the August 9, polls as he is likely to serve as his advisor. Uhuru, though he has made it clear he will retire in August, was handed a new five-year term to serve as the ruling Jubilee party leader. The move raised eyebrows about what he will do with the role considering his predecessors seemingly quit politics after going into retirement.
