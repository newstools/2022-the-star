A wetland in Limuru subcounty, Kiambu, has been destroyed by fire. The Friday fire is suspected to have been started by boys who were grazing on the Roromo wetland. It spread rapidly fanned by winds from the neighbouring Uplands Forest. The 30-acre wetland is the source of River Lioki. It also contains a borehole that serves parts of Lari, Bibirioni and Ndeiya. Smoke from the fire covered the villages of Roromo, Murengeti, Gatitika and parts of Ngarariga. Kenya Forest Service officers led by Uplands Forest station manager Isaac Waweru arrived and helped the residents to put out the fire. Besides the wind, the dry vegetation also contributed to the fire's rapid spread, Waweru said. “Even though some are still green, some vegetation on wetlands is dry, that is why you see fire on a wetland. Also, the water levels have gone down,” he said. Waweru urged residents to avoid lighting fires near forests as most vegetation is dry. He urged them to pass the message to their children. Kiambu firefighters showed up but they could not drive their trucks into the wetland for fear they would get stuck in the mud. They turned back. Resident Simon Ndirangu thanked the rangers for helping them. “We were all armed with long twigs. We worked tirelessly to hit the flames until we contained them. The fire did not spread to our homes or farms, which neighbour the wetland,” he said. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
