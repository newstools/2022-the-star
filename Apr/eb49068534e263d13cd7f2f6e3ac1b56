Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Tim Wanyonyi has affirmed his resolve to go all the way to the ballot ahead of party nominations next week. The Westlands MP has denied claims of ongoing negotiations to have him drop his bid of becoming the city's administrator in favour of a Jubilee candidate. This follows reports that consultations are ongoing to have him cede his ambition and be the running mate to a Jubilee candidate under the Azimio la Umoja ticket. The reports also claimed the talks sought to convince the legislator to continue with his legislative roles in the National Assembly. Wanyonyi dismissed the reports. “I’m going for the top seat and will accept nothing less than the Governor’s position. My supporters and Nairobi residents at large should know that I’m firmly in the race to be Nairobi Governor,” Wanyonyi said on Wednesday. The city legislator also rubbished claims that he would be shoved aside because the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) Party leader Raila Odinga is going for the Presidency hence Nairobi’s top seat should be left for another party. While expressing his optimism, Wanyonyi said he will be unveiling his running mate soon after engaging with the ODM party leadership on the most suitable candidate. “I will propose a name and then the party will decide because it will have to be involved. With wisdom, I believe ODM will help me choose the most appropriate running mate,” he added. ODM Party nominations for Nairobi have been scheduled for Thursday, April 21, 2022. Wanyonyi, who launched his candidature last December, is part of the gubernatorial aspirants who have rallied behind the Azimio la Umoja coalition which supports Raila’s presidential bid. Other aspirants eyeing the city's top seat include the incumbent Governor Ann Kananu, businesswoman Agnes Kagure, Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) chairman Richard Ngatia and Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja.
