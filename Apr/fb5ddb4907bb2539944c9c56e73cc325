After an underwhelming performance in Singapore, Shujaa have been pitted against Fiji, USA, and England in Vancouver Sevens this weekend. Innocent Simiyu's charges had a weekend to forget in the city-state,  winning two matches and losing three. They beat Canada (24-7) and Japan (12-10 ) but lost 12-10 to the USA, 26-5 to South Africa, and 19-10 to Spain to finish 10th overall Kenya bagged five points and slipped down to 10th overall place on the log with 36 points following the lethargic performance. Simiyu said they must improve in several aspects of play ahead of the start of the next tournament this weekend. “We did not attain our targets considering we had wanted to improve on our execution," he added. Kenya will open their campaign against the USA before taking on Fiji, who are defending champions. They face England in the final match of the preliminary matches. Skipper Nelson Oyoo said they have to minimise their errors in the next leg in Canada. “The series is quite competitive and small errors are punished. However, I believe there is room for improvement for the next leg and we must be sharper,” added Oyoo. The Vancouver leg will be ideal preparation for the Africa World Cup qualifiers slated for Kampala on April 23-24 and Oyoo said they need momentum. "We need wins under our belt so that by the time we head to Kampala we are in peak condition," he added. In Pool 'B', Singapore runners up New Zealand will go up against Samoa, Wales, and Japan. It will be the second tournament for New Zealand and Samoa. Singapore 7s bronze winners Australia face World 7s Series leaders South Africa, Spain, and hosts Canada in Pool C matches. Pool 'D' has Ireland who will battle against Argentina, France, and Scotland. The top two teams qualify for the main cup quarterfinals while the third place and fourth teams drop to the classification matches.
