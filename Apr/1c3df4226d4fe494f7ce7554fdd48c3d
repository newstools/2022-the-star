Security chiefs are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to review the security situation in Lamu County. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i who is in Mombasa to chair the meeting and other security-related engagements said the meeting will review the curfew imposed on parts of Lamu in January this year. The National Security Council declared four divisions within Lamu West and Lamu Central sub-counties as ‘disturbed areas’ and ordered the deployment of special security units to the area. The deployment followed attacks that claimed at least seven lives and the evictions of many families. “We will review the actions we took in Lamu to see if we can lift the curfew if life (in the County) has become normal,” the CS said. The CS, who was speaking at the Kenya Coast Guard Services headquarters in Liwatoni, said the Government had ramped up security along the Kenyan coastline and in other water bodies in the country as part of the preparations for the general elections. More equipment has also been procured and additional personnel seconded to the Coast Guard to prevent terrorist-linked attacks and other seaborne crimes including drugs and arms trafficking. He said the levels of security preparedness had been raised in response to the challenges posed by the election season and urged citizens to be on the lookout for potential criminals hiding in political campaigns to perpetrate illegal acts. “The challenges of terrorism are with us and from time to time, we have to be conscious of what we do and who is near us, especially in this season of politics,” he said. He however repeated his assurances to MPs on Tuesday that security officers have been mobilized and strategically deployed across the country to secure the entire electoral season. The CS urged coast leaders to exercise caution in their political pronouncements to ensure the region that has experienced incidences of ethnic-based tensions in past elections remains peaceful.
