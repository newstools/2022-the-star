Tanzanian singer Rayvanny has allegedly ditched Diamond's record label. His fans noticed some changes on his Instagram bio. Previously, it read, 'From East Africa Tz, BET Awards winner, signed under WCB Wasafi,' followed by links to his current music. A few days ago, his bio changed to; 'CEO NLM Music', tags of his company 'Next Level Music' and a BET Award winner. Rayvanny has been a part of Wasafi for more than six years. He started his label last year and issued a statement saying he would continue working with Wasafi. In January this year, fresh reports came that Rayvanny was asked to part with TSh2 billion (Sh98 million) if he was in a rush to quit the label that created his musical stature. Mwijaku, in an interview, said Rayvanny was asked to pay the sum but was unable to. "From the information I got, recently Rayvanny got a partner from Zambia who wanted to invest in his Next Level record label," he said. "But the investor insisted that he has to be independent to avoid collision, and that means ditching Wasafi. "When he presented the case to Wasafi management, the managers there presented him with an invoice of TSh2 billion." Rayvanny has been missing in some of the label's big events like Zuchu's 'Mahaba Ndi Ndi Ndi' concert and Diamond's 'FOA EP' launch. While asked about the allegations during his ambassadorial endorsement event, Rayvanny said, "It’s normal when you are under a label for there to be disagreements on various issues. "There will come a time when Rayvanny will leave but for now, I am Wasafi for life." Diamond has not commented on the rumours.
