Nandi Senator Samson Cherargei has been detained at the Capitol Hill Police cells after the arrested and the road trip with police from Eldoret. The senator will be arraigned on Friday. A warrant of arrest was issued on him after he failed to appear in court in a hate speech case. According to police sources, a warrant of arrest had been issued against the Senator following the alleged disturbance he caused in the court earlier this month. Chief magistrate Wendy Micheni had asked the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti or Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to investigate the legislator’s conduct and whether it constitutes disturbance or obstruction of justice. The court made the directive after Cherargei made attempts to stall the trial by making numerous applications including asking Milimani chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo to recuse herself from the case. However, the senator has dismissed the allegations. In an interview on Thursday, the legislator said that he has lost count of the number of times he has been arrested. He, however, said he is glad that the illegal arrests, intimidation and blackmail will end in the next four months if Deputy President William Ruto wins the presidency. The Senator called his supporters to remain calm and peaceful saying the arrests are part of tribulations and challenges that some politicians will face ahead of the August 9 polls.
