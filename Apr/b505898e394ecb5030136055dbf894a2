Gospel singer Nicah the Queen and DJ Slahver have broken up a few weeks after they announced they were planning a wedding. Nicah wrote on Instagram: "People can fall in love and they can also fall out. All In all, we move on regardless! I wish him nothing but the best," she wrote. She had introduced Slahver as her man in October last year after keeping the relationship under wraps for some time. Slahver thanked fans for their concern. "I don't think I can say anything at the moment until both of us recover from whatever just happened. It is wise not to say anything while not in my right senses." He had earlier told Word Is he had already paid the dowry.
