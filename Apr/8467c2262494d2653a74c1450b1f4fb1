Eight years ago, the showbiz industry was thrown into mourning following the death of one of the great gospel musicians, Peter Kaberere. Kabere died after being electrocuted at his car wash. He was known for songs such as 'Mwanake', which he sang alongside Benachi and Kiburi. Celebrating his death anniversary, his wife Njesh sent out a message thanking God for him. "Continue singing with the angels. Thank you, God, for Your faithfulness," she wrote. The couple wedded on October 31, 2009, at the Rosebowl in Kitusuru. His death came as a shock and after many years, his music is still celebrated. He left behind a widow, Njeri Kaberere, and two kids. On his seventh anniversary, his wife said she is glad the heavens received a golden heart.
