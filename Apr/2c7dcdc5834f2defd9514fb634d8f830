Popular Vioja Mahakamani actor Gibson Gathu, who plays the prosecutor in the court drama, is appealing for financial help from Kenyans. He needs to get a kidney transplant. An appeal seen by Word Is says Gathu is set to undergo a kidney transplant at Mediheal Hospital in Eldoret. "Gibson has been managing diabetes for over 20 years now, but some time in November 2020 his kidneys failed hence he has been going for dialysis twice a week," the appeal reads. It says the condition has drained the family financially. The appeal says Gathu has a donor and needs between Sh5 million and Sh6 million for a kidney transplant. The process is scheduled for July 2022 at Mediheal Hospital, Eldoret. "The said amount is inclusive of post-surgery treatment for the recipient." A fundraiser has been scheduled for June 11 at City Hall, Nairobi, from 2pm.
