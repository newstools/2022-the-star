Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has accused  Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) Director general Ezra Chiloba of working with their political nemesis to their disadvantage ahead of the August 9, polls. His sentiments come in the wake CA directive requiring all unregistered mobile lines users in Kenya to register themselves by April 15 or be disconnected from service. Duale claimed that Chiloba is collecting data and working for the deep state to facilitate their win in the August 9, polls. "We are telling Chiloba we know you. Sooner or later we are going to monitor you. We know what you want to do on the polling day as far as the internet is concerned," he said. Duale was speaking during a Kenya Kwanza meeting on Saturday at a Karen hotel where Kenya Kwanza Alliance was signing a coalition agreement with National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi's Democratic Party. The former Majority leader further threatened to sue Safaricom in the event his line is disconnected. Chiloba directed that all SIM card users should register their SIM and warned that there will be no extension of the set deadline. "If you don't register, your SIM will be disconnected. Looking at the situation across the country, the compliance rate is not good at all which means the risks are even much higher," he said speaking at the KUZA awards.
