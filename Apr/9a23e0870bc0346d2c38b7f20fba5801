Deputy President William Ruto has expressed his happiness and satisfaction with the UDA primaries The UDA boss the exercise has been largely successful despite the logistical challenges and incidents of violence reported in some areas. "We have delivered at least 60 per cent what the IEBC does with one per cent budget of the IEBC," he told a press conference at the Hustler Center in Nairobi on Thursday evening. The DP said that he played a 'minimum' supervisory role in the countywide exercise that attracted about 5000 aspirants. "I assured UDA aspirants that I will take personal responsibility to ensure that the nominations are democratic and credible," he said. He, however, took issue with the violent incidences reported in some areas, saying the party will take stern action against those involved. Ruto disclosed that the voting did not take place in between 100 and 200 polling stations out of the over 16000 stations due to chaos and other logistical challenges. He added part of the challenges the party faces and largely contributed to delays in opening some polling stations was the shortage of fuel that has rocked the country. The DP said that the party's election board has pushed to Tuesday next week's elections in all areas where the exercise did not take place. This is to give Board sufficient time to procure election materials. The party postponed elections in at least 10 constituencies after they were marred by violence or election materials arrived late. "I am a very proud member of UDA. We have demonstrated that it is possible for a party as young as UDA to deliver a credible, believable and democratic election," he said. The DP attributed the high number of aspirants and a huge turnout of voters in today's exercise to the party's beliefs and economic agenda to transform the country
