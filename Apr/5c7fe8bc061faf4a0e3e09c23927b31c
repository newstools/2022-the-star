A few weeks ago, socialite Amber Ray moved on from a new man, a Sierra Leone basketballer identified as Kabba. Their relationship did not last three months, and Kabba stopped posting her photos on social media. To confirm she had separated from Kabba, Amber shared cryptic messages on her socials. In one post, she insisted on women having their own money. In a live session with SPM Buzz, Kabba confirmed he ended the relationship, saying he was trying to build a different thing from what she was building. "I still love her but everyone has moved on. I did not take time to know who amber Ray was. She was always telling me not to listen to what I hear about her or read about her." Kabba said they had met in Mialle restaurant.
