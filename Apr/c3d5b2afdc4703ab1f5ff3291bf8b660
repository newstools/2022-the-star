ODM leader Raila Odinga lamented that there were plans to kill him and his team after the burial of Mzee Jackson Kibor in Uasin Gishu. Speaking on Sunday in Washington DC, Raila said the campaign period has been peaceful save for the incident where goons were hired to kill them. "Some goons were hired and they actually wanted to kill us," he said. He narrated that the attack was vicious and they were saved by police officers. "You saw what they did to our chopper," he added. In the said incident, a group of rowdy youth started pelting his chopper with stones upon arrival for Mzee Kibor's burial. The Azimio flagbearer said they slightly changed the arrival time and that is what saved them. "The goons had the plans in place. They knew at what time we would arrive and the type of transport we had planned on using," he said. Further, Raila said that Kenyans are expecting to have a peaceful campaign period and peaceful elections come August 9. "So far things have moved smoothly up to where we are," he added. Raila is currently on a one-week tour of the United States. He is expected to meet with various technology giants at Silicon Valley, San Francisco, with a vision to promote IT and technology relations between Kenya and the US if elected in August. On Monday, he is expected to hold meetings with key players from Corporate America. Raila is accompanied by three governors, seven MPs and a host of Azimio leaders. They include; National Assembly Minority Leader John Mbadi, MPs Richard Tongi (Nyaribari Chache), Memusi Kanchory (Kajiado Central), and Esther Passaris (Nairobi Woman Representative). Others are Homabay Town MP Opondo Kaluma, Homabay Senator Moses Kajwang’, Kathiani MP Robert Mbui and former Kenya Ambassador to the US Elkanah Odembo.
