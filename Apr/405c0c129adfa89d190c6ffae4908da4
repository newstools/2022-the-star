Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) coach Sammy Kiki says the porters will have to work hard to stop Ulinzi Warrior's experienced backcourt if they are to clinch a seventh Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) Premier League men's title. The porters will host Game One on Saturday and Game Two on Sunday at the Makande Welfare Hall in Mombasa. "If we stop their guards, we will have a good chance going into the series' remaining fixtures in Nairobi. This is a meeting of two of the greatest teams in the league. Playing at home, I believe we can match them," Kiki said. The improved display of Ken Wachira, Lennox Lewis, and Brian Shivachi will be key with Victor Odendo providing the experience. Kiki says they have trained well and are ready for the soldiers. "We have trained longer together this time and perfected our offense. The team chemistry is good and we aim to win here and fight for one more win in Nairobi," he said. On the other hand, Ulinzi coach William Balozi believes the two matches in Mombasa are winnable despite playing in front of an away crowd. "My game plan is to win both games in Mombasa. But even if I manage to take only one, I will be satisfied coming back to Nairobi. I am aware of the threats posed by KPA at home. But we managed to beat them twice in the regular season and I am confident we will prevail again," Balozi said. The soldiers will miss the services of star guard Eric Mutoro, who is serving a one-match ban but Balozi said he has worthy replacements. "We will miss Erico but I am not worried. Jose (Khaemba) is back and there is also Victor Bosire in the same position. Besides the two guards, James Mwangi and Ancette Wafula are also available for selection. We have trained well," he said. The nine-time champions are going for their third crown in a row. KBF competition secretary Joseph Amoko disclosed that the trophy presentation to all the medalists will be done on the final day.
