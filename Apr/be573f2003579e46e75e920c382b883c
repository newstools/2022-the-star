Socialite Amber Ray has never used witch-doctor charms to win over rich men in her life. She told Word Is at the launch of her music career that she can never change the perception people have of her. "That is a very personal and deep story to me, and one day I will speak," she said. "I don't want to be emotional right now. I don't need to go to any mganga to get a man. I mean, look at me." A fan had suggested that she gets something to help with her huge following. "Sometimes, people are just too much. You have to give them what they want to hear," she said. "The people that matter most in my life know me well."
