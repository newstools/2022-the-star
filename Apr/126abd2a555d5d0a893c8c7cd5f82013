Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists his side will not under-estimate Champions League semi-final opponents Villarreal. Last season’s Europa League winners, currently seventh in LaLiga, have beaten Juventus and Bayern Munich to get to the last four and Klopp is determined to make sure his side does not repeat the mistakes of those European giants. “There might have been a little advantage (for Villarreal) in the last two games, maybe Juve or Bayern underestimated them, but that will never happen to us,” said the Liverpool boss, who is looking to secure a place in his third final in five years.
