Controversial singer Chris Mosioma, aka Embarambamba, has released a song in honour of President Mwai Kibaki. The gospel singer known for his crazy antics told Word Is that he chose to celebrate Kenya's third president with a song since he did not get a chance to perform for him while he was alive. The artist revealed that though he would like to grace Kibaki's burial,  he was banned from performing in government functions. "The last time Uhuru came to Kisii, I was told to reduce my drama as they were afraid I would cause tension," he said. "Am just a cool person and I know how to handle myself. Given a chance, I will be very cool. I am in Kisii and I am not able to even come and view our President's body in Parliament," he said. A video of the song he composed for Kibaki is doing the rounds on social media. Embarambamba said the song, Tufanyeje, will officially be released on Thursday. In the video, Embarambamba is sitting on a maize field wearing a torn red suit. He then gets up and starts walking around asking, "Kifo umechukua Kibaki wapi [Death where have you taken Kibaki]?” In his typical fashion, Embarambamba then throws himself in a muddy puddle before climbing a tree while wailing. "Kibaki ohhh. Kibaki umeenda wapi? Umefuata Moi [Where have you gone, Kibaki? You have followed Moi]." Embarambamba said he will remember President Kibaki for enabling free education and giving Kenyans a new constitution. Embarambamba said he takes after his mother who used to perform for President Daniel Moi in Kisii. "I am very talented and I have been in the industry for 11 years." In a past interview, Embarambamba said he opted to do gospel music differently by incorporating theatrics. He thanked his wife for standing by him, saying she is the one who washes his muddy clothes after performances.
