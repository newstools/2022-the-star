The Ministry of Education has asked secondary schools heads to be lenient to parents as schools reopen next week. Early Learning and Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said school Principals should treat parents gently, as some may fail to raise the school fees. “There are some parents who may come with less money, there are parents who may not have any money, be lenient to them,” he said. Jwan also called on parents to agree with the school principals on how they intend to pay the school fees. The PS said the schools will reopen next week and that capitation money has already been released. This comes even as the Ministry of Education has urged parents and guardians to ensure their children are registered for the national examinations that will be held later this year. Registration of Grade Six, Standard 8 and Form Four candidates for the examinations will begin next week, April 27 and close on May 14. He also noted that registration is free.
