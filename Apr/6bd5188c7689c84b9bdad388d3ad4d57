Athletics Kenya is looking beyond World Under 20 Athletics Championships in Cali, Colombia where team Kenya is expected to defend their title following their triumph at the 2021 championships at Moi Stadium, Kasarani, Nairobi. Speaking during the visit at the Kapchorwa training camp, located at the All4Running school compound in Nandi County and hosted by former world 800m champion Janeth Jepkosgei, AK president Jack Tuwei said that the runners they are preparing now should run for the country at the 2028 Olympic Games. He said the young athletes, currently in 26 training camps across the country, will ascertain Kenya's future if well managed. “We want to select the best team at the World Under 20 national trials in our quest to defend the overall title. We want to encourage them by looking at the future, where we hope to see them compete at the 2028 Olympic Games," said tuwei. "As a people, we must ask ourselves; who is going to run at the 2028 Olympics and beyond? quipped Tuwei. “I want to assure everybody that whatever resources we have been given will be put to good use. That's why we have started these camps since a federation without a youth development programme cannot expect a good future.” Kenya won the overall title at the 2018 championships in Tampere, Finland and went ahead to defend it at home three years later witha record eight gold medals. “Defending the title is not as easy as it may look. As champions, were are aware that everybody is preparing to dethrone us. We must, therefore, work hard and ensure we have a good team,” added Tuwei. He added that holidays are the best times to prepare the young athletes although he wants them to continue with their programmes once back to school. “I want to thank the government for supporting this programme, which requires resources," he concluded.
