UDA has cancelled its primaries for Moiben MP position in Uasin Gishu county following protests by aspirants over anomalies. Benjamin Kibet who is the county deputy returning officer said the nominations would be repeated on Tuesday next week. He said the party would ensure it puts in place measures for a free and fair exercise. During the just concluded primaries the winner's certificate was erroneously given to an aspirants who came fourth during tallying. Police had to use teargas to disperse rowdy supporters who stormed the constituency tallying at TAC center in Eldoret. "The repeat will only be for the MP seat and not any other," said Kibet. He was with area party county coordinator Paul Kiprop. Kibet said the party was pleased with how the primaries were carried out in most areas. "The primaries have demonstrated that indeed UDA is the most popular and organised party in the county yet it's the youngest," Kibet said. More than 10 aspirants took part in the primaries for the MP position in Moiben. At the tallying there was confusion with two leading aspirants both claiming victory. Professional Phyllis Bartoo and former MP Joseph Lagat both claimed to have won the MP ticket for UDA in the area.
