Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga on Saturday narrated how he received phone calls asking him to rescind his Kibaki 'Tosha' declaration in the lead up to the 2002 general election. While eulogising the late former President Mwai Kibaki, Raila said that he stood firm on decisions because of his belief in Kibaki's ability. "When I went home, my wife had received so many phone calls from people saying that we had blundered. But I said there was no turning back," Raila Odinga. "In my view, Kibaki had the knowledge and experience that were needed for the revolution of the country," he added. The ODM boss revealed that he declared Kibaki Tosha at a critical time when the country was yearning for a regime change but the negotiations among the opposition leaders were taking so long. " I decided to take the debate to Wananchi and asked them, 'Si Kibaki Tosha?' and they started singing 'Yote Yawezekana bila Moi." He said that while the expectant crowd were getting impatient at Uhuru Park, negotiation at Serena Hotel were getting inordinately long and he decided to take the bull by its horn and declare Kibaki Tosha. Raila also visited the 2002 MoU that was implemented leading to the disintegration of Narc. He reiterated that some opportunists around Kibaki ensured that the MoU was not implemented. "There was a clique around Kibaki and they are the people who are responsible for the rejection of the MoU. I said it was not Kibaki. These were people around him," he said. Raila, who formed the grand coalition government with Kibaki after the 2007- 08 post election violence, eulogised Kibaki as a visionary and transformative leader who turnaround the fortunes of the country. He narrated how Kibaki steered the government to initiate maga projects including the Konza City, Thika Superhighway, Lapsset and special economic zones that put the county on the road to economic revolution.
