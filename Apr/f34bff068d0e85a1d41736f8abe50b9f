Muendo Jane Mutheu, the best 2021 KCSE candidate in Makueni, has attributed her good performance to her parents who coached her during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mutheu was a student at St Theresa Mbooni Girls High School. She scored a mean grade of A plain with 86.691 points. Education CS George Magoha said Mutheu was among the third best student nationally, in the under 16-year-old category. She thanked her teachers, parents and support staff who played a key role in making her excel. “My parents are teachers. My Dad teaches Physics and Mathematics while my Mum is a Chemistry and Maths teacher. They coached me through the subjects,” Mutheu said. “I am happy to become position three nationally. It's a dream come true because I surpassed my expectations of 84 points.” Mutheu said during the school break occasioned by Covid-19, her parents downloaded papers and ensured she went through them as they guided her. She wants to join the University of Nairobi to study Medicine as she aspires to become a paediatrician. Mutheu urged her peers to obey their parents for them to succeed even in life. “Sometimes you may think that parents give you a lot of pressure when they tell you not to do certain things. I realised they always want the best for their children,” she said. “Do everything positively, and you will always emerge victorious.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
