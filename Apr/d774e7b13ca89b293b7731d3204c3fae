President Uhuru Kenyatta and deputy president William Ruto have arrived at parliament buildings where the body of retired President Mwai Kibaki is lying in state. Uhuru's arrival was preceded by that of Ruto, who then received him alongside the two speakers of Parliament (Senate and National Assembly). The President and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta will lead the nation in paying tributes to the late President, as well as their last respects. The cortege left Lee Funeral Home at 07:05 am on Monday escorted by the family of the Third President and was conveyed to Parliament with the casket covered with the National Flag. The body will lie in state for the next three days (Monday to Wednesday). Kibaki's death was announced by President Kenyatta in a televised address from State House, Nairobi on Friday.
