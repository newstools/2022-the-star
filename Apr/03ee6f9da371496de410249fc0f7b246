Jason Momoa has shut down rumours that he is dating Kate Beckinsale. The Aquaman actor was photographed giving the Underworld actress his coat and "acting flirty" at an Oscars after-party in late March leading many to speculate if they were dating. Jason shut down the rumours when he spoke to Extra at the Los Angeles premiere of Ambulance on Monday insisting that he gave the British actress his coat because she was cold. "It was cray (crazy). Have a conversation with a woman about her country, I was in England doing Aquaman 2. Everyone is like, 'Are you dating?' No, no, it was chivalry, the woman was cold," he said.
