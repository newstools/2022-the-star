Aspirants in Nyamira county are threatening to ditch ODM party if the primaries are not credible. The ODM nominations are scheduled for Thursday this week, with participants calling for free and fair nominations. In Nyamira’s Bonyamatuta ward, the race to clinch the ODM ticket is between two aspirants-Douglas Mokaya and Julius Matwere. On Tuesday, supporters of Mokaya took to Kebirigo town to demonstrate against an alleged plan to award a direct ticket to Matwere. Mokaya said ODM members should be given the opportunity to conduct free and fair nominations. “We are the owners of ODM, we must be given the opportunity to participate in a fair exercise to allow our members to choose their leaders without favour, if that does not happen, we will decamp,” Mokaya said. Nyamira county ODM chairman Richard Kaka, however, disputed the claims and said the nominations will be free and fair. “We have nominations on Thursday and as a party we have always conducted our nominations in a decent manner, so there is no need for panic,” Kaka said.
