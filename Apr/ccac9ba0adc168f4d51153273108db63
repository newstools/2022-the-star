The British government will launch an in-depth review of women’s football this summer with the aim of achieving greater parity with the men’s game, sports minister Nigel Huddleston said. British media reported that the review will be independently chaired and supported by an expert advisory panel. It will aim at developing the women’s game at the elite and grassroots levels and also look at commercialisation, spectator support and media interest. It follows the Fan Led Review of Football Governance, published in November by Conservative lawmaker Tracey Crouch, which recommended a review of the women’s game. “Women’s football is a growing force,” Huddleston said in a statement published in British media on Saturday. “Despite these positive signs for the game, it is clear that an assessment of the value of the women’s and girl’s game is needed, to ensure it is properly financed for the long term. “The time is right for a thorough review of the women’s game to ensure all is being done to support its further growth.” England is due to host the Women’s European Championship in July, with tickets for England’s group matches and final at Wembley all sold out. “This new review will support the continued growth and development in women’s and girls’ football and it will also help to create a great legacy following what promises to be a fantastic summer of women’s football as we host the UEFA Euro 2022 tournament,” a spokesperson for the Football Association said. The findings of the review are expected to be published by the end of the year.
