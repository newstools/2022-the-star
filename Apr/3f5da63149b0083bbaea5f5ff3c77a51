Comedian Eric Omondi has urged the new MCSK boss Ezekiel Mutua to establish a music awards show. He said Mutua has been given a second chance to absolve himself. Through his Instagram account, he said there is a way to bring back the lost faith of artistes in MCSK. Eric urged Mutua to establish music awards that will recognise and award best-performing Kenyan artistes. The comedian added that Mutua should prove to Kenyans he is able and can give solutions to the problems the Kenyan music industry is facing. "Inject money back into the industry. This will help bring back life into the industry, which is currently lacking. July 2nd, 2022, is my proposed date. Kazi kwako!" Willy Paul disagreed with Eric, saying artistes should just be given their money.
