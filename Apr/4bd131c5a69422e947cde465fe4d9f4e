Spain has taken another step on Wednesday toward a sense of normality amid the pandemic by partially ending the use of masks indoors. Spain had stopped the mandatory wearing of masks outdoors in February, however, a significant number of Spaniards choose to wear masks in crowded places. However, use of masks in all forms of public transport is mandatory, but not in stations and airports. Passengers on flight to Spain will be required to wear masks. Masks will be mandatory for visitors and staff in medical centers and nursing homes, but patients can choose to wear them or not. In workplaces, it is the employer who will decide whether the staff should continue wearing masks although the general rule is that face coverings are no longer mandatory. “We are not dropping our guard,” Spain’s Health Minister Carolina Darias said during an interview with El Pais. Spain joins other countries like US and Israel over the ban of mask indoors.
