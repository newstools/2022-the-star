Learners in secondary schools can now access revision materials at a subsidized price via mobile or computers. Zeraki, a digital learning platform has partnered with Safaricom making available a subscription of Sh20 per day. The amount can be deducted from either airtime or Mpesa and is available on the My Safaricom application. Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said in a press release that the investments in education are meant to address current gaps and boost youth employability. “Through the partnership with Zeraki we want to ensure that the platform makes digital education accessible and affordable,” Ndegwa said. The platform Chief Operations Officer Eric Oude said it will be accessible even to learners in far-flung areas with the Safaricom provision. Oude added that the application has been free since the onset of Covid-19 to allow learners access to the subjects. “With time, like after a year we will now start charging to access the app, you will have to pay a certain amount of subscription fee,” Oude said. The digital platform has two applications, one is learner-centred while the other one Zeraki Analytics is administration-centred. Zeraki Analytics allows teachers to upload and check assignments while parents can view the results of learners. The platform has a system for compiling and analyzing students' data. This is by an interface that provides results analysis, marks entry and bulk messaging to parents. For teachers, the results received from Zeraki analytics allow them to analyze and visualize results. In the country, 30 secondary schools are already using the platform to access digital learning.
