The Grammy award winning R&B artist Ashanti has been honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her mother Tina Douglas said she'd bought a fake souvenir star for her daughter 20 years ago, saying she would 'get one of these one day'. Ashanti's first album secured her a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for fastest-selling female debut album. A song from her second album, Rock Wit U (Awww Baby) has recently been sampled by British rapper Aitch on his single Baby.
