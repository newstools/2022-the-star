Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has slammed Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali over remarks that ODM leader Raila Odinga is old and unfit to lead the nation. Speaking at St Matthews Mwitito Primary School in Mumias East during a burial on Saturday, Oparanya said he is firmly behind Raila’s presidential bid, and he will ensure he ascends to power after the August polls. He said Raila is experienced enough to lead the nation, adding that President Robert Mugambe led Zimbabwe until his 90s. “Raila is only 77 years [old] and ready to lead the nation through the Azimio la Umoja brigade,” Oparanya said. “I am Raila's strong agent in this region. I won't allow a few people to taint his name,” Oparanya said. The former Council of Governors chairman urged politicians to maintain peace and spread messages of peace during their rallies as elections will only last for a day. “There will be life after elections. There is a need to maintain peace and be your brother’s keeper. We will need one another after elections,” he said. Speaking at the same function, MP Washiali urged Western region residents to rally behind Deputy President Willima Ruto’s presidential bid saying it's only him who has the agenda to change the country. “As Kenya Kwanza, we have moved across the entire country and tested the waters and I want to assure you that Ruto will win early in the morning,” Washiali said. The legislator also urged the Kakamega county government to help Mumias East build a health facility that will ease access to healthcare services to the residents.   Edited by SKanyara
