Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday evening hosted the Muslim community at his Karen residence home for an Iftar dinner. A number of leaders from the Muslim community attended the event, including the Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders. However, photos of the DP and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka emerged as the event went down. Some social media users claimed that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was part of the leaders who attended the event. The fact-checker has verified that while the images are not manipulated, they are not of Wednesday’s event. The photos were taken during a similar event that happened on June 13, 2018, in Nairobi. Former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko hosted the event that attracted a number of leaders including the DP and Kalonzo. At the moment, Kalonzo and the DP are on opposite political divides and it is unlikely that he will grace such functions at the DP's residence. Ruto is leading the Kenya Kwanza Alliance team, while Kalonzo is part of the team forming the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition Party, led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kalonzo is one of the leaders being tipped to be Raila's deputy. Therefore, the images that are being circulated are misleading and Kenyans should not fall prey.
