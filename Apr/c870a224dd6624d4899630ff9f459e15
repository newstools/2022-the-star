Popular on the Kenyan coast and in Tanzania, Mahamri is a form of fried bread (doughnut) that can be eaten as a snack, dessert or accompaniment to soups. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a large bowl, mix flour and margarine till it’s crumb-like. Add in the yeast, sugar, salt, cardamom, and desiccated coconut. Combine well. Step 2 Once combined, mix hot water and cold buttermilk. This is to activate the yeast. Step 3 Knead till it is soft and firm into a ball. Step 4 Transfer into a clean bowl then cover with a wet cloth and let it rise for an hour. Step 5 Knead again for 7 -10 minutes and roll out using a rolling pin. Step 6 Cut the dough into desired shapes. Then fry in hot oil till it is golden brown. Step 7 Wait for it to cool before serving with hot masala tea or cold milk.
