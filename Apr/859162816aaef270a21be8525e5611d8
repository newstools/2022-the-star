The United Democratic Alliance party Disputes Resolution Committee has announced the nullification of the much-contested primaries in Naivasha Constituency, Nakuru County. In a press address on Monday evening, the committee said that it has not handed over any party ticket to the aspirants, and they will be handed over after the complaints have been solved. According to the committee, a total of 115 complains were received, out of which 94 were received from the MCA nominations, of which 35 have been dismissed for being unmerited. "We have also conceded 24 of those complains and they were found to be merited, and the committee proceeded to nullify those results. We have also conceded four of them and the committee found that they were merited and proceeded to order for a recount." The committee received complains from 15 constituencies, and one of the complain has been dismissed for being unmeritorious. "Election results for one of the constituencies has been nullified, that is the constituency of Naivasha." Also, two complains in the position of the senator and governorship were filled, all being under consideration. "Most of them were heard late in the evening yesterday. They re still under consideration, and  the decision will be rendered by Thursday." Naivasha MP Jayne Kihara had disputed the outcome of the concluded nominations. The outspoken MP who stormed out of the tallying center lost by over 400 votes in an exercise that was marred by allegations of malpractices and bribery. Kihara garnered 9,991 votes against her predecessor John Kihagi who got 10,394 votes. At one time, Kihara and Kihagi clashed at the tallying hall over the ballot boxes that were brought in without seals. Kihara rejected the results noting that the ballot boxes had been tampered with before walking in a huff only for Kihagi to be announced the winner hours later.
