The government has tightened its border controls in efforts to heighten surveillance against terror threats. Director of immigration Alexander Muteshi says the directorate is strengthening border control committees to focus on those entering the country to curtail the entry of suspected terrorists or their networks into the country. “The directorate of immigration services affirms its commitment and support to multi-agency approach to threats,” he said. Muteshi spoke on Tuesday during the launch of inter-agency guideline on the fight against terrorism. “We are working with border management committees to ensure that we smoke out terrorists,” he added. The guideline seeks to bring together key players in the criminal justice system in a broad approach to flag suspected terrorists, their financiers, enablers and sympathizers. The immigration boss said his department believes that the inter-agency cooperation “is the panacea in fighting terrorism and its networks.” The launch of the guideline was officiated by CBK governor Patrick Njoroge. The governor said security in the banking sector would be enhanced to ensure that the country’s financial system is not used as conduit for funding terror activities. Muteshi said that given the unique security position of the country, all elements of national power should be involved in a coordinated manner to fight terror threats. “All the instruments of national power - economic, law enforcement, financial, information and intelligence should be geared towards winning this war,” he said.
