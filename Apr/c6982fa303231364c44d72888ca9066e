Police in Lamu seized Sh500,000 bhang after a boat chase and arrested a 35-year-old man. Feisal Hamadi was arrested on Thursday by Kenya Coast Guard Service officers on patrol. He and an accomplice had jumped out and escaped into a mangrove forest. Hamadi was seized later as he attempted to cross a channel. Police are pursuing the accomplice. On Friday, KCGS head of public affairs Kenneth Sabila confirmed the suspect was commanding the boat transporting bags of bhang. He was arrested at Tusitiri area at 4am. The boat was sailing from Matondoni area towards Lamu island when it was flagged by suspicious KCGS officers on routine patrol. “When the coxswain was flagged down, instead of stopping, he accelerated towards the Tusitiri channel where the two occupants jumped out. "They scampered into a mangrove thicket, leaving the boat behind. The officers impounded the vessel,” Sabila said. He said the bhang was found carefully concealed in khaki bags. “The suspect was arrested as he attempted to cross the channel after officers who were towing the boat stumbled upon him. He is being processed for arraignment,” he said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
