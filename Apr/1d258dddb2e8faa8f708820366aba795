Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has eulogised the late President Mwai Kibaki as a leader who led the country with humility. While eulogising the third president on Wednesday during the special sitting in the National Assembly, Duale said that he was able to serve under Kibaki as a minister, saying that Kibaki ensured that development projects were carried across the country. He said that the late president undergone hard times in his ruling during the grand coalition government,. The MP claimed that Deputy President William Ruto is the closest leader in the country with the leadership marching to that of Kibaki. "The next leader of Kenya must be like Kibaki. And the closest person to Kibaki is non other than DP William Ruto," duale said. He said that his argument is based on Ruto's manifesto in his August 9 presidential bid where he promised to ensure all Kenyans are involved in the economy. "William Ruto will like Kibaki, I have worked with him and he will turn our economy." Duale added that Kibaki was not a petty leader, as some of the people in the current politics. He said that Kibaki left the government when a loaf of bread was at Sh20, which is currently being sold at Sh55. “When Kibaki left, a loaf of bread was Sh20, today Kenyans are buying a loaf of bread for Sh55.” The MPs were recalled from recess to pay tribute to Kibaki as the country continue to observe a week of mourning. Members of the public have until Wednesday 4.45pm to see the body of Kibaki which is lying in parliament before being taken back to the Lee Funeral Home. Kibaki's farewell mass will be held on Friday at Nyayo Stadium ahead of his final journey in Othaya, Nyeri on Saturday.
