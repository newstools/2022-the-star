After winning the newest plagiarism suit that was brought against him, Ed Sheeran revealed he recently started filming all of his songwriting sessions. Sheeran says these measures are to quell any future claims of plagiarism. In 2017, after settling out of court over copyright claims for his hit song, "Photograph," Sheeran says he couldn't perform the tune for a long time. "I just stopped playing it." Ed Sheeran said via Daily Mail. "I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty." He says his continued fights over copyrights have made him alter his approach to songwriting.
