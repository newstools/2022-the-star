Eight parties on Tuesday officially joined Deputy President William Ruto-led Kenya kwanza Alliance coalition. They include Chama Cha Kazi (CCK), Communist Party of Kenya (CPK), Devolution Party of Kenya(DPK) and Farmers Party. Others are the Economic Freedom Party (EFP), The Service Party (TSP), Umoja Maendeleo Party and Tujibebe Wakenya Party . They all joined the formation during the signing of the Coalition Agreement with Kenya Kwanza founding parties, UDA, ANC and Ford-Kenya. Ruto, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wentangula witnessed the occasion. Each of the parties will retain their distinct identities while supporting the Kenya Kwanza Alliance flag bearer in the presidential contest. Other parties which joined the formation earlier are the Democratic party and Safina. Politician and lawyer Kithure Kindiki said that no party was coerced into joining the coalition. “Every party signing today has had a draft prepared and consensually agreed. Nobody has been coerced to come and sign or intimidated ,”he stated. The event at Ngong Racecourse came just three days after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi formally joined the Kenya Kwanza Alliance team. Muturi, who is also the party leader of the Democratic Party signed a coalition agreement with the Alliance on Saturday. The Tujibebe Wakenya party leader William Kabogo had explained earlier that he left Jubilee because he was not given answers when he asked about the plans Azimio la Umoja had for the vote-rich Mt Kenya region should it win the August vote. On March 6, Kiunjuri said that The Service Party (TSP) was gauging the country’s two main coalitions and will make the right decision on which one they will align to after the polls.
