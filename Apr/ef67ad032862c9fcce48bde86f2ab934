Bungoma Deputy Governor Charles Ngome has said he will compete with other aspirants to clinch the senatorial seat on DAP-K party in the August polls. Before joining DAP-K, Ngome abandoned his boss and joined UDA in Kenya Kwanza alliance before returning to Azimio La Umoja movement. DAP-K is led by Wafula Wamunyinyi. Speaking in Webuye East on Monday, Ngome said he ditched the Kenya Kwanza because he didn't want to work with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. Ngome said for Bungoma to move ahead and develop like any other counties in Kenya, it needs a senator and a governor who work together towards a common goal. "I have worked with Wangamati for five years and I have decided to move on and vie for this senatorial position in DAP-K that my boss is also part of," Ngome said. He further said if Wangamati is to be praised for the good job he has done then he (Ngome) is also part of it, adding that Wangamati has faced a lot of opposition from Senator Wetang'ula because of their political differences. Governor Wangamati is expected to pick another running mate who will support him recapture the seat. Wangamati and his deputy were given direct nomination tickets on DAP-K to run for the positions.
