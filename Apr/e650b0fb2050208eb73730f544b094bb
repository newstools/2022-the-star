Kenya Meteorological Department has predicted that the country will receive rainfall in its seven-day weather forecast. According to the weatherman, rainfall is expected over the Highlands East of the Rift Valley, the Coast, the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central and South Rift Valley, the South-eastern lowlands, North-western and North-eastern Kenya. During the period, both daytime (maximum) temperatures, and nighttime (minimum) temperatures are likely to be moderate. In North-western Kenya, the morning rains as well as afternoon and night showers,  and thunderstorms are likely to occur in a few places. The Highlands East of the Rift Valley including Nairobi will receive temperatures ranging from 25oC to 30oC while minimum(night-time) temperatures are expected to be between 06oC and 18oC. Occasional morning rains are likely to occur in a few places, and afternoon and night showers and thunderstorms are expected over a few places occasionally spreading to several places. The seven-day forecast period will run from Tuesday, April 12 to 18. In its last prediction, the weatherman said that most parts of the country were generally sunny and dry. Their forecast comes in the wake of criticism over the reliability of their predictions. Last week, Senators launched a probe into unreliable weather forecasts by the MET. Legislators want to establish whether the department’s undependable weather prediction is a consequence of the use of obsolete technology. The Standing Committee on Land, Environment and Natural Resources want the department to elaborate on the type and age of the equipment being used to capture weather information for forecasting and the period it has been in use.
