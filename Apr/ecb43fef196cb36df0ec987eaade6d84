At least nine people were Friday killed while four others injured when suspected cattle rustlers struck in Isiolo County's LMD area. The deceased were shot after the gunmen believed to be from neighbouring Samburu struck at midday. Police and witnesses said the deceased were herding their camels at the time of the attack. Police said eight people died on the spot while the ninth died in hospital. Four others are in hospital in stable condition. Tension is building up in the area following the attack with the majority of the area residents fleeing for safety. More security agents were sent to the area to pursue the gunmen who escaped with animals after the attack. It is the latest such incident to happen in the area amid fears of retaliation which may turn tragic. The government has been promising action on the trend. Last week, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi told National Assembly Committee on National Security and Administration of Justice that currently, 25 per cent of National Government security resources are committed to securing the area and Laikipia, Samburu and Baringo counties. He said special units of security agencies embedded with police deployed to the counties and that the situation is aggravated by politics of expansionism, drought, rough and vast terrain and proliferation of arms sneaked in through porous borders. “Political instability and troubles in neighbouring countries further make it easy to access weapons. Perpetuation of retrogressive practices such as cattle rustling and moranism worsening the conflict,” he said. He said the government is also investing in infrastructures such as roads and water pans/dams to open up the region and encourage more settlements. “Investments in education, agriculture, health and social amenities also being upscaled as a long term solution.”
