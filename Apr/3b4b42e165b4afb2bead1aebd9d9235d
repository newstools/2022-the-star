Detectives based in Juja are hunting down three suspects who killed a 23-year-old university student in cold blood on Tuesday night before escaping with his phone and other valuables. DCI reported that Joel Juma, a fourth-year Industrial Chemistry student at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), was stabbed two times in the chest before the suspects fled into darkness at 2 am. Juma’s girlfriend who is a Law student at the Mount Kenya University, Parklands Campus, said she had escorted her boyfriend to get some revision materials from his classmates a few blocks away when they were attacked. "It is while on their way when the thugs attacked them near hotel Lilies, demanding money and mobile phones," DCI said. DCI added that two of the suspects descended on Juma with blows and kicks before stabbing him twice on the left side of his chest, leaving him lying on the ground in a pool of blood. "The third assailant manhandled the lady who had not carried any valuable and luckily left her unscathed," DCI added. Local guards heard the commotion and rushed to the scene where they helped Juma get to a local dispensary but he was pronounced dead on arrival. Detectives have since established that pockets of a notorious gang, which escaped the ongoing operation to rid Kayole and Dandora of criminals, have found a safe haven in Gachororo where they are regrouping with the aim of establishing a territory. Consequently, a major undercover operation to completely annihilate the gang has been launched in the area.
