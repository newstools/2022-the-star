Ulinzi Starlets take on Vihiga Queens on Sunday in Kenya Women's Premier League title decider at the Mumias Complex. Leaders Vihiga have opened a nine-point gap (34) against Ulinzi's (25) but the Diana Shakava-captained Ulinzi have a chance to narrow the gap to six points and throw the title race open should they win with nine games left. On the other hand, a win for Vihiga put them steadily on course for their fourth title in five years. Ulinzi coach Joseph Mwanza has vowed to make life difficult for their opponents after losing 2-0 in the reverse fixture at Utalii grounds. "It's a do-or-die match for us. There are no shortcuts. We must win at Mumias to remain in the contention failure to which the race will be over. All our hopes are pinned on this match," he remarked. He added: "Losing means the gap could be 12 points depending on other results and the gap will be hard to bridge. The players have come of age since we lost to the leaders a few months ago and this will be a different ball game altogether." Mwanza said Ulinzi have a fully fit squad but handling pressure in the early stages of the match will be crucial. "We have been in this situation before so we have to manage the game quite well. New players have finally settled in and the squad looks complete." Third-placed Gaspo face off Kayole Starlets at Stima Club as Kisumu All Starlets host Zetech Sparks at Moi Stadium, Kisumu.
