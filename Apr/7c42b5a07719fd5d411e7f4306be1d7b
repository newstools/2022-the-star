Preparations for the second edition of Machakos 15km Great Road Run have started ahead of the July 30th meeting. Race director, Philip Makau Muia, said the early preps will help them manage the big field that is expected for the event. "We want to ensure we stage a good event this time around," Makau noted.  He said their theme is “Run For Peace’ with the country's general elections set for  August 9. “We expect huge entries and to handle them, we need to start early. We expect athletes from all over the country," he explained. Victor Kipchirchir won the inaugural event at the Machakos People’s Park, Muia last year while Emmanuel Bor 42.04.86, who defended his Eldoret City Marathon title last weekend, was placed second in the Machakos race. "We expect last year's winners to grace the event. We also expect to seal a number of sponsorships soon," he said. Muia said the route will be the same with runners featuring in 15km elite Open Classic, 10km Talent Discovery race, and 3km Fun and children race. Winners in the 15km classic will pocket Sh 100,000 with prizes trickling down to the top 15. Registration will start soon in all major regions including Iten, Ngong, Eldoret, Kisumu, and Nairobi.
