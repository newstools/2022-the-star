Murang'a woman representative aspirant Flasiah Muthoni has accused Usawa Kwa Wote party of shortchanging her and issuing the party ticket to her rival, Isabella Njeri. Muthoni said she had joined the party months ago and had invested in it. She said Njeri only announced her bid recently. The aspirant disputed the nomination process used by the party. “We were told we would not be nominated through universal suffrage and we were instead interviewed,” Muthoni said. She said the party took too long to announce the awardee and when she enquired, Muthoni was told the ticket had been issued to Njeri. She now wants the officials to re-conduct the consensus talks. “Should they not repeat the process, I will find ways of ensuring I get to the ballot and the party will have to return the Sh75,000 nomination fees that I paid,” she said. Addressing journalists in Murang’a on Monday, Muthoni said her campaigns popularised the party and accused officials of not giving her reasons why she was not nominated. The party led by Governor Mwangi wa Iria is fielding candidates in all positions in most counties in the Central region. Muthoni joins other disgruntled aspirants who have been complaining after missing out on party tickets. Political analyst Peter Kagwanja who was vying for the senate seat through the Jubilee Party shelved his bid after the party awarded the ticket to his rival Kembi Gitura. In Kangema, the party is still arbitrating between incumbent Muturi Kigano, a staunch supporter of the Jubilee and the chairperson of the Justice and Legal Affairs committee George Kibuku. Kibuku had initially been awarded the ticket but Kigano complained to the party, causing an impasse.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
