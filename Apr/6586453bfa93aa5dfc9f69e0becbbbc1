President Uhuru Kenyatta has constituted a National Funeral Steering Committee that will handle the process of the late President Mwai Kibaki’s state funeral. The committee is featuring representatives from the government, and members of the late president Kibaki’s family. In a statement, Head of the Public Service Joseph Kinyua said the committee will convene on Saturday for its inaugural meeting, and will in due course issue a detailed programme of the events leading up to the State Funeral. That programme of events shall include the dates, and venues where the family shall receive visitors, and shall accord all Kenyans the opportunity to participate in paying of last respects to the former Head of State and Government. The president has also said that the family of the late Kibaki has acknowledged the outpouring of sympathy and the condolences messages issued from all corners of the globe. “During this period of mourning and grief, the family is finding strength in the goodwill, thoughts, and prayers of all those who grieve the passing away of Kenya’s Third President.”
