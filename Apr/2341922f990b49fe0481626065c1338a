The National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) has issued an alert warning motorists of scammers purporting offer driving licence services. The authority has distanced itself from four social media pages offering fake driving licence services. "The public is advised to be aware of the following pages purporting to offer NTSA services," NTSA said. Further, NTSA requested members of the public who have been conned through the pages to report to the nearest police station. The development comes amidst a clash between NTSA and driving schools over the continued closure of the authority’s portal. Kenya Driving Schools Association (KDSA) national vice chair John Magara noted that many students have completed their learning but cannot be examined because the NTSA portal is dysfunctional. The hitch has affected about 1.5 million students in over 700 driving schools. However, NTSA emphasised that the portal was closed because of the court order resulting from the suit that was filed by KDSA. KDSA filed a petition in 2020 to quash the Traffic Driving School Instructor and License Rules 2020 on grounds that the rules had not been subjected to public participation. In a statement, the authority’s communications office said the court held that there was public participation and hence declined to quash the rules.
