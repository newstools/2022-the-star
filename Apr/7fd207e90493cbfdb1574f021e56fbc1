Liverpool took a commanding 2-0 advantage after leg-one of their Champions League semi-final against Villarreal, keeping their hopes alive of winning four season trophies. In the league, the Reds are currently one point off leaders Manchester City, signaling that the title race could very well go down to the wire. The Reds are essentially the only English team still in contention for all four trophies, and manager Jurgen Klopp admitted it was special. Klopp's team has three more chances to lift silverware through May having already clinched the League Cup (Carabao Cup) on February 27. They now have their sights on the English Premier League, the UEFA Champions League and the FA Cup. Despite missing out on the services of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane for the duration of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, Liverpool have held their own rather well across all competitions. If they manage all four, they would be the first men's team in England to win the three major domestic trophies plus the European crown.
