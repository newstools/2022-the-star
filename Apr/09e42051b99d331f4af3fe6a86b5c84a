The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) on Thursday arrested Moses Munyi Joseph, a Superintendent in charge of Operations at Nairobi City County Investigations Department. The commission said that the suspect was arrested for soliciting a bribe of Sh500, 000. According to the commission, the arrest arose from investigations into a complaint that was received on April, 27, that the suspect demanded a bribe in order to offer security and protection to the complainant in respect to a parcel of land that is in dispute. Upon reporting to EACC, detectives investigated the matter, and conducted an operation leading to the arrest of the suspect while receiving part of the bribe amounting to Sh130, 000. The suspect was escorted to EACC headquarters where he is being processed in accordance with the law. This comes days after anti-corruption court ordered that a bank account belonging to a junior officer at Environment Ministry be frozen after a Sh75 million deposit. According to the court documents seen by the Star on Tuesday, Samuel Kariuki was earning a net salary of Sh32,000 to Sh42,000 but had over Sh75 million in his account. EACC had filed the case against Kariuki. In the affidavits, the case was certified urgent and an order was made that the respondent or his agents should not withdraw the money.
