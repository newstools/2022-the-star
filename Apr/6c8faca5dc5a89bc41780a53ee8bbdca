After a lorry transporting UDA party nomination materials to Embu was attacked and materials burnt, the deputy President William Ruto-led party dispatched its officials to the area to probe the matter. In a statement on Wednesday evening, UDA NEB chairperson Anthony Mwaura asked aspirants to respect the decisions of Returning Officers. "The board sends a strong message to any aspirant who causes chaos, plans to destroy nomination materials that they will be disqualified from the nominations immediately," Mwaura said. He said that regarding the Embu case, the party leadership has spoken to aspirants Norman Nyaga, Cicily Mbarire, and John Muchiri about the incident in a bid to restore calm. "The party has also immediately dispatched Hon Kipchumba Murkomen, Bernard Koros, and George Murugara to Embu to help deal with the situation." The chairperson added that the party is monitoring situations in Molo and Njoro constituencies, and warns aspirants of disqualification if they are found culpable of causing violence. Also, the board has asked aspirants to ignore propaganda that is being circulated on social media claiming that some aspirants have already been given nomination certificates. "The board categorically states and assures all aspirants that NO CERTIFICATES have been issued at all." According to the board, the first provisional certificates will be issued after counting, tallying, and verification of ballots is done by presiding officers and as witnessed by aspirants’ agents on April 14, 2022. "Therefore the video being circulated purporting to show aspirants with nomination certificates is fake and should be ignored and treated with the contempt it deserves." Further, NEB stated that there will be no nominations taking place for Member of Parliament positions in Kipipiri, IgembeSouth, and Mwea constituencies following alternative methods of nominations that were done.
