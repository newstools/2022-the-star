Baringo UDA nominees have pledge to put in place measures to fight persistent insecurity occasioned by frequent banditry. Led by Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, who won UDA senatorial ticket, they said they will prioritise security immediately they win the August 9 polls. “We must all unite as leaders of Baringo to bring  a lasting solution towards ending cases of killings and livestock theft,” Cheptumo said on Thursday. UDA woman representative aspirant Florence Jematia and governor flag bearer Benjamin Cheboi also called for united effort. “Our people need an urgent restoration of peace to embark development and salvage their dwindling economy” Cheboi said. Addressing the residents in Kabarnet town, the leaders said they will help push the next government to stop banditry. “I have learned about existence of banditry in Baringo since my childhood, this is serious and it is time we brought it to an end,” Cheptumo said. He said Deputy President William Ruto will be the right person to tackle banditry if he becomes president. Hundreds of people have lost lives, maimed, lost their livestock and thousands of families displaced in the volatile parts of Baringo North and Baringo South subcounties. Jematia said once she gets to the parliament she would like to be incorporated in the National Assembly security committee. “By the powers bestowed on me by my electorate, I will pass all the bills to help fight the menace of insecurity whether it means buying guns or engaging in peace talks,” she said. Earlier on Jematia had suggested installation of pay bill to purchase guns to be distributed residents to defend themselves. The utterance landed her in court where she was charged with incitement before she was released with on a Sh1 million bond and barred from addressing the public for a while. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
