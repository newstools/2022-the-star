KCB Chess Club will participate in the upcoming East Africa Open Tournament to be played from April 30 to May 3, in Mombasa. The regional tournament is an elite annual contest played by the highest-ranked East African players and usually attracts over 200 players competing in the open, ladies and juniors sections. This year's tournament has attracted over 250 players from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and South Sudan and where a prize purse of Sh300,000 awaits. However, junior players will win trophies and medals. Organised by the Kenya Chess Federation and the Lighthouse Chess Club, Kenya will be represented by players from various clubs including KCB, Nakuru, Lighthouse, Nairobi, Mombasa among others. The 2021 national champion Martin Njoroge exhibited confidence the event will provide a good opportunity for Kenyan players to gauge themselves against highly-rated players from across the region. “I am looking forward to the tournament and I'm buoyant about a good performance. I analysed my previous matches with my teammate Philip Singe and polished up my weak points to prepare for the busy calendar,” Njoroge said. The tournament will also serve as preparation for the National Chess League, which enters Round 5 next month. It will also provide a good launchpad for the zonal competition, which will be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia between May 1 and 10. Njoroge said he will have to cut short his participation in the East African competition to attend the zonal tournament. The zonal tournament is played by champions of the various leagues in different countries.
