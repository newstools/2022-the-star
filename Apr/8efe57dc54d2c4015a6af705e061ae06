Equity Bank Dumas will take on Strathmore University Blades on April 24 in a match to determine the third-placed team in the Premier League. According to Kenya  Basketball Federation (KBF) competitions secretary Joseph Amoko, the fixtures will involve the teams that lost in the play-off semi-finals in all categories. Dumas and Blades were both locked out in the semis after losing to Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and champions Ulinzi Warriors respectively. The delayed men's playoff finals series between the two giants tips off in Mombasa with Games One and Two next weekend before shifting to Nairobi. Also on the card is the women's classification match-up that will see Zetech University Sparks lock horns against Storms. The lower Division matches on schedule will start a day earlier with Moi Aire Base (MAB) taking on Neosasa Morans. In the women's tie, Kenya College of Accountancy (KCA) University play Footprints as KDF Morans meet Coastal Kings in Division One. In a related development, Nairobi Basketball Association (NBA) fixtures secretary, Caked Osewe said the 2022 season will also tip-off at the same time. "We had programmed our league to start last weekend but due to some logistical challenges, we moved it by two weeks," said Osewe. He said NBA will accommodate new teams from Makueni and Kiambu counties.
