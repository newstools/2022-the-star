The hashtag #JusticeForSheila is trending in Kenya following the recent murder of a non-binary lesbian in the country. According to LGBTQ organisations, Sheila Lumumba's body was discovered several days ago. It is also believed that they were raped. Members of the LGBTQ community and human rights organisations - including Kenya's Inend and Amnesty International - have condemned the murder and called on the authorities to investigate. According to Kenya's National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC), Sheila's case is not isolated as the group has documented increasing incidents of violence against members of the LGBTQ community, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021 the hashtags #JusticeForErica and #JusticeForJoash were trending following the murder of trans-woman activist Erica Chandra and LGBTQ activist Joash Mosoti: Gay sex is criminalised in Kenya, punishable with 14 years' imprisonment. Members of the country's LGBTQ community routinely face discrimination and stigma. Efforts to decriminalise gay sex were thwarted in 2019 when Kenya's high court of appeal upheld the existing law.
