The New Democrats Party has criticised individuals vandalising its aspirants' campaign materials and asked rivals to engage in issue-based politics. TND secretary general for Mt Kenya region Jimmy Mkenya termed a Sunday night incident as barbaric, where suspected hired goons destroyed Nyeri governor aspirant Thuo Mathenge’s billboard. Mkenya said the billboard near the Ministry of Works in Nyeri town was vandalised by one of Thuo’s opponents. “We suspect they were sent by someone and most likely one of our opponents. We have already reported the matter and it is under investigations,” he said, adding that he was hopeful that investigations will be concluded soon and action taken against those involved. This is not the first incident, he said. Thuo's campaign banner was recently also destroyed near Marua shopping centre. "It has become a trend where political opponents engage in the destruction of campaign materials and use threats to intimidate competitors whom they believe to be a threat to them," Mkenya said. He was referring to an incident Thuo reported to the police after receiving threats from people alleged to be supporters of one of his opponents. He asked other aspirants to conduct peaceful campaigns and stop misusing young people to destroy campaign materials. Some weeks ago, Tetu MP aspirant on UDA Anne Thumbi’s billboard was torn while another belonging to Nyeri Senator Ephraim Maina was brought down in a suspected vandalism case. (edited by Amol Awuor)
