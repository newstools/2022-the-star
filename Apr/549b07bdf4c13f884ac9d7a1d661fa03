National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani on Thursday proposed several measures for Kenya Airways to meet its restructuring costs. The move comes at a time when the airline faces severe cash-flow constraints following global lockdowns triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from putting in place a number of measures in the last two years to remain afloat, including downsizing its staff, the CS proposed a number of steps the airline should take in its bid to bounce back to profit. They include: Kenya Airways plays a major and catalytic role in the economic development of this country but since 2014, it has failed to record a profit. The losses have compounded the huge debts the airline took to buy a fleet of new Boeing planes, pushing it into negative equity territory. Its total assets are currently valued at Sh155.5 billion against a total liability (non-current and current liabilities) of Sh157.9 billion. KQ now depends on the government for a bailout. Last year, the National Treasury committed to bailing out the airline after shelving plans to nationalize it. According to a plan presented to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year, the exchequer said it was helping the airline source for reputable consultants to come up with a viable turnaround plan. The Kenyan government agreed to assume $827.4 million of KQ's debt and provide financial support in FY2022 and FY2023. In February, KQ said it will for the second time work with Seabury Consulting, a subsidiary of professional services giant Accenture to reorganize the company. The consultancy firm will spearhead Kenya Airways' debt restructuring, which is estimated to cost upwards of $1 billion.
