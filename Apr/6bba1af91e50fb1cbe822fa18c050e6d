We visit a micro-bakery in Linden, Johannesburg. Linden Loaves is a micro-bakery based in the heart of Linden, Johannesburg. It started during the lockdown and grew into a professional bakery. The bread is baked the same way bread's been made for centuries. Allowing natural fermentation to take place in the dough over many hours unlocks flavours and nutrients in a loaf that just can't be achieved otherwise.
