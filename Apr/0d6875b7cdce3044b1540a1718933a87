Two incumbent Kirinyaga County legislators chances of getting re-elected have gotten a boost after they emerged winners in Thursday's UDA party primaries. Gichugu's Gichimu Githinji and his Ndia counterpart George Kariuki took the lead after trouncing their competitors with wide margins. Gichimu vanquished his two competitors by garnering a total votes of 13,034 from all the five constituency wards. Those who had expressed interest in unseating the latter are Clement Munyua who came in second with a total of 5,853 votes and Njage Makanga who garnered 3,729 votes. Gichimu is set to face stiff competition from Jubilee front runners Justus Munene or his predecessor Njogu Barua. Speaking on Friday morning, Gichimu expressed gratitude to his supporters for standing with him in the polls. He said their spirited effort to put up an aggressive campaign played a critical role towards his victory. Expressing confidence in retaining his seat, the MP said he is ready to face his opponents on August 9. "We have spent the entire night in the constituency tallying centre here in Kianyaga town waiting for the compilation of the results. I'm grateful to my supporters for their willingness in sacrificing their time and patiently waiting for the results. Despite, the long hours we have clinched victory." Moving on, the MP said he will aggressively popularise DP William Ruto's presidential bid across the constituency as he campaigns for himself. He said he is confident Ruto shall emerge victorious in the upcoming elections. "UDA is the most popular party in Gichugu and the entire Kirinyaga county. I look forward to working with his administration after August 9 polls." Meanwhile, Ndia MP George Kariuki clinched the UDA ticket by garnering 12,112 votes. His competitor Muteti Murimi managed 4,647 votes. Edited by B. Oruta
