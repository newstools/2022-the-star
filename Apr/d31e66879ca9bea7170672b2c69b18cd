Tiktok has announced that it is testing a feature that will allow users to dislike individual comments on videos. TikTok says that the dislike option will not be visible to others. “We've started testing a way to let individuals identify comments they believe to be irrelevant or inappropriate,” they said. Currently, users have an option to report a comment for community guideline violations. “Alongside our work to proactively remove abusive and hateful content or behavior that violates our Community Guidelines, we also continue to explore new ways to help our community feel more in control over comments,” they said. The company says it is holding decisions on whether to roll out the feature in full in the coming weeks.
