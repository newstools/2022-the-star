Flamboyant city politician Mike Sonko will be seeking to succeed Hassan Joho as Mombasa’s second governor on a Wiper party ticket. This comes weeks after he decamped from Jubilee and joined the Wiper party. He is seeking to revive his political career following his impeachment. Sonko’s name was part of the list of six aspirants forwarded to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission by the Wiper Party for the candidates they have cleared to vie for political seats in various counties. Wiper's National Elections Board vice-Chair Agatha Solitei confirmed to Capital News FM on Monday that Sonko will face off with Kisauni Member of Parliament Ali Mbogo in the primaries. “That’s the list we have forwarded to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, and yes Sonko has presented himself as a candidate in the Mombasa Governor race,” she said. Last week, former vice president Kalonzo Musyoka came out to defend Sonko, noting that the former Nairobi Governor cannot be denied a ticket since he has not been charged with a crime. “Sonko has not been charged with crimes against humanity. He was only impeached by the County Assembly of Nairobi and the decision was upheld by the Senate," he argued then. On December 3, 2020, Sonko was impeached by 88 Nairobi MCAs. The matter later proceeded to the Senate on December 17, 2020, and the senators upheld the resolution to remove him from office Last month, Sonko went to the Supreme Court to challenge his ouster. This was after the Court of Appeal upheld a decision by the High court that he was legally impeached in 2020. The court also found that Senate gave Sonko an ear before concluding that he ought to leave the county's helm. But Sonko maintained that he was yet to exhaust all avenues of appeal and will be moving to the Supreme Court. Edited by Mercy Asamba
