Life has changed for the high flying Russian Roman Abramovich. Not only is he being forced to sell his beloved Chelsea football club, he's now reportedly asking friends for cash. Reports say Roman is struggling to pay his staff and is asking friends for loans of up to $1 million. Last month, his private jet was grounded in America, and last week he was poisoned. According to Forbes, the 55-year-old billionaire has lost an estimated $7.5 billion since Russia invaded Ukraine.
