Rubis Energy Kenya has been making headlines this week for all the wrong reasons. Rubis has been accused by the government of fuel hoarding amid shortages that have paralysed transportation across the country. Immediately after the government deported its CEO Jean-Christian Bergeron over the fuel shortage crisis, an image purporting to be his replacement was shared on social media. In the image, it was reported that Bergeron had been replaced by Former Nairobi deputy governor Polycarp Igathe. The post which had an image of Igathe and  NTV logo stated that it was breaking news. "Polycarp Igathe has been appointed Rubis Kenya CEO, replacing  Jean Bergeron who was deported over economic sabotage in ongoing  fuel crisis," read the post. The fact-checker has verified that the statement did not originate from Rubis nor was it posted by NTV as purported. All communication from Rubis are made through its official social media handle @RubisEnergyKenya and its official website Rubiskenya.com. According to Rubis handle, the last post made was on April 14, 2022 and was the company's position statement on the Rubis Energy Kenya measures to address fuel supply constraints in the country. NTV on Saturday dismissed the post and termed it as a Fake news alert noting that it did not originate from them "FAKE NEWS ALERT! Please be advised that the news circulating on social media alleging that Polycarp Igathe is the new Rubis CEO is Fake and didn't emanate from NTV Kenya,"NTV said. Igathe is currently making a quiet comeback into city politics, now seeking to become the next Governor of Nairobi under Jubilee Party. He is among  the four Jubilee aspirants  who have also been cleared by th party ahead of party nominations . Other aspirants include Nairobi  Governor Ann Kananu Businesswoman Agnes Kagure and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) Richard Ngatia.
