At least five people, including a Chief and an Assistant Chief, were Thursday killed by gunmen in Marsabit County. Twelve other people were missing following the incident. Loglogo Member of County Assembly Bernard Leakono is said to be among those missing, police said. Loglogo Senior Chief Kennedy Kongoman, Lokileleng'i Assistant Chief Keena Moga and the three other victims were on the pursuit of stolen cattle in Awaye area when they were ambushed by the attackers. Their bodies were found in two cars that had been abandoned on the road after the shooting. The attackers escaped soon after the incident and it is not clear if they left with those missing, Marsabit County Commissioner Paul Rotich said. Rotich said the 12 missing people were also part of the team that was pursuing the cattle. “Teams are combing there to pursue the attackers and trace the missing persons,” he said. The signs of the attack have been there as clans attack and counter attack each other leaving many dead and displaced. Locals said police lacked a helicopter to help in pursuing the attackers and respond to the scene. All police choppers are grounded and those belonging to other agencies are occupied exposing the security agencies to more dangers. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i had warned the government will launch an operation in the area to tame the incidents. He said the government is determined to find a solution for the crisis in parts of Marsabit, Laikipia, Samburu and Baringo counties. Tens of people have in the past months been killed in what is seen as a political game to control local resources. On February 22, President Uhuru Kenyatta gave Marsabit leaders two weeks to come up with a lasting solution to the communal conflicts that have bedevilled the county. However, the situation is yet to stabilise.
