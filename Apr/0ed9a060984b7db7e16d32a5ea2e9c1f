The reigning World Under-20 3,000m silver medalist Zena Jemutai is looking at racing in all the major championships this year. Jemutai, who is also Africa U-18 1,500m champion, has set her focus on improving on the silver medal she won during the World U-20 Championships in Nairobi ahead of the Cali showdown in Colombia. She also wants to compete at both World Championships in Eugene, USA, Commonwealth Games in Birmingham as well as Africa Games in Mauritius. Jemutai was speaking after finishing third at the Athletics Kenya (AK) North Rift Championships held at the Tambach Teachers Training College on Saturday. “I will try to compete in the four championships to gauge my strength as I prepare to venture into the senior cadre,” said Jemutai. However, the ambitious runner said her priority is the World U-20 Championships in Cali, Colombia. “I have the potential to compete against my agemates in the World U-20, where I want to improve on my medal,” she said. She finished 3rd in the 5,000m behind Uganda's Stella Chesang (16:08.03)and Maureen Chepkoech (16:17.08). In other races of the day, Abraham Longosiwa and Diana Chesang won the men's and women's 10,000m titles. Abraham is a brother to veteran athletes Thomas Longosiwa. He won the men’s 10,000m title in 29:33.9 ahead of Victor Somom (29:44.9) and Kelvin Kibiwott (29:55.2) during the Tambach event. In the women's race, Chesang, running in her home county won the title in 34:52.7 beating Shamila Kipsiror to second in 34.55.9 with Turkana’s Irene Kaile finishing third in 34:22.3.
