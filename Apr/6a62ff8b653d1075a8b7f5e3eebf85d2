There was drama at a Kilimani hotel on Saturday morning after a woman who was arrested for stealing an Ipad claimed that the man, who had accused her of stealing, had sodomized her. According to the Director of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti, the woman had entertained the foreign national only identified as Khan but she left with the man's Ipad. The Ipad was later recovered after security stopped the woman and searched her bag. "The middle-aged woman had been invited to room 131, by a foreigner- only identified as Khan- where they had a good time until early yesterday morning when the lady left the room," Kinoti said. "Immediately after she left the room, Khan realized that his iPad valued at around Sh92,000 was missing and alerted security to freeze the woman and ransack her handbag in search of the gadget." The hotel’s security alerted police officers based at Capitol Hill Police station, who immediately rushed to the establishment. The woman then alleged that Khan had given her the iPad, being payment for the services she had offered him all night since he had no cash money. According to DCI, she also told the officers that she intended to file a sodomy report against the foreigner since he had gone against the order of nature, contrary to her wishes. Both the woman and the foreign national were arrested and booked at Capitol Hill police station as police conduct further investigations.
