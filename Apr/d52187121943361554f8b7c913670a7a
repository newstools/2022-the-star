Matayos   Orange Democratic Movement party supporters now want the party to conduct primaries for the MP seat. The group opposed what they termed as the award of a direct nomination ticket to current Member of Parliament Geoffrey Odanga. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, the residents urged ODM to choose their candidate through universal suffrage. "Tunataka nominations. Wale wanatuchagulia viongozi wetu, sisi ndio tunachagua," Kumbembea Boniface, a resident said. Loosely translated to, "We want nominations. Those that are choosing leaders for us, we are the voters." They added that if they are not given a chance to have nominations, they will not vote. Further, they affirmed that they did not agree with the National Elections Board (NEB) to have their ODM candidate chosen. "We did not agree with NEB to have the nominations done in Nairobi. We demand nominations," the group said. "NEB cannot use a  poll that was done in early February to give a direct ticket to Odanga," they added. The ODM party primary nominations started on April 1 and are expected to be concluded on April 21. On  Tuesday, Kajiado County Governor Joseph Ole Lenku got a direct ODM ticket to defend his gubernatorial seat in the August 9, polls. On Wednesday, the exercise was held in Siaya County. Eala MP Oburu Oginga and Siaya Senator James Orengo have also been given direct tickets for the party. Homabay County is set to participate in the nomination exercise on Thursday, April 14.
