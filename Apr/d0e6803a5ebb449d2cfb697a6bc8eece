South Sudan is not prepared for elections at the end of the transitional period in February 2023, the UN peacekeeping mission in the country has said. The lack of logistical preparations and rampant insecurity in different parts of the country were the main issues that would undermine the electoral process, it added. Last year, President Salva Kiir announced that elections would be conducted at the end of the transitional period. But his main rival, First Vice-President Riek Machar, said elections could not be held until a series of conditions were met, including the formation of a unified army. Mr Kiir and Mr Machar reached a deal earlier this week on sharing posts in the command structure of the military. South Sudan has not held elections since its independence from Sudan in 2011.
