Biriyani is a popular south Asian dish that is made with Indian spices. It goes well with rice, meat, eggs, or even vegetables such as potatoes. Most biryani is mixed with a rice dish. Ingredients For the chicken marinade For the rice Preparation Step 1 Place the chicken in a large bowl with the yogurt, ginger, chili, cloves, lemon juice, garam masala, cardamom seeds, turmeric, and cumin. Leave for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight to marinate. Step 2 Rinse the rice well and leave to soak in a large bowl of water for 30 minutes. Step 3 Meanwhile, using the vegetable oil of choice, cook the onions until they are very soft and golden brown Remove from the pan and set aside. Step 4 Bring a large sufuria of water to a boil. Then season the water generously by adding 1 cinnamon stick, 2 cloves, 2 cardamom pods, and 1 bay leaf, then set aside to infuse for 30 minutes.
