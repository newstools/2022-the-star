Tanzanian artiste Harmonize has bought his ex-lover Kajala a new Ranger Rover with the hope she will take him back. Harmonize said he chose that Range Rover model since it is Kajala's dream car. He added that he bought the car as a way to apologise to his ex but not to bribe her. "Even if it was Kajala 1 to 10, it cannot rub off the hurt I caused you and your family," he wrote. "It cannot be a reason enough for you to get back to me. This only goes to show how remorseful I am. All I am asking is for forgiveness from you." Harmonize went on to plead with Kajala to forgive him and give him one last chance. "I love you, please take me back." This comes just days after the artiste put up a billboard asking Kajala to forgive him. He had also bought her a necklace worth 250K. Harmonize and Kajala had dated in 2021 and broke up three months after he allegedly sent nude photos to her daughter Paula.
