Content creator Murugi Munyi, alias Yummy Mummy, is celebrating three months after she quit vaping. Vaping is the inhaling of a vapour created by an electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) or other vaping devices. E-cigarettes are battery-powered smoking devices. In a recent Q and A on Instagram, Yummy Mummy said she no longer craves vaping. "Once in a while, I get triggered when I am out and see someone's Insta stories. I've had to unfollow some people cause of it," she said. "But I am proud of myself for seeing this through. We keep pushing." She had earlier said her husband would hide the e-cigarettes when he came across them. "I just realised that today marks two months since I gave up vaping. I am so incredibly proud of myself. Two months nicotine-free after 1.5 years of what I now realise was a dependency," she wrote. The mother of three added that she would get upset when her husband would hide them. "I found a vape in one of Zach's (husband) drawers anytime I would leave my vape unattended. He would steal them and hide them away because he knew it wasn't good for me. It used to make me so mad but I realise now it was all love," she said. "Anyway, I didn't even flinch when I found it. I threw it away immediately." Treasury CS Ukur Yatani, while presenting the highlights of the Sh3.3 trillion budget last week, said the introduction of new products like e-cigarettes has led to addictions that are negatively affecting the health of citizens. "The design of these products and their taxation regime makes them easily accessible to users, including to school children and the youth, thus leading to nicotine addiction and consequently smoking and use of other drugs," he said. The CS announced high taxation to make them less accessible to school children and the youth. "In order to prevent these habits and make the liquid nicotine used in these devices less accessible to users, including to school children and the youth, I propose to change the taxation regime," he said.
