Eleven-year-old Ugenya High school surprised many during the release of the 2021 KCSE results. The school, located in Siaya County, posted a mean score of 9.05, an improvement from the previous year. In 2020, the school had a mean score of 7.56, an improvement of two points. When the school was started in 2011, they sat the first national examinations in 2014. School principal Clement Nyangacha attributed the success of the school to joint examinations. He said the students were subjected to full paper examinations that were done amongst several schools. Heads of departments in the school were also taken for benchmarking in other top-performing schools. “We printed t-shirts and wrote our target 9.0 and one hundred per cent transition to university, I am happy we achieved both targets,” Nyangacha told the Star. This year, all the 174 students from Ugenya High will get a direct entry to university after scoring C+ and above. “We thank our students for this exemplary performance together with our dedicated staff for making this dream come true,” he said. Even though they did not have an A plain, they had 8 students scoring A-minus, 42 scored B plus. Another 84 scored B plain, 31 got B minus and 9 students scored C plus. The school was started by Siaya Senator James Orengo in 2011 and had its first group of candidates in 2014. Orengo oversaw the construction of this school when he was the Ugenya Member of Parliament. A number of students from vulnerable families are sponsored by well-wishers and other education stakeholders. It started as a sub-county school and elevated to a county school in 2019. Two years later, the ministry certified the school’s rank to be made Extra County even though the process is still ongoing.
