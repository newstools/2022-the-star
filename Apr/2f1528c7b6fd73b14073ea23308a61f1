Mavoko MP Patrick Makau has dropped his Machakos gubernatorial bid in favor of former Chief Administrative Secretary Wavinya Ndeti. Speaking during a meeting led by Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Wavinya lauded Makau saying the decision he had made was 'heavy'. "For a brother to step down for a sister is not a joke." Ndeti urged members of the Wiper party to help each other in their political ambitions saying the journey needs unity. "Tutembee pamoja. Hakuna mtu anajiweza kwa hii safari (Let us walk together. No one can survive alone in this journey.)," she said. Wavinya, a former MP vied for the position in 2017 but lost to incumbent Alfred Mutua. Wavinya who received her nomination certificate will battle it out with former Machakos senator Johnstone Muthama who will be flying the United Democratic Alliance ticket. Others in the race include; former State House Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita and Deputy Governor Francis Maliti. Wavinya appealed to Azimio One Kenya Alliance leader Raila Odinga to pick Kalonzo Musyoka as his running mate. Her remarks were reiterated by Kitui County Senator Enoch Wambua, saying the position belongs to the former Vice President. "The Coalition cannot be managed by one person. Kalonzo should have been gazetted as the Deputy Party Leader of the Azimio - OKA Coalition Party, " he added. Edited by B. Oruta
