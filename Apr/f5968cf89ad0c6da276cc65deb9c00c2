Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi has won the United Democratic Alliance ticket in the county's governor race. He won in 10 out of the 12 sub-counties in Kiambu. The voter turnout in the county was low during the voting exercise on Thursday. Other nominees for the UDA ticket were former Governor Ferdinand Waititu and Eric Muturi. Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina Wa Jungle has disputed the results, stating that the UDA party favoured Wamatangi as he was close to top party officials. Addressing the media, he said that the exercise wasn't free and fair saying that in some stations, some of his agents were locked out of the counting exercise. "They have rigged me and I want to state it here that after two days, I will give my stand but I will be on the ballot," he said. He further said that his name Wajungle was omitted from the voting materials creating confusion. "People of Kiambu will vote for me due to my development record," he said. Earlier, there were claims that UDA had settled for Wamatangi, remarks that were dismissed by Wainaina. Wainaina had also said that he was willing to broker talks with his competitors for a deputy position.
