Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina, aka Wa Jungle, has dismissed the UDA primaries as a sham and said he will contest as an independent. He accused the nomination organisers of rigging him out by omitting his nickname 'Jungle' from the ballot papers. "I believed the process would be free and fair but I sensed trouble when the ballots came out with a distorted picture of me, minus the name Jungle by which I am known by all," he told journalists "I thought UDA was different from other parties and they would deliver a credible nomination but this was not the case." Wainaina lost to Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi. He addressed a press conference at the Kiambu Institute of Science and Technology county tallying centre. "I want to assure my supporters and the people of Kiambu in general that my name will be on the ballot. My record speaks for itself on matters of development and service delivery," Wainaina said. Wamatangi beat Wainaina by about 10,000 votes in the nominations held last Thursday. Former Governor Ferdinand Waititu came in a distant third. Wainaina said this was the second time he had been rigged out of party nominations. "Once bitten, twice shy. I was rigged out of the Jubilee nominations in 2017 despite having won and this becomes the second time. But I want to assure the people of Kiambu I am not quitting," he said. Wainaina said some of the glaring anomalies in the process included the appointment of polling officials aligned to his opponents and his agents being barred from some polling centres. Others in the race include incumbent James Nyoro, of Jubilee, former Governor William Kabogo of Tujibebe Wakenya Party, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria of Chama Cha Kazi, former Kiambu Woman Rep Ann Nyokabi, of Jubilee ticket, Dr Juliet Kimemia of Kanu, Mwende Gatabaki (independent) and Grace Mbugua (independent).
