The drought has pushed wild animals onto major roads in Naivasha, putting motorists at risk. The most affected are motorists using the Nairobi-Nakuru highway, Moi South Lake, North Lake and Naivasha-Kirima roads. In the last three months several motorists have been involved in accidents along the roads after hitting wild animals. David Kilo, an honorary game warden, identified Kihoto and Manera estates as the most affected. Hippos, buffaloes and zebras roam freely around the informal settlements at night. “The wild animals are passing through the flooded estates to the nearby Naivasha-Mai Mahiu and Moi South Lake roads in search of food,” he said. “Currently there is a scramble for pasture around the lake and this has made the animals, mainly buffaloes and hippos, very violent,” Kilo said. Friends of Lake Naivasha chairman Francis Muthui said fencing of several ranches along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway had contributed to the crisis. “The harsh weather has pushed wild animals from parks and ranches to roadsides, posing a major threat to motorists,” he said. Muthui said it was common for visitors to spot zebras, warthogs, baboons and even buffaloes on the highway. “There is an urgent need for KWS to work with nearby ranches and game sanctuaries to see how this menace will be addressed before we lose lives,” he said. Muthui said the majority of wildlife within Naivasha were outside Hell's Gate and Longonot national parks. “We have private ranches in Naivasha and Gilgil but they cannot handle the high number of animals and this has been worsened by the closure of various wildlife corridors,” he said. A senior KWS officer, who did not want to be named, said the problem was beyond their control as all the game parks in Naivasha were not fenced. “The biggest challenge we are currently facing is the drought which has pushed the wild animals into farms, but we hope this will change when we get the rains,” the officer said.
