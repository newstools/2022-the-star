A look back at the highlights from the weekend's Premier League action as Manchester City retain their one-point lead over Liverpool after both sides claimed wins. Gabriel Jesus struck four times as Manchester City crushed Watford 5-1 to chalk off another win in their battle with Liverpool for the Premier League title. Elsewhere, Liverpool beat Everton 2-0 to pile pressure on City. At one point, City's lead over Liverpool was at 14 points. But the title race is now wide open after City dropped points here and there and Liverpool went on an impressive streak, taking all three points in 11 of their last 12 league games. However, based on the Premier League table, Liverpool have a tougher run-in than City. Liverpool will have to play a top five side in Tottenham, and they have to face a desperate Everton side in a Merseyside derby. They will need to keep winning and hope Man City drop points along the way. The rest of Man City's league schedule, two home games and three away remaining, seems favorable in comparison to Liverpool's. The final three matches, however, come against complicated sides that have given real tests to opponents this season: Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa.
