Media personality Jalango's wife Amina Chao has opened a hotel called Wapek (heavy) Delicacies. Speaking to Mungai Eve, Jalang'o said his wife and her friends worked on the project. "I did contribute but I have been mostly her cheerleader," he said. "The hotel will be heavily selling traditional foods as most CBD's hotel sells Somali food and delicacies." Jalang'o said his wife is against alcohol being sold in the hotel given her Muslim upbringing. "I hope she will agree to let us sell alcohol because I enjoy my whisky," he said. "I built the place by 'force'. I lied that the area was set aside for people who come here to enjoy coffee. Alcohol has money and I am a business person."
