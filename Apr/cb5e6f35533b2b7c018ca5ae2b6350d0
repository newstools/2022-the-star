Former envoy Ken Vitisia and former MP Yusuf Chanzu have declared their bid to unseat incumbent Vihiga MP Ernest Kagesi in the August 9 polls. Chanzu will contest the seat on a UDA ticket while Vitisia is seeking it under ODM. Kagesi is in ANC. Chanzu said Kagesi has disappointed the people in terms of development and never achieved what he promised voters. “When I left the MP seat to contest for governor which I lost to Ottichilo, Kagesi promised Vihiga people heaven but he has done nothing,” Chanzu said. However, efforts to reach Kagesi to defend himself over the allegations failed as the lawmaker’s phone went unanswered. Vitisia said his vast experience as an ambassador will help him deliver development to the people if elected. The former envoy was speaking at Kidundu stadium during the ODM rally in Vihiga on Thursday. Already the four MCAs from Kagesi’s back yard have ditched ANC party and joined UDP saying the lawmaker is against them and is eyeing to cripple them politically. The four Victor Ijaika (Lugaga wa Muluma) Evince Chunguli (Central Maragoli) Elisha Amara (South Maragoli) and Ombajo Masini (Mungoma) in a joint statement said the MP is grooming their competitors to oust them. However efforts to reach Kagesi for a comment on the MCAs allegations also failed. In an interview Ijaika said the MP is fronting people who will not fight for the interests of  residents but to worship him. “The MP wants us out of the party and our people are not part of his agenda,” Ijaika said.
