President Uhuru Kenyatta has challenged leaders to emulate the late former President Mwai Kibaki with action and not just empty rhetoric. Speaking during the burial ceremony of the late President in Othaya, Nyeri county, Uhuru said that leaders should put into action the good attributes they said about Kibaki. "As Kenyans, let us not just say by word of mouth (good things about Kibaki). Let us do it by action. Let's emulate what we have learned from Mzee," the President said in his short speech. Mourners at the event had eulogised the late President as a visionary, astute, and distinguished economist who undertook his duties with passion and distinction. In his speech, Uhuru said that Kibaki was a hero and a great leader whose good deeds forever live in the memories of Kenyans. "Mwai Kibaki was the father of the nation and father of many people in our republic," he said. "We are here to send our hero to his resting place. The journey we had had with him has ended because he has rested we will continue working together with the family," he said. Uhuru assured the Kibaki family that he and the government will continue collaborating with them even after the burial of their father. "You are not standing alone. We are with you and will continue to be with you," he said The President thanked the Kibaki family and the residents of Othaya for giving the country a visionary leader who turned around its fortunes of the country.
