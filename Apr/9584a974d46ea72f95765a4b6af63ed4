Over 100 golfers are expected to take part in the 16th leg of the ‘Road to Gleneagles’ Johnnie Walker Golf Series at the par-72 Kakamega Golf Club on Saturday. The golfers will compete in the tournament’s four-ball Stableford format in the event that tees off at 7 am. The top three finishers will book their slots for the tournament’s semis dubbed the Eagle’s Round where they will be seeking to make it to the Grand Finale at Karen Country Club in May. The event follows the 15th leg of the series last weekend at Kiambu Golf Club. During the event, the quartet of Peter Kaburu, Henry Ruhohi, Peter Njuguna, and Lucy Gichimbiri, jointly scored a remarkable 119 points to clinch the event at Kiambu Golf Club. The team of Michael Karuga, George Kuria, Michael Karanja, and Alex Mukui hit a combined score of 110 points to claim the title. They carded three more than the team comprising Michael Karanga, Michael Nyangi, Caesar Mugo, and Ken Mwaura, who managed a total of 107 points to claim the third position.
