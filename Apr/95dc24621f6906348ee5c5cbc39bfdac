Headteachers meeting in Mombasa have revealed worrying trends of juvenile delinquency that, if not dealt with urgently, could see many generations waste away. Many students are abusing potent drugs, alcohol and other substances. The principals are blaming the Children Act, which made it difficult for teachers to discipline students. Understanding why students commit these crimes is as important as the solution itself, which is essential to preventing future crimes. Both parents and teachers need to address the issues that have led to the choices some children have made. It is even more important that these issues are addressed at an early age. Rehabilitation rather than incarceration is a popular solution to juvenile delinquency. According to researchers, the best way to deal with this issue is for the community to act together. Apart from spending time with and talking to children, there is overwhelming evidence that parents can greatly help fight the problem if they stay alert, encourage extra-curricular activities and hobbies and remain firm where needed. Parliament should also consider amending the Children Act if that will help fight the rot in our schools.
