Russia has stepped up its "mobilisation" campaign in the eastern Donbas region and started to draft men who are not eligible for conscription, the Ukraine's military intelligence service has said on the online messaging platform, Telegram. The agency said that employees of "strategic enterprises", who had previously been exempt from military service, were now being drafted. It noted that the Russians plan to mobilise about 1,700 employees of the Alchevsk steelworks alone, and workers responsible for maintaining power lines were no longer off the hook for military service. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate, several mobile brigades are operating in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic, where they stop men and issue them with a summons to come to a military enlistment office. Earlier, the UK's Ministry of Defence said in its latest public intelligence update that Russia was trying to boost troop numbers with personnel discharged since 2012.
