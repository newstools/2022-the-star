MCA aspirant Andrew Omwende emerged the winner in the concluded ODM primaries in Siaya's Sigomere ward. Omwende, who was born without legs and relies on a wheelchair, expressed confidence in clinching the seat on August 9. He garnered 1,018 votes to clinch the ODM ticket. The former sitting volleyball player in the national team has been active in politics since 2007 and used sports to win support. "I have dared to dream big despite living with a disability, I believe my main purpose on earth is to serve common people. This is my mission on earth and I believe I will achieve it," he said. Omwende made his first appearance in politics in 2007 when he contested the local council elections but recorded poor performance. "The first time I contested, I lost to my opponent and this gave me some valuable lessons that helped me win the Sigomere seat in 2013. Politics is not a bed of roses and even after you are elected there are many things that come with all the elective positions," he continued. He lost the seat in the 2017 elections to Odawa, who had won the ODM primaries. Omwende further said that his opponent became wiser than him in 2017 and it gave him a chance to re-strategise. ODM subsequently nominated him to represent people with disabilities. "I didn’t join politics for sympathy votes or to be considered for nomination. If that was the case, I would not be campaigning in the villages looking for votes,” he said. “I would instead be walking around with the party officials in order to earn nominations." Edited by B.
