Comedian Jasper Muthomi alias MC Jessy has said he is still in the race for the South Imenti Member of Parliamentary seat. He dismissed claims that he had stepped down from the race as earlier reported by UDA party leader William Ruto. Speaking to Citizen TV's mid-morning show, Muthomi said that DP Ruto and other party leaders planned a meeting to deliberate on who would fly the UDA flag but he did not know he was to be asked to shelve his MP ambitions. "I met them but we did not agree on stepping down," he said. "I talked to the DP and he asked me to drop my MP bid but later on, I called him and told him that Imenti people did not want me to support anyone else." Last week, the Deputy president announced that he held talks with the MP hopeful who had agreed to shelve his MP ambitions and support Kathaara. "MC Jessy (Jasper Muthomi) will join the presidential campaign team after postponing his parliamentary bid in favour of Mwiti Kathaara for the South Imenti Seat," Ruto tweeted. MC Jessy has now urged young politicians not to trust everyone, adding that he regrets attending the meeting. "Young people have a lot of work ahead of them, especially those of us who joined politics recently.  Do not trust everyone with your political plans." MC Jessy will vie for the parliamentary seat as an independent candidate.
