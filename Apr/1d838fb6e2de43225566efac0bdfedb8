Srilanka has urged Pakistan to expedite the pending financial assistance offered by the country amid a serious economic crisis. The proposed financial facilities include grant assistance of Pakistan Rs 5.2 crore for sports, a credit line of $10 million for procurement of defence equipment, a new defence credit facility worth $50 million and a credit line of $200 million for procurement of mutually agreed items. The proposal was made by Pakistan in February 2021 during the two-day official visit of former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to Colombo. Sri Lanka is battling a severe economic crisis with food and fuel scarcity affecting a large number of the people in the island nation resulting in massive protests over the government's handling of the situation. The economy has been in a free-fall since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, affecting tourism. Sri Lanka is also facing a foreign exchange shortage, which has affected its capacity to import food and fuel. The shortage of essential goods forced Sri Lanka to seek assistance from friendly countries. The economic situation has led to huge protests with demands for the resignation of prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
