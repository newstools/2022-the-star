Singer Willy Paul shaved his signature dreadlocks to do away with sin. The Toto hitmaker told Mungai Eve he wants to be a good person. "Kijana wa mungu. I decided to get rid of something that Delilah could see and come for," he said. "I have seen a lot, and I have been through a lot. So many things contributed to me shaving my hair." Last year, Pozze promised to create ‘clean and meaningful’ content. He apologised to his fans on Instagram, admitting that he released ‘dirty’ tracks to draw attention. Pozze then promised to be more intentional in his approach to content creation. "For the longest time, I thought that being nasty was the way to go. That being nasty would make my music sell," he said. "I’ve come to realise that good music is what people really want, and this year, I promise nothing but the best."
