The defence team representing lawyer Paul Gicheru who is under trial at the International Criminal Court has been ordered to table motions it seeks the chamber to rule on by Wednesday next week. The orders which are part of ‘Order Setting Deadline for Defence Requests’ were issued by presiding judge Miatta Maria Samba. “In the interests of ensuring the expeditiousness of the proceedings, the Chamber hereby instructs the defence to file any further motions upon which it wishes the Chamber to rule, by no later than May 4th, 2022,” reads the order in part. It further reads, “The Chamber understands the notice not to present ‘a case’ as the defence’s notification that it will not be presenting a case through the calling of witnesses. However, the Chamber interprets the Defence’s Bar Table Motion as that it still intends to tender evidence into the record.” In a statement dated April 25, from his counsel Michael G. Karnavas to the Trial Chamber III and the prosecution, Gicheru said he does not intend to present a case. Gicheru is facing offences against the administration of justice, consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses regarding cases involving Deputy President William Ruto and veteran radio presenter Joshua Arap Sang. Gicheru pleaded not guilty before presiding judge Miatta Maria Samba. The first appearance of Gicheru before the Court took place on November 6, 2020. The prosecution team concluded presenting its witnesses last month.
