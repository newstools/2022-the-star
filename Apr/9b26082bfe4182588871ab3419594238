Some 38,797 KCPE candidates have been selected to join national schools on May 3, 2022. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha says 214,960 others have been placed in extra county schools while 258,456 will be enrolled in county schools. Another 726,311 students will be enrolled in subcounty schools while 2,045 have been placed in special needs schools. Magoha said more than 800 students from informal settlements are among those selected to join national and extra county schools. He said their selection was based on affirmative action and was purely on merit. Overall, a total of 1,214,031 candidates sat the 2021 KCPE exam. Out of this number, 11,857 candidates scored between 400 and 500 marks. Another 315,275 scored between 300 and 399 marks. A further 578,197 scored between 200 and 299 marks. Usually, national schools can accommodate 29,712 students. Extra county schools can enroll 123,399 students, county schools 142,358, while sub-county schools can accommodate 685,590 learners. Private schools have a capacity of 69,880 students. There are 32 special needs secondary schools with a capacity of 1,453 students. Candidates who scored 380 marks and above are ordinarily assured of places in national and extra county schools. While releasing the results on Monday at the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, KICD, Nairobi, Magoha affirmed that all the 1.2 million students will get slots in secondary schools. He, however, noted that most students were not guided while selecting schools they would like to join in Form One. This, he noted, led to most national schools receiving overwhelming applications as the number of applicants surpassed available slots. A case in point is Sironga Girls High School in Nyamira County which will enroll more than 800 Form One students. Magoha urged the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to send more teachers to the school to match up the huge enrollment. He said the school will be forced to have around 17 Form One streams. Meanwhile, Magoha directed chiefs and sub chiefs to oversee construction of CBC classrooms and also ensure all students are enrolled in Form One. The CS further advised that bursary funds from the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) be spend on learners in boarding schools, saying the government pays the entire costs of day secondary schools.
