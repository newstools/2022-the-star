Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has warned that it will be difficult for ODM leader Raila Odinga to win Kamba region votes if he does not pick him as his running mate. The Wiper leader said Raila will not only miss the Kamba votes but also that of his supporters that extend beyond the Ukambani region. "It will present a challenge, to be honest. My constituents extend far beyond the Kamba nation and Wiper," he told KTN News when asked about the consequence of not being picked as Raila's deputy. The former Vice President, however, exuded confidence that he will be chosen as Raila's running mate. Kalonzo noted that his combination with Raila is a sure way to the presidency. "I don't want to pre-judge the issue but I still think Raila Odinga, Kalonzo Musyoka is a ticket you can't defeat in terms of quality and experience," he said. Kalonzo at the same time reiterated that they never lost the 2013 and 2017 general elections adding that he is sure their victory will be replicated in the August 9, polls if they are paired together. "If in 2013 we won, and in 2017 we won, now in 2022 as I have said that I will support Raila, obviously we will win," he said. The choice of the ODM leader's running mate is proving to be a delicate balancing act owing to the number of leaders who have expressed interest.
