Tennis Kenya (TK) will bid to host the Africa Davis Group III tournament between June and August this year. TK administrator, Nancy Nduku said confirmed they have sent bid documents to the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and are hoping to get the opportunity to stage the event for the second time in three years. Kenya last hosted the event in 2019. Nduku said the country has been hosting top-level tennis tournaments and expressed confidence that they will get the nod once again. "We have put up a strong bid based on our past experience hosting various international tournaments and that will aid our push to host the Davis Cup,” said Nduku. Kenya is up against Algeria, Morocco, and Ghana, who are also seeking to host the week-long championship where two teams get promoted to Group 2. At last year's event in Egypt, Kenya finished third behind the hosts and Benin narrowly missed out on qualification to Group 2. Nduku expressed confidence that Kenya can gain promotion with two slots up for grabs despite stiff competition coming from relegated teams like Morocco and Zimbabwe. "The target will be to gain promotion. We were very close last year and we expect stiff competition," she added. The quartet has started training and coach Thuku Rogoi hopes they will be in peak condition by the time the competition starts. "We came quite close and now we must show the same desire and fight as we did last year and at the same time minimize our mistakes and gain promotion to Group 2,” added Rogoi. The women's team will be competing in the Billie Jean King Cup in June and will be seeking to be competitive at the event.
