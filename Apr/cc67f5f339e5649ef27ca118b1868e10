The passing on of former President Mwai Kibaki, 90, on Friday united Kenyans. They mourned a true leader who left an indelible mark on hearts of majority. President Kibaki  was many things to different people. To the people of Northern Kenya, he was the one leader who connected residents with the rest of the nation by building the Isiolo-Moyale Road, which was neglected for 50 years. To many, he was the man who lifted Kenya's economy and put the country on a growth path that has not been rivalled since then. Kenyans from different divide mourned him as a true leader who had the interest of wananchi at heart. Kibaki is also remembered for midwifing and bringing to fruition the country's most progressive Constitution, which has opened up the freedom space and guaranteed the Bill of Rights. Though he achieved so much, his tenure wasn't all rosy as it was checkered with the 2007 post-election violence that saw more than 1,000 Kenyans  killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. For the wrongs he did, it is time that the country forgives him and honors the good he did.  It is prudent that President Uhuru Kenyatta considers burying him at the heroes corner. Fare Thee well Mzee Kibaki.
