Former 'Machachari' actor Govi has dated older partners. In a recent Q and A session with fans, Govi who is currently not in a relationship, was forthright and said he had no issue with it. "Uh, yes, as long as we have chemistry. In my own life, I have dated older ladies from back then." Asked if religion is a factor for him, Govi said love is never a question of religion. "Neither tribe nor race. We are all human." He said he is attracted to women but his preference is core virtuous values. He then advised men to focus on making money before settling down with a woman. "I have been in a relationship, walked away in some, I have been left in some, but the best thing is I'm still alive." He urged his fans to concentrate on working hard and avoid social media pressure. "The first time I saw myself on screen, I cried. To be honest, I get all kind of emotions."
