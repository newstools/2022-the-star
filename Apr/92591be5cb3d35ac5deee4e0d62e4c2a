After setting the 10th fastest-ever time for women's half marathon, two-time world 5,000m champion Hellen Obiri will hit the road once again when she competes at the Bengaluru 10km race in India on May 15. It will be the first time for the two-time Olympic 5,000m silver medalist to run in the Asian nation, having laid out her plans last year of transitioning to road races. The Kenya Defence Forces officer is so far enjoying her career as a marathoner courtesy of podium finishes, the latest of which was at the Istanbul Half Marathon on March 27. On that occasion, Obiri clocked 1:04:48 to win the race ahead of Ethiopian duo of Tsehay Gemechu and Bekelech Gudeta. Her time is still some way off Ethiopian Letesenbet Gidey's world record of 1:02:52 albeit it is the 10th fastest on the all-time list. In India, Obiri will be joined by fellow compatriot, 2017 World Cross Country champion Irene Cheptai, who will be out to reclaim the crown she won in 2017 when she clocked 31:51. Cheptai is also on a good run of form (pun unintended), having finished second in her last race in April at the Prague Half Marathon during which she clocked 1:07:16. Before that, the Tokyo Olympian had clocked 67:37 to finish second at the New York Half Marathon during which she went toe-to-toe with Senbere Teferi of Ethiopia. Both ladies will be hoping to make Team Kenya's squad for the World Championship in Oregon in July where Obiri will be hoping to defend her title to seal a hat-trick of world crowns. Cheptai will be angling for another appearance on the world stage after the 2017 World Championship in London, where she finished seventh in the women's 10,000m. In the men's race, former world half marathon record holder Kibiwott Kandie will be out to spoil the party for double world 5,000m champion Muktar Edris of Ethiopia. Kandie will be buoyed by the fact that his personal best of 26:51 in 10km is faster than the Bengaluru course record of 27:14, set by fellow Kenyan and another former world record holder, Geoffrey Kamworor in 2014. Two-time world 10,000m bronze medalist Agnes Tirop — now deceased — holds the course record for the women's race courtesy of the 31:19 she timed on her way to winning the event in 2019. Kandie has been out of action for the most part of last year but announced his intent for the new year when he won the men's 10,000m at the Kenya Defence Forces Athletics Championships a week ago. However, he will have to do more to overcome Edris as well as world U20 3,000m champion Tadese Worku, also of Ethiopia.
