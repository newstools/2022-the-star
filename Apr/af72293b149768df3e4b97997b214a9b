Kericho governor seat aspirant Eric Mutai on Saturday got campaign financial support after scores of his supporters held an impromptu funds drive. The funds' drive was held at Litein market, Bureti sub-county in Kericho County and realized an unknown amount of money. Mutai was on his campaign trail when he told Litein town residents that he had no money for campaigns against one of his rich challengers. Video seen by the star showed residents giving their donation which was being collected in a carrier bag at the Litein rally. “Elect me and I'll make the difference where the poor will be at par with the rich in my leadership,” Mutai said. He said he will ensure the doors of the county top office are wide open for all where those with teething problems will be given a hearing. Since the kick-off of local campaigns, Mutai has sent jitters in several political camps over his growing popularity. Mutai said his office will not be controlled by hardliners who would want to reap where they never sowed. One of his chief campaigners Bernad Boit said they will ensure Mutai who is currently the darling of electorates wins the UDA nomination ticket. An outspoken Kapsoit ward member of the county assembly Paul Chirchir said another funds drive will be held in Kericho on Monday to fund Mutai's remaining campaigns. Chirchir said no amount of intimidation or pressure will stop Dr Mutai from being elected as Kerichos's next governor. Boit who doubles as the chairman of Litein Dairy farmers and a member of the advisory board said the time had come for the county residents to elect new leaders for the benefit of all. “Those who were lucky in the past elections should pave way for others and let the county go for new leaders,” Boit said “With or without money, Mutai is poised to win both the nomination and the general election as Kericho voters have decided to change the leadership of the county by bringing in new blood,” Boit told the Star in Kericho town.
