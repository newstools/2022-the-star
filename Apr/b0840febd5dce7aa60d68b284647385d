Socialite Amber Ray says her first salary was Sh13,000 while working as a waitress at a Nairobi casino. Speaking to Obinna, Amber said she was struggling to make ends meet because she came from a poor family and all she wanted was a job. "I come from a humble background, grew up with a lot of struggles," she said. Amber said at one point she could not afford a plate of chips and a quarter piece of chicken. She said getting the job allowed her to satisfy her craving. "I would pass by some joints downtown after I get my salary. I no longer fancy chicken and chips," she said. Amber said thanks to her work ethic, she made more money from tips than she got as salary. "I used to work extremely hard that I managed to save my salary and pay all my bills with the money I got from my customers for good services," she said. Amber also worked as a hawker selling tripe. At the time she was a new mother, her son Gavin was just eight months old. She used to live in a single room with her baby. "We used to leave Gavin at my friend's place. I rush to Tao KMC then back to Kahawa West nazungusha matumbo. I had to sell stock yote ya kila siku since I did not have a fridge." Amber said her hard work paid off. The most cash she has ever handled is Sh6 million. "Money follows me. I felt priceless after that amount," she said. "Money has never made me proud. I was very humble and I took some to go and enjoy myself. I have seen more millions after but I always remember my past." "I love money. You see when you have money you don't suffer like when you don't have money. You can buy wine for yourself. Kama huna pesa utafanya nini? Imagine unateseka na unaumia bado [What would one do without money? One suffers a lot] ."
