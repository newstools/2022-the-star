KCB face holders Kabras in the Enterprise Cup final Saturday at the RFUEA ground. The final will kick off at midday to give fans an opportunity to go watch the Barthes Cup at Nyayo Stadium with champions Kenya facing Uganda at 4:30 pm. Both sides will be without their star players who have travelled with the Simbas for the Currie Cup in South Africa. The bankers will be aiming to finish the season with silverware after losing out in the Kenya Cup semis to Menengai Oilers. The former champions have made two changes to the squad with prop Oscar Simiyu coming in for George Gichure and Mannaseh Oduor coming in at second row for Elvis Olukusi. The rest of the squad remains the same with former Kenya Sevens skipper Andrew Amonde, Peter Waitere, and Steve Wamai in the back row. Michael Wanjala, Max Kangeri, and Geoff Okwatch will comprise backs. The assistant coach Dennis Mwanja said he expects a tough final. "Matches against Kabras are always competitive and hard-fought. I am confident we can go all the way and win the trophy," he noted. On their part, Kabras will rely on a youthful squad that features Hillary Mwanjilwa, Asman Mugerwa, Hillary Odhiambo, and David Bunduki in the forwards while Barry Robinson and South African Ntabeni Dukisa, Habil Malik, and Rodco Sylster will be the key actors in the backs. Head coach Jerome Muller said his charges are well prepared for the clash "KCB are one of our biggest rivals and we want to finish the season on a high by defending the trophy we last won in 2019," added Muller. Kabras thrashed Homeboyz 37-11 in the semis while KCB edged Impala 20-18.
