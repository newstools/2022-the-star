Lilian Ng'ang'a has advised political aspirants to take care of their mental health. The former wife of Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua told aspirants to be ready to handle rejection. "Anybody running for office should be mentally prepared for after August 8," she said. "If you lose, the phone stops ringing, the crowd and groupies disappear, the 'Mheshimiwa' tag goes away etcetera. What and who will you be left with? Doesn't hurt to evaluate." Her message came a few days after Bahati cried on camera after his nomination was allegedly recalled. Earlier, Ng'ang'a called out creatives venturing into politics. "... Most of such have no intentions of serving the people... it's just chasing clout. Terrible!"
