United Democratic Alliance party parliamentary nomination results for Mogotio Constituency in Baringo County have been cancelled over rigging allegations. Incumbent Daniel Tuitoek scooped a total of 9,662 votes before his opponent Reuben Kiborek who got 9,469 contested the results. "The whole exercise is shambolic, it has to be recanted and repeated," Kiborek said. The claims forced the Sub-county Returning Officer Thomas Kong'a to suspend the results to avoid an eruption of chaos, although he insisted the process was good. "I wonder how some ballot boxes were suddenly sneaked in the tallying centre late at the time I was still leading," Kiborek said. But Tuitoek disputed any form of rigging saying according to him the exercise seems transparent, free and fair. Kong'a however suspended the exercise until further notice, saying he will await communication from the party headquarters.
