Eggs are a great way to kick-start your day. A chef’s salad is not only nutritious but can keep you full and satisfied throughout your day. The protein in eggs helps to maintain and repair body tissues and muscles while the salad is high in fiber, Vitamin A, C, folate, and beta carotene. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Hard boil the eggs and cook the bacon in a pan over medium heat until crisp.
