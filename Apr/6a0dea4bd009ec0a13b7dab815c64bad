Google has said that it will be giving users more control over ads they see starting today. Google, which makes money by showing you ads based on your search history and other online behavior has seen a lot of rage in various social media accounts for recommending ads about pregnancy, parenting, dating, or weight loss. This, plus a survey they conducted showed that users wanted to have more control over such categories. In December 2020, Google started letting people in the United States opt out of ads on YouTube that feature alcohol or gambling. Now, users around the world can opt-out of ads that cover uncomfortable or traumatic subjects. Google says the settings will apply to all Google’s display network, not just for YouTube ads. Here is how to start using targeted Display ads: Google Display Network targeting allows you to set where or when your ad is shown based on features of your ideal audience, such as their personal interests, age or gender. This means your ad can show up on sites related to your business, or to users who match the specific criteria that you’ve specified. If you aren’t already running ads on the Google Display Network as part of your Google Ads account, here’s how you can do so: Google’s support page for the sensitive ad category note that, while it should show you fewer ads for products in each category you’ve chosen to limit, the topics may still appear in other ads. You may still see alcohol, gambling, or images of these activities in an ad. For example, an airline ad featuring someone drinking a glass of champagne. The company also notes that it “does not allow advertisers to personalize ads based on certain topics, like alcohol and gambling, but you may see ads about these things based on related interests. For example, advertisers who sell alcohol might want to show their ads to sports fans.
