Chipu finished the Barthes Cup by claiming the bronze medal after beating Madagascar 49-15 at Nyayo Stadium. The hosts outscored the Indian Ocean islanders in a fast-paced match played in damp conditions after a slight downpour minutes before kickoff. Kenya were quick off the blocks and skipper John Baraka went over from a yard scrum with Tony Okecth converting for a 7-0 lead. Curtis Olago's charges were relentless, piling pressure on the visitors and they were rewarded again when burly flanker Tyson Macharia touched down with Oketch converting for a 14-0 lead. The Madagascans regrouped and dominated possession briefly, resulting in a penalty slotted home by Rolland Ratokoson, reducing the deficit to 17-3. Oketch punished the visitors' indiscipline at the breakdown with a penalty, stretching the lead to 20-3. Chipu continued to attack and probe for weaknesses for the remainder of the half, resulting in two quick tries by Gabriel Ayimba and Dave Mwangi for a 30-3 lead. The visitors responded with a well-taken try just before halftime courtesy of Ratokoson and he duly converted for a 30-10 score at the interval. On resumption, the side known as the Makis came out firing on all cylinders and scored an unconverted try through Tsiaronaina Michel. Chipu stepped up a gear with lock Persian Kola, Winstone Macharia and Cornelius Mukoro scoring a try each with Mukoro and Oketch adding a conversion each to close out the encounter.
