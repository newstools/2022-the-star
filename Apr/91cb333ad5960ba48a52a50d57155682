Kanze Dena celebrated her 42nd birthday yesterday. The State House spokesperson took to social media to celebrate herself, stating how proud she is of the woman she has turned out to be. "The orchestra of life continues. The owner and director of the orchestra have put out a new sheet of music for you," she wrote. "I love how you have played your part so far, ensuring the rhythm holds, adjusting to the different tempos. High notes, low notes, with eyes firmly on the director, in season and out of season. Cheers!" Her BFF Lulu Hassan thanked Kanze for being a big sister to her. "Happy birthday. May God fulfil the desires of your heart. You are a unique woman." Her sister Elsie Stephen, a former Miss Kenya beauty queen, described Kanze as an inspiration.
