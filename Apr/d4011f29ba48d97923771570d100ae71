Shinyalu MP aspirant Ambeyi Likavo has asked DAP-K to hand him the party ticket to contest the seat. Ambeyi said he introduced the party in Shinyalu and should be given the chance to represent it if nominations will not be held. “It's me who brought DAP-K to Shinyalu in January, recruited more than 7,000 members and opened the branch office,” Ambeyi said. “Current MP Justus Kizito is moving around saying he has been given the ticket, yet we know tickets have not been issued.” However, Kizito has termed complaints by Ambeyi as naive. “It is the responsibility of the party to know whom it wants to field and not me,” Kizito said. He also said he was ready to abide by the  party decision regarding the Shinyalu race. Deputy party leader Ayub Savula on Saturday said the party will issue a certificate to Kizito this week, saying Kizito joined the party on March 26, which was the deadline. According to IEBC timelines, parties have until April 21 to conclude nominations for their aspirants for the August 9 polls. DAP-K patron Eugene Wamalwa’s personal assistant Kizito Temba said the party encourages aspirants to engage in structured negotiations to reach consensus on who should be given tickets for various elective seats. He said aspirants who fail to agree will be subjected to fair nominations to pick flagbearers.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
