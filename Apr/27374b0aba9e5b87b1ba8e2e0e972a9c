Kenya Simbas face a stern test when they encounter Griffons in their third match of the Currie Cup today in Cape Town. The Simbas lost two of their opening fixtures, going down 51-14 to Valke and 22-21 to Zimbabwe. Griffons, a South African provincial outfit, are joint top on the log with 15 points after bonus wins over Border Bulldogs (106-7 ) and Zimbabwe 48-5. Head coach Paul Odera said his charges must gain parity in the forwards and setpieces if they harbour chances of being competitive against theSouth Africans. “It will be a tough game. We need to be competitive upfront. We must try and secure our own throws in the lineout and win our scrum feeds as well as be disruptive at the breakdown,” noted Odera. Odera said he was keen to have the side make improvements after a late start to the tournament. "From our performances, you can see we are improving and the more matches, we play the better we become," said Odera. Odera will rotate the squad after injuries to props Ian Njenga and Andrew Siminyu flanker George Nyambua and fullback Darwin Mukidza (hamstring) while Jone Kubu has been given the weekend off due to fatigue. The former skipper will start with Brian Waraba and Edward Mwaura in the front row following impressive performances off the bench last week alongside Coleman Were. Brian Juma and Thomas Okeyo start in the second row while skipper Dan Sikuta, Elkeans Musonye and Clinton Odhiambo will be the men to watch in the back row. In the backs, Samuel Asati will partner Geoffrey Ominde as the half-back combination with Vincent Onyala and John Okoth in midfield as Derrick Ashiundu, Jacob Ojee and Timothy Okwemba complete the back three. Griffons will rely on Xolabi Jacobs, Dandre Delport, Curtley Thomas and Ludio Williams in the forwards with Ethan Williams, Lloyd April, Duan Pretorious and Domenic Smit the pick of the backs. The Simbas are using the Currie Cup as preparations for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers to be played in France in July.
