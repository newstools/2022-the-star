Candidates who sat the KCSE exam will know their results before the end of this month. Marking of week one subjects—English, Mathematics and Kiswahili—was completed on Monday morning. Sources told the Star that a number of examiners were seen checking out of marking centres on Monday. "We are trying to ensure the other subjects are done before the end of this week," said a teacher who asked not to be named. Education CS George Magoha said the results will be available before the end of April. Magoha spoke at Kenya High School where he opened a CBC classroom. University Education PS Simon Nabukwesi had previously said the candidates will join university in June. He said those who will be enrolled in colleges and vocational institutes will report in September. The learners had until April 1 to select courses via the Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement portal. This will give parents only one month to prepare for the learners' enrolment. The exam is likely to be Magoha's last as Education CS. Some 831,015 candidates sat the exam in 10,413 centres compared to 752,981 in 10,437 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 78,034 or 9.39 per cent. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
