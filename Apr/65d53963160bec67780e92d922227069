Immediate former Harambee Starlets head coach, Charles Okere, has rejoined Kenyan Premier League champions Tusker. Okere had previously served as assistant coach at the Ruaraka-based club prior to his appointment as the national women’s team head coach mid last year. “I have learnt a lot with the national team and it is those lessons I aim to implement back here and ensure the success of both the senior and Youth Team,” Okere told the team's official website. Other than his main role as the first team's second assistant coach, Okere is expected to double up as head coach of the youth team. The youthful tactician took charge of the academy side last Sunday and was also spotted in the dugout as the senior team battled Gor Mahia in a league match on Saturday. “This is something that I enjoy doing, working with young players and helping develop them. “They have just played four games in the Division Two League and definitely our ambition is to earn promotion at the end of the season,” Okere said.
