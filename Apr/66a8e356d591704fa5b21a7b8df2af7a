Reigning champions, Tusker, moved to within three points of leaders Kakamega Homeboyz after pipping debutants FC Talanta 1-0 in a closely contested Kenyan Premier League clash at the Ruaraka Grounds on Saturday. Rodgers Ouma's 32nd-minute rasping strike was enough to separate the two sides at full-time. Ouma's effort from the edge of the box caught Talanta's custodian Kevin Otieno napping in goal. The win fired the brewers to 52 points, three adrift of Homeboyz who have a match in hand. Tusker suffered a setback just a few to the break after dependable forward Lawrence Luvanda limped off with an injury, forcing head coach Robert Matano to introduce Stewart Omondi. Later in the game, Shaphan Oyugi made way for John Njuguna while Ibrahim was rested for Deogratious Ojok. On the other hand, Talanta introduced Peter Njammah and Edwin Lavatsa for Alvin Ochieng and Brian Yakhama respectively. Editing by Tony Mballa
