Detectives in Juja, Kiambu county, are looking for three suspects who killed a 23-year-old university student in cold blood and stole his valuables. Joel Juma, a Fourth Year industrial chemistry student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, was stabbed twice. Juma was confronted as he walked from his hostel to his friends’ house on Tuesday morning. His girlfriend, a law student at the Mt Kenya University, told police she had escorted him to get revision materials from his classmates a few blocks away when the gang accosted them. The girlfriend had gone to visit her lover and found him studying for his examinations. She prepared a meal that they shared together before they retired to bed. Juma later woke up to study but at 2am, he asked her to escort him to get some reference material that he needed. It was while on their way that the gang attacked them near hotel Lilies, demanding money and mobile phones. During the attack the deceased was hit and stabbed. Police said guards who heard the commotion rushed to the scene and took Juma and his girlfriend to a local dispensary where he was pronounced dead. Detectives have since established that a notorious gang, which escaped the ongoing operation in Kayole and Dandora, has found a safe haven in Gachororo, where they are regrouping. Elsewhere, police are investigating an incident in which a woman was found murdered in a hotel along Desai Road in Ngara, Nairobi. The woman who did not have identification documents had checked into the hotel with a man who is missing. The body of the woman was found lying with a bed sheet wrapped around her mouth and had two stab wounds on the neck.  The body was moved to the mortuary. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
