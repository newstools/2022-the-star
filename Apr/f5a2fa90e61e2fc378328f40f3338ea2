Thousands of mourners were Saturday locked out of the approved school grounds where former president Mwai Kibaki's final send-off mass is taking place. This was after the ground was filled to capacity and could not accommodate more people. People who got in were also not allowed to get out of the grounds. As such, thousands of people have been compelled to follow proceedings from outside. The tent set up targeted to accommodate 15,000 mourners but people exceeded the target. They were provided with more chairs put outside the tents but were also depleted. "I had attended the burial but I was informed that I couldn't be allowed in after the venue was filled to capacity," said Margaret Nyokabi. Residents faulted the organizers for not erecting a big screen outside the venue for people to follow the proceedings. They suggested that another screen should have been erected in Othaya town so that those who were locked outside could follow. Some opted to go back home and follow proceedings from their television sets. "I think they underestimated the number of mourners. They should have set screens outside the venue as well for people outside to follow the proceedings," said Edward Njoroge one of the mourners locked outside.
