A four-year-old girl on Tuesday narrated to the court how her father defiled her moments after they returned from church. The man identified as PO picked his daughter from her aunt's place after church and took her home where he allegedly committed the act. Kibera magistrate William Tulen also heard that the accused committed the offence just days after completing a one-year-jail sentence for an undisclosed offence. The incident also happened months after the minor's mother died of unspecified ailment. With the man in jail and the wife dead, the children were living at a city children’s home. The victim was staying with her aunt. On the day the offence was committed, PO had just returned from a trip and then proceeded to the minor's aunt and picked his daughter. “My father came back from a trip and defiled me. He caused me to feel a lot of pain," the girl told court. The prosecution was forced to intervene as the girl became emotional after seeing the accused in court. She cried causing the hearings to delay for some time. Court documents revealed the aunt who was changing the minor’s cloth noted something abnormal and some discharges from her private parts. According to the charge sheet, PO committed the offence on January 16 in at Matuini village in Dagoretti subcounty, Nairobi. He was charged with committing an indecent act with a child contrary to the law. He denied the charges and had his bond request denied after the prosecution said he could tamper with the witness. “We oppose the accused person being released on bond as he may interfere with the witness who is his biological daughter,” the prosecution said. Tulen adjourned the matter and directed that it should proceeds on May 9 for a further hearing. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
