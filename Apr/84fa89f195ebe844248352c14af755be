Equity’s wings to fly has warned that it will stop sponsoring any students who is involved in misconduct and indiscipline in schools. Speaking during the commissioning of 422 student beneficiaries in Garissa University, Equity bank's marketing director David Nyamu said out of every 11 students who applied, only one was picked. "We will collaborate with relevant government authorities to ensure that we take action on any student with indiscipline cases and give the slots to other needy students," he said. Nyamu urged the students to exercise good conduct and high level of discipline. "This is a God-given opportunity for the beneficiaries because so many vulnerable children had applied for the program and missed the slots," he said. "We don't want to hear that the students under this program are the ones misbehaving in schools." Garissa Township Deputy county commissioner Solomon Komen urged the students to always consult with the bank before transferring to other schools to ensure that their fees is disbursed to their new schools. Komen said the government will not hesitate to take action against any student who is involved in activities that are unlawful. On his part, Garissa County director of education Hussein Ali called for more slots in the coming years especially for regions that have high poverty levels. "The slots allocated to this county are not adequate because people in this area are nomads and have lost most of their livestock due to recurring droughts," Ali noted. This year, Wings to fly in collaboration with the ministry of education through Elimu scholarship program is fully sponsoring 37,000 students for their secondary education. The comprehensive scholarship covers school fees, shopping, transport and pocket money for selected students.
