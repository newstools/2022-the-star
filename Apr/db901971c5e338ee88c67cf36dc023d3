Former Tahidi High actress Jackie Matubia is off the market. Her baby daddy Blessing Lung'aho proposed during his birthday on Sunday. The couple first publicised their relationship on Valentine's Day. They are expecting their first child. In a past interview, Matubia said she did not publicise her union with Madiba because she respects his privacy. "I wasn't putting it out there for people I was doing it for me," she said. "It's all about keeping private things private and social things social. We are both actors so we are already in the public eye so this is the only thing we have that is private." Matubia said they announced their relationship because they knew the media would have spotted them on a date. The couple met during an interview two years ago. "She interviewed me on Switch TV two years ago," Madiba said. Matubia said they were friends for long, but agreed to let the show Zora, in which they were cast members, end. "We didn't want to confuse viewers."
