Downing Street has now confirmed Johnson's meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. A Number 10 spokesman said: “The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelensky in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. "They will discuss the UK’s long term support to Ukraine and the PM will set out a new package of financial and military aid.” The deputy head of the Ukrainian president's office, Andriy Sybiha, said on Facebook, that Johnson and Zelensky were holding "a tete-a-tete meeting". "The UK is the leader in defence support for Ukraine. The leader in the anti-war coalition. The leader in sanctions against the Russian aggressor," he added.
