Azimio la Umoja presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga is expected in Trans Nzoia on Saturday. Raila will attend the burial of his close ally, the late Jotham Nyukuri who until his death was a member of the party's trustee board. The former Premier will thereafter hold a rally drumming up support for the Azimio one Kenya Alliance in Kiminini. Trans Nzoia ODM Chairman Caleb Amisi hinted that the visit of the former premier will change the political landscape in the region which has been perceived as a stronghold of Deputy President William Ruto’s One Kenya Alliance. "Those crisscrossing this county with their bottoms –up mentality while chest thumping should from now henceforth prepare themselves for a titanic political duel. We in Azimio one Kenya will be doing our politics in a mature way," he said. Raila will be landing at the late politician’s home shortly after noon . Raila will fly to the US next week on a trip that is expected to be his last mission abroad before the August 9 General Election. Sources close to the ODM leader told the Star, he will leave the country hours after concluding ODM party nominations on April 21. The tour will last for a week and the former Prime Minister will be expected back in the country on April 28. The Easter season will start on April 15, Good Friday and end on Monday, April 18.
