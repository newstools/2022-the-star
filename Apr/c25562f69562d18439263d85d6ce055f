Energy CS Monica Juma has urged Kenyans not to panic over the fuel shortage being witnessed countrywide. Speaking at the Energy Ministry offices in Nairobi on Thursday, Juma assured Kenyans that there is enough fuel in storage that could sustain the country till June. “We have sufficient stock in our depots. The schedule for incoming products is uninterrupted. We have quantities that would last us to the end of June without issues. No cause of panic,” Juma said. The CS said the ministry has already held several successful meetings with oil marketing companies and traders to address any concerns and stress. She noted that the government is ready to honour its obligation in ensuring there’s an adequate supply of fuel in the country. Juma said marketers were hoarding the commodity in anticipation that the prices might be hiked later today. "I confirm that hoarding is taking place. It is criminal and amounts to economic sabotage. We hope that the supply and demand will correct itself in the next 72 hours after fuel prices have been announced," Juma said. "Economic sabotage is a capital offence. We are going to deal with perpetrators on a case by case basis. This cannot be tolerated," she said.
