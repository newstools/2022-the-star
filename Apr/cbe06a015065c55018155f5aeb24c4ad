Thika Town MP Patrick Wainaina wa Jungle who was eyeing the Kiambu governor seat on United Democratic Alliance ticket has disputed the results. Addressing the media, Wa Jungle said that the UDA party favoured Senator Wamatangi as he was close to top party officials. He said that the exercise wasn't free and fair saying that in some stations, some of his agents were locked out of the counting exercise. "They have rigged me and I want to state it here that after two days, I will give my stand but I will be on the ballot," he said. He further said that his name Wajungle was omitted from the voting materials creating confusion. He said that he will traverse the county and ask the people of Kiambu to vote for him. "People of Kiambu will vote for me due to my development record," he said. Since morning, Kiambu Senator Kimani Matangi has been camping at the Kiambu Institute of Science Technology accompanied by his supporters. Nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura also spent most of the time in KIST requesting the exercise to be repeated. Mwaura told the Star that the exercise was marked with irregularities. He said that the UDA party risks losing relevance on the ground due to shoddy nominations. Women Rep Gathoni Muchomba, Juja MP George Koimburi, and Kigo Njenga among others were issued nomination certificates.
