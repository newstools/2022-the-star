CF Montréal defensive midfielder Victor Wanyama has appealed to Kenyan youth to focus on spreading peace through sports and avoid divisive campaigns as the August 9, polls, near. In a video he shared on Instagram on Wednesday, April 6, which marks the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace (IDSDP), Wanyama said that sports play a major role in knitting a better society. "The Victor Wanyama Foundation would like to encourage all the young people to use sports to spread the message of peace and love among different communities," he said. "Sports do not recognize colour or tribe. Let us preach peace during the electioneering period." Wanyama urged the young people to stay alert and resist any bad influences during campaigns. "Let us not allow ourselves to be used by politicians, especially during this time," he urged. The IDSDP began in 2013  after a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) declaration and its main aim is to recognize the sports promotion of peace and harmony among communities worldwide. The first official celebration was on April 6, 2014. The theme for the IDSDP 2022 is ‘Securing a Sustainable and Peaceful Future for All: The Contribution of Sport’, with a primary focus on climate change and lowering Greenhouse Gas emissions.
