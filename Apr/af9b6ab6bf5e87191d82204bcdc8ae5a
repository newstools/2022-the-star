Mike Sonko's lastborn daughter Sandra Mbuvi has not bleached her skin. In a Q and A session with her fans on Instagram, one asked her, "Do you have tattoos?" "No. Like why would you put a sticker on a Bentley?" Sandra responded. Another fan asked her why she changed her skin colour. "Why did you bleach? Kwani you don't like yourself?" Sandra denied this, saying she is all-natural. "I love myself more than anything in this world." Another fan asked how Sandra deals with hateful comments, seeing as she is a public figure who attracts a lot of attention on social media. "I just ignore reading negative comments. It is a waste of my time. I just let them hate, when they are tired, they will shut up."
