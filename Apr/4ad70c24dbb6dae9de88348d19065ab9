Shujaa have relinquished the Africa Cup Sevens title after losing 22-17 to Uganda in Kampala on Sunday. Innocent Simiyu’s charges, however, bounced back to beat Zambia 19-12 to qualify for the Rugby World Cup Sevens in South Africa in September, alongside Uganda and Zimbabwe. Shujaa were on the back foot from the onset against Uganda, who were fired up by a partisan crowd at Kyadondo Rugby Club. Phillip Wokorach opened the scoring with a well-taken try. The former Kabras star tormented the Kenyan defence and scored his second minutes later, which he duly converted for a 12-0 lead. Adrian Kasito then crossed the whitewash to extend the lead to 17-0 at the interval. On resumption, the Ugandans dominated territory and scored their fourth try through Aaron Ofoyrwoth for a 22-0 lead. Shujaa scored two consolation tries through Alvin Otieno and Nelson Oyoo with Tony Omondi converting but it was too little too late. Kenya had begun the tournament with a 19-0 win over Senegal, a 24-19 win over Zimbabwe and a 33-7 victory against Namibia. However, Shujaa lost 12-7 to Madagascar on Sunday in treacherous conditions following a heavy downpour.
