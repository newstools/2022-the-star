Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge insists winning the Premier League has to be the priority for his old club as they head into a potentially pivotal clash with title rivals Manchester City. Jurgen Klopp's side have already won the Carabao Cup, face City again next weekend in the FA Cup semi-final and have one foot in the last four of the Champions League. They won the first leg against Benfica to remain in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season. However, Aldridge, who won back-to-back league and FA Cups in the late 1980s, stressed winning all four remains a dream. But if he had to choose one it would be adding to the first title in 30 years the club won in 2020.
