The Los Angeles Lakers are one of the biggest sporting brands across the world and the team is currently in tatters. Russell Westbrook has partly blamed the coach. The team has fired Frank Vogel, the coach who led them to the NBA title in 2020. Vogel’s dismissal came after the Lakers, who had been expected to compete for the title again this season, missed the playoffs. Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka said in a statement firing Vogel was an incredibly difficult decision to make, but one that was necessary at this point. “I have a tremendous amount of respect for Frank both on and off the court,” he said. "All of us here wish Frank and his wonderful family all the best for the future,” Pelinka said.
