National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has now joined the Kenya Kwanza Alliance team led by deputy president William Ruto. It is while joining the alliance that the Speaker said his decision was also influenced by the phrase "sipangwingwi' since he is in charge of his political destiny. Ruto has been using the phrase 'sipangwingwi' to pass a message that how Kenyans will vote in the August 9 polls won't be influenced by a few influential people. Speaking at a Karen hotel where he signed a coalition agreement with the Kenya Kwanza Alliance, Muturi said his choice to work with the DP was after intense consultations. The Speaker used the occasion to lash out at those who were keen on pushing him toward a particular political direction saying their mission was dead on arrival. It is then that Muturi said : "Ata mimi sipangwingwi. Wale walikua wanafikiria wanaeza kunipanga poleni. Hii miaka yangu hainiruhusu kupangwa na mtu". Loosely translates to: "Even me I cannot be directed on a political direction to take. Those who thought can direct me on where to go I'm sorry. At my age, I cannot be told which way to go". Muturi joining the alliance comes exactly four months before the August 9, polls. He said his decision to join the alliance was after consultation with party members and community leaders. “I want to thank Kenyans who have supported us in this country for their continued support. As Kenya Kwanza Alliance, we will be focused on an agenda that brings us together as a country.” Muturi said that the party will continue to have its doors open, should members of the opposition feel to join it. “We will all welcome members in the opposition with a warm embrace and open arms. Come home – to the real right, to the national camp,” Muturi said The speaker assured the alliance supporters that they will protect their votes in the August 9 polls to ensure the will of Kenyans is upheld.
