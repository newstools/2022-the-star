Scottie Scheffler admits he teared up when he first got an invitation to the Masters, of which he is now the 2022 champion. Scheffler held a three-shot lead after 54 holes and carded a closing 71 at Augusta National to finish 10 under par and three shots clear of Rory McIlroy, despite four-putting the 72nd hole. Scheffler held his nerve and withstood one of the finest rounds to etch his name into folklore as a world No 1 who has won the Masters.
