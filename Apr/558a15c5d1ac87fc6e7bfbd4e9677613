A man almost disrupted the State funeral service of the late President Mwai Kibaki after he ran to the dais. The man ran to Arch Bishop Martin Kivuva soon after President Uhuru Kenyatta's speech requesting for a short time to speak. "I need just two minutes to make a few remarks. Just two minutes I want to say something," he was heard saying. However, the man of God gently declined his request and asked the mass  orderlies to gently escort him off the stage. "He is a son of our nation who is emotional at the loss of our president. Please treat him nicely," Kivuva urged. The security personnel quickly whisked him away. The man is believed to the same one who stripped at Parliament Buildings on Tuesday claiming to be the late president's grandson. The scene was captured on a video that went viral as the man wailed saying he was a beneficiary of free education pioneered by Kibaki. "Why have you gone so soon," the man was heard wailing amid tears. He was, however, stopped by the police and ordered to dress and leave the premises.
