The Communications Authority of Kenya has extended the deadline for the SIM card registration by six months. The government agency extended the deadline after a majority of Kenyans failed to register their SIM cards by April 15. Citizens now have up to October 15 this year to have their details updated. CA has also warned that users who will not have registered their SIM cards by October 15 will be fined. This comes after CA Director General Ezra Chiloba said the Authority will consult mobile network operators on the possibility of extending the SIM card registration exercise to give customers an opportunity to validate respective details of registration. The extension also followed extensive consultations between CA and the Mobile Network Operators. Chiloba and the MNOs held a meeting on Thursday, April 14 to assess the success rate of the exercise. "It is the responsibility of the operators who will advise on whether to switch off the unregistered lines or probably give an extension and allow as many Kenyans as possible to register," Chiloba had said. CA maintained that the registration exercise is anchored in the constitution mandating mobile Network Operators to carry out the exercise. On Friday, Safaricom rolled out the online registration of SIM cards. This is after an uproar from Kenyans on social media, who told the company to follow in the footsteps of Telkom who had rolled out the online Sim Card registration.
