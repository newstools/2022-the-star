A fatal accident led to a traffic snarl up that went up to seven hours along the Tsavo stretch of the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. The accident involving a truck happened few kilometers from Mtito Andei. It is not clear what caused the accident but the head of the truck was completely destroyed and the driver is said to have died in the accident. Motorists including night passenger buses spent the night in the snarl up as movement on both sides came to a stand still. Slow movement has resumed though the jam is yet to be fully opened.
