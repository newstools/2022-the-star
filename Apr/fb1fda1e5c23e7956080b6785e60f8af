World under 20 800m champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi is eyeing his first win in the senior ranks at next weekend's Kip Keino Classic at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Wanyonyi said he is optimistic about harvesting a great result at the World Continental Tour Gold event after a month-long training at Kapsowar Training Camp in Nandi County. "This time, I am training to compete at the Kip Keino Classic. I want to try my best to get home with good results. I want to gauge my speed and endurance at the championships," the World Under-20 record holder said. The 19-year-old  set a national and championship record of 1:43.76 to storm to victory at the World Under 20 Championship in Nairobi last year. Having been locked out of the edition of the biennial championship in Cali, Colombia due to age, Wanyonyi will not be able to defend his title. However, that is water under the bridge for the youngster who believes more glory awaits him in the senior ranks. “Competing at the senior ranks gives me an advantage in training as I plan to enter into top-level running. I have had good times in the junior level where I won the top title,” he said. The Trans Nzoia-born runner says he has improved considerably since he started training at Kapsowar, run by 2008 Olympic 800m silver medalist Janeth Jepkosgei. “I have had good training in this camp. I am ready for the championships. I want to run well today and tomorrow in this career,” Wanyonyi said. The camp was visited by the federation’s president Jack Tuwei and Youth Development chairman Barnaba Korir who promised to improve the lives of young runners. Tuwei said the country needs young people that will be running in the future, especially at the Olympic Games. “These young people here are our future and we must protect, nurture their talents to represent us well,” Tuwei said.
