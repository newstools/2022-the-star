Six Nations champions France will kick off their title defence against Italy in the first round of the 2023 tournament on February 5 while Wales meet Ireland and England play Scotland a day earlier, organisers announced on Wednesday. The final round will be played on 'Super Saturday' on March 18 with Scotland hosting Italy, France meeting Wales, and Ireland welcoming England. France claimed their first Grand Slam and championship title in the tournament since 2010 as they outclassed England 25-13 in March.= "The 2022 championship ended in one of the most exciting Super Saturdays in history with an incredible performance by Italy, a triple crown win for Ireland, and a long-awaited Grand Slam for France," Six Nations Rugby CEO Ben Morel said. "Once again, fans had to wait until the final game was played to know who this year's champions would be, and the rugby action did not disappoint. "The combination of incredible broadcast coverage of the championship and the eagerly anticipated return of fans at games meant this year's Six Nations felt truly special." Scotland travel to Twickenham Stadium on the opening weekend seeking to retain the Calcutta Cup. The second round will see Ireland, who finished second this year, take on France in Dublin on Feb. 11 while Scotland meet Wales and England host Italy. Wales will host England, who were third this year, in the third round of action. Next year's championship will offer players the chance to cement their places before the Rugby World Cup in France.
