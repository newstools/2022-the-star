Former Africa cross country bronze medallist Charles Yosei Muneria will highlight Kenya Prisons Service Athletics Championships today at the Kasarani Stadium, Kasarani. Muneria will compete in the 10,000m as he seeks to win his first track title after winning the Kenya Prisons Cross Country Championships four times. Muneria said he will use the event as a build-up for the national athletics trials ahead of Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and World Championships in Oregon. “I have prepared well and I hope to carry the day in my 10,000m specialty,” said Muneria, who has been competing across all surfaces. Muneria added: “I wish I could win my first title to boost my morale ahead of the national championships. I would like to replicate my cross country wins on the track,” added Yosei, who also won half marathon silver at the Africa Beach Games in 2019. Muneria is expected to face off with Wilfred Kimitei, Geoffrey Korir, and John Mwangangi among others. Others in the mix include world 1,500m champion Timothy Cheruiyot who will be chasing the 800m title away from his usual 1,500m. The Olympic Games 1,500m silver medallist is also the Commonwealth Games 1,500m silver medallist. In the women's cadre, former Africa Games 10,000m champion Alice Aprot will be chasing the title in her specialty. She will be up against world marathon champion Ruth Chepng’etich, two-time world under-20 3,000m steeplechase champion Celliphine Chespol and Lilian kasait Rengeruk among others.
