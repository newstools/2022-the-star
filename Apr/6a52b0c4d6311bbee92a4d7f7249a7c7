Five voters who claim that they voted in last week’s UDA primaries want the court to block the party from forwarding names of all nominees to IEBC. Four of them are Jubilee Party members who claim to have voted in the UDA nomination in Kirinyanga county, while one is an ODM member who voted in Uasin Gishu county. Kennedy Gachenge, Francis Mwangi, Stanley Wanjiku, Peter Mwangi and Edgar Ochieng want the court to bar UDA from forwarding the names to IEBC for gazettement. “Pending the hearing and determination of the application, the court be pleased to grant conservatory orders restraining UDA from forwarding the names of the purported nominees to IEBC,” they said. They further want the court to also bar IEBC from taking any action, including publishing or gazetting the names of the UDA nominees coming from last week’s nominations process. Through lawyer Ndegwa Njiiru, Ochieng said he is a registered voter in Uasin Gishu county and a member of ODM, but he participated in the UDA nominations at Uasin Gishu at Bwayi Primary School polling station. He said the polling clerks in charge of the nominations identified the voters from the IEBC voter register and did not have a membership register from their party. “UDA failed to provide its election official with the mandatory members register in the polling stations for purposes of conducting the party primaries but instead heavily relied and unlawfully utilised the IEBC register,” court papers said. On the other hand, Mwangi said he is a voter in Kirinyaga and a registered Jubilee member but he also participated in the UDA nominations in Kinya Kiiru polling station. “UDA allowed me, being a member of Jubilee Party, to participate in their nominations of April 14, 2022, when I am not a member of the party,” he said. Ndegwa said UDA has colluded with IEBC to conduct fraudulent nomination through the use of IEBC voter register instead of the political parties register.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
