Brazilian soccer great Pele was discharged from hospital on Thursday, Sao Paulo’s Albert Einstein hospital said, three days after he was admitted to continue receiving treatment for a colon tumour. Pele’s clinical condition is good and stable, doctors said. Widely considered to be the best footballer of all time, the 81-year-old had surgery to remove the tumor in September 2021 and has since been in and out of hospital for treatment on a regular basis. In February, Pele was admitted for a round of chemotherapy when a urinary infection was identified, keeping him in longer than planned. Former Brazil, Santos, and New York Cosmos forward have suffered a series of health issues in recent years, including a hip surgery that left him with recurring pain and trouble walking unaided. Pele has reduced his public appearances but remains active on social media.
