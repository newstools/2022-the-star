Wajir governor aspirant Siyad Abdullahi on Wednesday called  for a closer relationship between parties that form the Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya coalition. Abdullahi, who will be contesting the seat on a Wiper ticket, said since Oka has fully decided to back ODM party leader Raila Odinga, it would be fair to reciprocate the gesture in other elective seats. There is already discontent from eight fringe parties that are members of the Azimio-One Kenya coalition threatening to quit if their grievances are not addressed. Among the things listed by the parties is their reservation on alleged planned zoning, saying they will not be party to it. On Wednesday, key officials of the parties, led by Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader Alfred Mutua, raised concerns over the lack of inclusivity and consultations in making key decisions in the coalition. But according to Abdullahi, politics was about give and take, emphasising on the need for aspirants under Oka, especially those going for the governor seat, to be  given special consideration. He said he was confident of clinching the seat because he has done [his] ground work very well and the message of hope and change that he has passed to the people resonates very well with them. “However for me to clinch the seat then some of us will have to make sacrifices and support one candidate so that we don’t play into the hands of our opponents.” Abdullahi, a businessman who has worked and lived in the US for close to 20 years, has already been endorsed by his Mithimal subclan and the Degodia clan. The businessman said he is determined to change the county for the better and ensure that devolution works for the people. In Wajir, ODM has former governor Ahmed Abdullahi as its governor aspirant while Jubilee has Mohamed Elmi. Others in the race are Deputy Governor Ahmed Muktar (UDA), Senator Abdullahi Ali, Ugaas Sheikh (PNU) and Adam Hassan.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
