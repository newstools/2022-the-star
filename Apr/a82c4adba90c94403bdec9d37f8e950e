Two people were on Monday arraigned for allegedly defrauding a man in a fake gas cylinder business using a Facebook account. Justine Mwirigi and Ruth Macharia were presented before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa where they were charged with the offence. According to the charge sheet, the accused persons allegedly defrauded Robert Isiche Mzee a sum of Sh100, 000 which he paid as a deposit for the delivery of gas cylinders. The offence was allegedly committed on December 3, 2021. The two claimed that they had a wholesale shop dealing with gas cylinders along Makupa Lumumba road in Mombasa County. Mzee saw the said advert on Facebook and contacted them so that he can buy the listed products. The accused persons then sent a quotation to the complainant totalling Sh396, 340. He was directed to pay a 30 per cent deposit. Mzee paid a Sh100,000 commitment fee and was told to wait for his good to be delivered to Nairobi. After the payment, the accused persons were not able to deliver the goods as agreed and they are said to have resorted to giving excuses. They later blocked the complainant from accessing them on phone forcing him to report the matter at Lang'ata police station leading to their arrest. On Monday, the two denied any wrongdoing and urged the court to release them on bond. The magistrate released them on a Sh300, 000 bond or a cash bail of Sh200,000 with the surety of the same amount. Kitagwa directed that the matter be mentioned on May 5 for pre-trial.
