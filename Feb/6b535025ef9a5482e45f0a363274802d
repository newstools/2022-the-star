Kenya Red Cross on Monday donated foodstuffs to counties that are highly affected by severe drought. West Pokot County is among the 23 counties currently experiencing severe drought. Inter-community conflicts have also increased as communities continue to fight for the little resources available. "Recently, inter-community conflicts have also increased mainly as communities fight for scarce water and pasture for their livestock," Kenya Red Cross said. Kenya Red Cross received support from the Italian Development Agency for the event. In a statement, the organisation said the food was distributed in collaboration with the West Pokot County government to the affected families. They were able to flag off food to 750 vulnerable people affected by both drought and conflict.
