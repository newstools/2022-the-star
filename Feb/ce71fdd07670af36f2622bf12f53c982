The Met Department in Kisii has advised schools to release children early due to rains expected in the region starting next week. Henry Sese, the meteorology county director, said some areas will experience floods and the safety of learners should be considered. Sese said children should not be allowed to play in the open while in school. He said due to flooded rivers, they should not cross temporary bridges. The county director advised residents to be cautious, while those in areas prone to landslides and floods move to higher grounds. He said the rains will be coupled with strong winds and thunderstorms in some parts of the region. “Do not shelter under trees for your safety,” Sese said on Monday. He said despite advisory on landslides, lightning and floods, residents do not heed the advise but carry on with business as usual. Sese urged those who engage in soapstone mining and quarrying activities, to abandon the businesses until the rains subside, to avert any deaths. He urged farmers to consult agricultural officers on the kind of farming to do in the prevailing weather. Sese advised the county government to open up drainage systems to minimise surface water runoffs and flash floods. He urged the agriculture department to advise people on soil conservation and plant indigenous trees to reduce environmental degradation due to soil erosion and increase forest cover. Sese urged motorists to ride and drive carefully to avoid or minimise accidents that might arise due to muddy and slippery roads. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
