ANC party has hit out at Cotu boss Francis Atwoli over what it termed as "incessant insults". The Musalia Mudavadi party in a statement on Tuesday said Atwoli and his 'cheerleaders' are trying to push Western Kenya into Azimio la Umoja which it said will never happen. "The inconsequential Atwoli and a bevy of his inane cheerleaders must wake up to the reality of our times that the Luhya nation will never be hoodwinked again to “steal political beeps” at the lake! Never!," the party said. Last week Atwoli met with Mudavadi allies who have now decamped to Raila Ondinga's Azimio la Umoja. The Unionist hosted Kakamega woman Rep Elsie Muhanda, Butere Mp Tindi Mwale, Lurambi Mp Bishop Titus Khamala Kwisero Mp Christopher Aseka and former Shinyalu MP Anami at his Ildamat home in Kajiado. According to Atwoli, the MPs came for a political consultative meeting. In its statement, ANC party said Mudavadi will continue in his mission to liberate Mulembe nation despite Atwoli's insults. "No amount of incessant insults and pedestrianly-sycophantic public display by the Atwoli and ilk mercenaries for hire will deter Musalia Mudavadi’s resolve to liberate the Mulembe nation from the political entanglement of a state project," the party said. "As for Natembeya and his adolescent-like pronouncements, be reminded that immature political orgasm will very soon be silenced by the unstoppable Mudavadi earthquake"
