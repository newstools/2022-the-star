Limuru MP Peter Mwathi has rubbished Deputy President William Ruto’s calls to Mount Kenya leaders to join UDA. Mwathi said Ruto wants to form a single party instead of a coalition with the Mount Kenya parties. Ruto has come under sharp criticism from a section of the region's leaders who describe the move as an attempt to kill the Jubilee Party influence in Mt Kenya. Mwathi decried that some MPs, senators and MCAs who were elected on a Jubilee ticket have ditched the party for other formations. The Limuru lawmaker said the defectors betrayed Uhuru and the party. “We started the journey together but some of us dropped off," he said. "It is also sad that our Dp formed a new party and he is blocking Mt Kenya region from forming a coalition with UDA for selfish interest. This is not democratic at all and our people can't see it." “How can people of this region ditch Uhuru’s party, to join an outfit that came just the other day?” he said. He spoke on Tuesday at St Benedicts gardens in Tigoni, where he welcomed other politicians to join Jubilee. Among them were John Mugwe, head of delivery in Kiambu county, former TNA coordinator Gladys Chania and George Maara among others. Mwathi who has been active in supporting Uhuru and Kieleweke team, declared that he will defend his seat on a Jubilee ticket. He said that the nomination will be free and fair. Maara  who lost to Mwathi in Jubilee nominations in 2017, has thrown his weight behind the incumbent and said he is eyingm the Kiambu Senate seat. Others eyeing the Senate seat include Mugwe, former Kiambu speaker Gathii Irungu and former MCA Mutonya Njenga. Mugwe said Jubilee has overcome greater political waves in recent past but it will still win most of the seats in the Parliament and Senate. “A lot of politicians and analysts think that Jubilee is dead and forgotten, but the party is now strong and will continue getting stronger,” Mugwe said.
