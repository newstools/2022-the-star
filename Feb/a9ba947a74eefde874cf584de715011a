If the   opposition leader Raila Odinga becomes the fifth president on his fifth attempt in the August 9 polls, then number five  will stand out as his incontestable lucky number. On a Friday afternoon, February 5, Raila and five other detainees including this writer were released from detention by former President Daniel Moi at State House. The gesture coming hot on the heels of condemnation civil liberty abuses was part of a deliberate effort to demonstrate to the international community that Kenya’s human rights record was not as bad as previously perceived. Like Jomo Kenyatta in the Kapenguria Six trial in the colonial times, Raila could probably emerge from another five prisoners to ascend to the throne against stiff opposition from within the government of President Uhuru Kenyatta. Rebellion of monumental magnitude that has rocked the ruling party for four years is led by no lesser person than Deputy President William Ruto and a one time ally of his opposition rival for the top seat, Raila. The historic reconciliation between Raila and Uhuru on March 9, 2018 infuriated Ruto and supporters who are on a mud smearing campaign against his boss and friends.
