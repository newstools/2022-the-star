The China Road and Bridge Corporation is beautifying the Nairobi Expressway by vertically planting flowers on its concrete pillars. This is a great idea but unfortunately they have chosen completely the wrong plants. They are planting marigolds and geraniums, exotic flowers that die after a single season and then need to be replanted. It will not be cost-effective to keep replacing them every six months. Moreover, they are not indigenous as they originate in Central America and the Mediterranean. It would be more sustainable and ecological if the Chinese contractor planted perennial indigenous plants on the pillars. For instance, Kenya is famous for its magnificent succulents and aloes that are drought-resistant and produce beautiful flowers. They need minimal soil to thrive and virtually no maintenance. Similarly around 2,600 trees have been cut down during the construction of the Expressway and government has pledged to plant 3,000 trees to replace them. Let all of those new trees be indigenous species like Meru Oak and Cape Chestnut from Kenya rather than the typical Jacarandas from Brazil or Grevillea from Australia. Beautification of the Expressway is commendable but let all the new plants and trees be indigenous. Quote of the day: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit.
