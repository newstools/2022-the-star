I bet you have heard of the reaction feature on Facebook. The good news is that WhatsApp might integrate the same feature for the its users. Although it has been rumored that the company has been working on this update for a while now, WhatsApp sleuths at WABetaInfo say that this new feature will be tested on the beta app first. “WhatsApp is readying message reactions (secured by end-to-end encryption) in a new upcoming update of WhatsApp beta for Android and iOS,” they say in a tweet. Rather than typing up a reply, just like Facebook, users will get to react to individual messages with (thumbs up, crying, laughter, tearful, love heart, shocked and pray). Currently, this feature is being tested in the beta version of WhatsApp, where later it might get rolled out to the world. The beta program is currently full, meaning the app is not ready for production yet and that the number of testers for the app has reached the desired limit.
