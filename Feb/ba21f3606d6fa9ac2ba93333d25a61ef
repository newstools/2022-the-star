Two children, aged six and 12, watched as their mother poured paraffin on their father and set him alight in 2015. They watched his skin peel away under the crackling flames. He rushed to escape through the front door but it was locked. He died three days later. The children and their father's family are still bitter and traumatised. On February 8, their mother was sentenced to 15 years in prison by judge Mary Kasango. But she will only serve eight years and five months as she was in remand for six years and seven months. The murder took place on June 10, 2015, when the woman was arrested. The children were awakened by their parents' quarrel. They watched as their mother carried a container of paraffin, poured it on her husband who was in a chair. He put out the matches on the first two tries. On the third strike, the paraffin caught fire. The judge said  despite the accused being a remorseful first-time offender, a prosecution report revealed her mother-in-law and siblings are traumatised and bitter. The children too are bitter. Kasango said the appropriate sentence is 15 years' imprisonment, as the woman has been in custody since 2015. "I therefore hereby sentence MWM to serve 15 years imprisonment. She shall be given credit for the six years and seven months she has been in custody while awaiting trial," the judge ruled. The victim was admitted to the hospital with third-degree burns over 70 per cent of his body. He died after three days. In his dying declaration to his family members, the man said his wife intended to kill him and their children. In mitigation, the accused said she was remorseful and contrite. She said she has been rehabilitated while in prison awaiting trial. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
