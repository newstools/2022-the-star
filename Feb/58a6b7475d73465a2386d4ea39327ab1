Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has expressed willingness to work with the One Kenya Alliance. In a statement after a meeting with Oka leaders on Sunday, the MP said they discussed a myriad of issues including the possibility of working together. Leaders present were Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka, UDP' Cyrus Jirongo and Narc-Kenya's Martha Karua. Kanu Executive Director George Wainaina represented Senator Gideon Moi. Kuria said he was invited to join the Oka, a move he is willing to heed but under one condition; they don't join Azimio La Umoja. He said his policies and that of his Chama Cha Kazi party dont marry with that of the Azimio la Umoja led President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "They invited Chama Cha Kazi and me to join the One Kenya Alliance. Whereas we share many ideals between Chama Cha Kazi and OKA, we agreed to work together as long as OKA is not joining the Azimio Coalition which is incompatible with me and the Chama Cha Kazi Party," Kuria said. He revealed that they will have a follow-up meeting on Wednesday to deliberate more on working together as a team. The developments raise eyebrows considering Kalonzo on Friday announced entry to the Azimio La Umoja. Kalonzo expressed willingness to work with Azimo even as he said talks have been launched to that effect. The Azimio team and Oka had reportedly scheduled the signing of the grand coalition agreement on Monday, February 28. It remains a matter of waiting and seeing, whether OKA will seal a deal with Azimio or Kuria's entry into the equation will spell doom to Raila's fifth stab at the presidency.
