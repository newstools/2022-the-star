The national government is rehabilitating dilapidated water projects in semi arid Suba North constituency in Homa Bay to end perennial water shortage. The Ministry of Water Irrigation and Sanitation is revamping the Kamato water supply project and Ogando water pan in Lambwe ward after more than 20 years hiatus. The Sh4.5 million Kamato water project will cushion up to 3000 households from water shortage. The project will be solar powered. It will supply water to Kamato primary and secondary schools  and villages of Kamato Gul, Kamato Central, Oundo and Ojawo. Speaking when he commissioned the project on Sunday, Water Secretary Samuel Alima said the government intends to end perennial water shortage in the arid area. Kamato water supply project was started in 1986 by the Lake Basin Development Authority. It was designed to supply water to school. “It will be completed within two months, the project can generate 10,000 litres of water per day,” Alima said. Alima called on residents of Lambwe to make good use of the projects once it's completed. “Besides using the water for domestic use, there will be surplus to support agriculture through irrigation.  We want people to use the water for subsistence and commercial farming,” Alima said. The ministry is undertaking other projects in Lambwe such as the Ogando borehole and water pan at a total cost of Sh9.3million. The Ogando water projects will help more than 4000 households “There is need to have sustainable water supply in the area to address such problems,” he said. Kamato water project chairperson Marry Mbeo said the area has been in dire need of water. She said many have been trekking long distances in search of water. “We ask for more water projects to improve our economy, people can’t keep livestocks without the availability of enough water,” Mbeo said. Lambwe West location senior chief Daniel Obure said his office will ensure the project infrastructure will be safeguarded from theft.
