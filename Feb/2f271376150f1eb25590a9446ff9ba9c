Eggs are a great source of proteins, vitamin A, D, E and B12. Not only are they affordable but they're also incredibly versatile. They can be incorporated in so many meals, desserts and drinks included. That's why most people prefer having a stock of them in the house. Have a crate of eggs but don't intend on using all of them at once? It's advisable to take a minute or two to turn each egg upside down and arrange them in the crate before storing them in the fridge. That means having the pointy end of the egg facing downwards. Storing eggs upside down helps them last longer as it prevents the air inside the egg's shell from getting into contact with the yolk. What most people don't know is that at the bottom (blunt end) of the egg there is an air sac which grows bigger as the egg gets older. And the egg shell has thousands of tiny pores that allow air to seep inside. These pores, allow chicks to be able to breathe inside the egg before they're hatched. Air is lighter than any of the other contents inside the egg, if you store an egg with the blunt side down the air sac will be at the bottom thus allowing it to push up against the egg whites and yolk as it rises to the top. This might be harmful in a number of ways. For instance, the air pocket may have potentially harmful foodborne bacteria such as salmonella which could cause an egg to spoil faster. Keeping the egg overturned ensures that bacteria is kept away from the egg yolk thus unable to grow or thrive increasing your egg's shelf life. This is helpful for people who enjoy their eggs runny or preparing ice cream/ mayonnaise with them as there's no sufficient heat to guarantee that the bacteria will be killed.
