The Prince of Wales has tested positive for Covid-19 and is now self-isolating, Clarence House has said on Twitter. Prince Charles received the positive result this morning and has postponed the unveiling of a statue in Winchester. On Wednesday, he and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall met people at a reception in the British Museum. This is the second time the 73-year-old has contracted coronavirus after he reported mild symptoms in March 2020. Charles had been due to unveil a statue of Licoricia of Winchester, a medieval Jewish businesswoman who was a money lender and single parent in the Hampshire city. Clarence House said His Royal Highness was "deeply disappointed not to be able to attend... and will look to reschedule his visit as soon as possible".
