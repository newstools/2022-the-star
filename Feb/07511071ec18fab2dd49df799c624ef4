Eight people have been rushed to the hospital after a trailer exploded with gas cylinders at Mai Mahiu road. Four private cars were among those reduced to ashes by the huge fire. Orange flames and black smoke billowed from the burning vehicles as a crowd mulled around the area to witness the incident. Witnesses stood at a distance as the trailer smoldered, reducing everything in its vicinity to soot and ashes. Limuru OCPD Anthony Gitonga said the trailer had crashed at the scene partialy blocking the road and rescuers rushed to attend to it. “As they were trying to raise the tanker, there was a leakage that led to a huge fire incident," he said. "We have eight people in hospital with multiple injuries." Gitonga added at least three trailers and six other vehicles were burnt in the incident. Police were among those at the scene earlier on trying to raise the truck that had blocked the road before it burst into flames. Pictures taken from the scene showed the lorry in huge flame which also caught several cars there. Several emergency teams were sent to the scene. Limuru sub county police commander Eilen Mola said the tanker was transporting gas to Kisumu, when it developed mechanical problem.
