ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi-led has responded to Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua's remarks that he will not be picked as Deputy President William Ruto's running mate. In a statement on Monday,  Mudavadi, through his Secretary-general Simon Gikuru, said Gachagua has no powers to speak for their Kenya Kwanza Alliance. "Rigathi Gachagua has no authority to speak for Kenya Kwanza on the matter hence his sentiments are premature, untimely and unwarranted, " he said. Mudavadi added that the alliance has not decided on its presidential and running mate candidates. "This will happen and be unveiled at an appropriate time by our principals Musalia, Ruto and Moses Wetangula." On Monday morning, at an interview with Citizen TV,  the Mathira MP said Ruto’s running mate will come from the Mt Kenya region and the deal was already sealed. Gachagua said the ANC party leader was privy to the discussion. "We have our NDC on March 15 to unveil our candidate William Ruto and other things will follow," he said. "But as far as I'm concerned Ruto is a presidential candidate and the running mate will come from the mountain at an appropriate time." Gachagua said Mudavadi and the Kenya Kwanza leaders were aware when they were joining the alliance. "When they came for discussion we were very fort-right because we are honest people. They were told that we agreed that running mate is from the mountain (Mt Kenya region)," he said. "We don't want to con someone. They will not be running mates."
