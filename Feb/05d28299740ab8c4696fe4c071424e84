These tasty treats are perfect as appetizers, breakfast, or tea snacks. They’re pretty easy to prepare and incredibly scrumptious with crispy undertones on the top, and a soft inside. The sweetness of the sweet potatoes contrasts with the flavours of the onions and spices to create the perfect sweet yet savoury treat. Ingredients Method Thoroughly wash and peel the onions and sweet potatoes. In a large bowl grate the sweet potatoes and then chop the onion into the bowl. Note: if you’re having a hard time grating the sweet potato you can boil it for a few minutes to slightly soften. Then cut it into pieces and grind it with a food processor together with the onions. Using a light cloth add both the grated sweet potato mixture, in the cloth, squeeze out as hard as you can the excess water and starch from the mixture. You can do this with your hands as well if you don’t have a clean kitchen cloth. Note: you can’t really extract a lot of starch and liquid from the sweet potatoes, so don’t worry if nothing much comes out from the mixture. Add the spices to the bowl and mix them together with the grated onion and sweet potatoes. Pour oil (enough for shallow frying) into a cooking pan and heat it over medium heat. Take a handful of the sweet potato mixture and flatten it with your hands, not too thick, not too thin of the mixture. Then roll it over a bowl of breadcrumbs then using a spatula, lower them in the heated oil. Cook each side for 3 mins, until golden and slightly brown on each side. (Sweet potatoes take a little bit more time to cook, so be careful not to undercook the pancakes) Set on a tray with paper towels to cool and drain off excess oil. Garnish with chives or coriander and serve with your choice of dip or sauce.
