Mombasa businessman Suleiman Shahbal has promised to remove the Sh1,200 that tuk tuk drivers pay every month to the county if he is elected governor in August. Mombasa has more than 5,000 registered tuk tuks. The county government charges the tuk tuk operators Sh1,200 as parking fee, but they have been complaining that the amount is too high. They have also been complaining of daily harassment by the police and the county askaris. “I have heard your complaints. I understand the importance of this industry and the contribution you make to this economy,” Shahbal said. Shahbal said tuk tuk drivers should not be harassed because of the monthly charges. “If you lock out the tuk tuk drivers, who contribute a lot of money to this economy, will you get alternative jobs for them? If you elect me, I will scrap these fees that you pay every month,” he said. He was speaking during the swearing-in ceremony of Coast Tuk Tuk Association new officials on Thursday afternoon at Makadara grounds. Association's new chairperson Benjamin Juma accused the police of harassment on the road, saying some misuse their authority. “Tuktuk operators have become slaves on the roads because of the continuous harassment by some police officers. We ask the police to desist from that,” he said. Coast regional traffic commandant Peter Maina admitted that there were some rogue officers on the road. However, he challenged the tuk tuk operators to follow the traffic rules to avoid confrontation with the police. “It is true we might have some rogue officers, but a number of tuk tuk operators do not have licences and pick and drop passengers at undesignated points,” Maina said.
