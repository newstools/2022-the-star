Former Kenya Simbas International Max Adaka and referee Victor Oduor have attained World Rugby Level II coaching certificates. The two coaches now join the likes of Kenya Lionesses and Nakuru RFC coach Felix Oloo, South Coast Pirates coach Kevin Amiani and KCB assistant coach Dennis Mwanja on the list of coaches who recently got their World Rugby Level 2 coaching certifications. “Congratulations to Max Adaka on attaining his World Rugby level 2 coaching accreditation,” Kenya Rugby Union announced. The World Rugby level II coaching touches on several pre-requisites including laws of the game, concussion management, key factors analysis, functional role analysis, and coach diary entry among others. Adaka had a stellar career having previously played for KCB, winning two Kenya Cup titles before joining Kabras in 2016 and leading them to their maiden Kenya Cup the same year. Oduor also holds World Rugby refereeing Level 3 accreditation. Oduor, a graduate of the Matties Referee Academy in South Africa, was among the match officials for the 2018’s Africa Gold Cup that also acted as qualifiers to the 2019 Rugby World Cup slated for Japan. In 2016, he was nominated by Rugby Africa for consideration as a  match official for the 2016/2017 HSBC Sevens World Series. Apart from officiating in the Kenya Cup and National Sevens Circuit, Oduor has also taken charge of some of the World Rugby’s Junior World Trophy matches. Elsewhere, the Kenya Cup clash pitting Homeboyz Rugby and Impala Saracens has been moved from the KCB Sports Club in Ruaraka to the Jamhuri Showground starting 3 pm and not 1 pm as early announced. Changes have also been made to the match between Mwamba Rugby Club and Nondies. The match was originally scheduled for 3:00 at Jamhuri Grounds but it will now be played at 1:00 PM.
