Industrialisation CAS David Osiany has said he will not resign, putting to rest talks that he will be contesting for Rongo MP seat on August 9. Osiany, on his official Facebook page, said he will not resign from the Ministry of Industrialisation and Trade, a decision which he said was a “patriotic burden of making hard decisions.” He said, “After the depth and span of consultations, there is convergence of opinion to stay out of the Rongo MP election and instead continue performing critical government assignments.” “This decision will definitely disappoint many of our ardent supporters." He said although he lost to incumbent MP Paul Abuor in the last general election, he has been active in the constituency and will continue doing so. Meanwhile, Seth Odongo a Mombasa county executive has resigned to run for Migori governor. “It has been a great honour with deep pleasure to serve the people of Mombasa with dedication. I will leave with my head up and a satisfied heart that I gave my very best with all challenges I faced,” Odongo posted on his Facebook page. All eyes are on 20 civil servants in Migori county who have been active on social and political functions selling their candidature bids for various seats ahead of August 9 general elections. A letter dated January 19 asked all Migori staff who are seeking elective seats to resign by February 9, which is exactly six months before the next polls. Section 43 of the Elections Act, 2011 says “public officer who intends to contest an election under this Act shall resign from public office at least six months before the date of elections”.
