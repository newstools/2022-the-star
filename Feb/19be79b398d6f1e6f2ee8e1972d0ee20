IEBC's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee has summoned Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege over her recent utterances regarding the 2017 presidential outcome. The utterances were made at a public rally in Isibuye in Vihiga County on  February 10, 2022, during the Azimio la Umoja Movement mobilisation rally. In a statement on Friday, the commission's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee secretary asked the MP to appear before the commission's electoral code of conduct enforcement committee on Tuesday for interrogation. "YOU ARE HEREBY REQUIRED to attend the Offices of the Commission at Anniversary Towers 6th floor on the 15th day of February 2022 at 9 .00 o'clock in the forenoon for examination by the Electoral Code of Conduct." While urging residents to register in large numbers as voters so that they can vote in ODM leader Raila Odinga to be the fifth President, Chege ended up saying:  "Kule central nimeskia hapawengine wakisema hapa tuliwaibia, kuna kaukweli kidogo. Lakini mjue kama tulijua kuiba si ata hii tutafanya nini...alafu…alafu". Loosely translated as, 'In Central, I have heard here some people saying that we stole from them. There is some truth in that. They should know that if we knew how to steal then, why not in this? Will we not do something... then... then...then". The lawmaker went on to say that ODM Raila Odinga has gained the support of people all over the country who are not afraid to go above and beyond for him. "Wanafikiria hao ndio wajanja, lakini sisi tuko na watu. Na baba ametemba kwa watu na amekua the people's project na tunataka akue the people's president," she said.
