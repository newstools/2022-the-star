Arrow Bwoy and Nadia Mukami have unfollowed each other on social media. The two have not posted about each other on their social media handles since January, which is unlike them. Arrow has also deleted all but one post and photos on his Instagram account. The post promotes his new album. Nadia's page still has her posts. Her last post about Arrow Bwoy was shared on January 29. There was nothing on Valentine's Day. Nadia lost her baby last December. "We have been through a lot. We have our reasons as to why we keep our things to ourselves. We have our angel in heaven," she said. "I lost a child and grieved in private last year I didn’t make it anyone’s business!! Anyone in the question of my pregnancy, leave me the **ck alone."
