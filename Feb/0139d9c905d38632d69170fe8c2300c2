Reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors and Equity Bank (women) remain the teams to beat as the Kenya Basketball Federation playoff semifinals start this weekend. Sparks will fly at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium from 10 am on Saturday when the best-of-five series starts with Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) taking on Storms. The ports teams showed their intention of wrestling both the crowns after arriving early in Nairobi for the fixtures. Equity Bank will confront Zetech University Sparks, who stormed into their first semis. Sparks coach Maurice Obilo warned that the students, who were fifth last year, are going for nothing short of the national title. “We want to play in the finals and we are coming hard. We have some players who have been to the playoffs before and I can say there is maturity in the team,” said Obilo. “Their response will be key.” The first men’s semifinal match of the day, pitting reigning champions Ulinzi Warriors against Strathmore University Blades, is penciled for 2 pm. The soldiers, who will line up national team stars like Eric Mutoro, Victor Bosire and Valentine Nyakinda, remain the favourites. KPA men will wind up the show with a match against Equity Bank and the dockers’ coach, Sammy Kiki, said their aim is to win Game 1 and 2 in Nairobi and finish off the series in Mombasa.
