Livestock farmers in Gucha subcounty, Kisii, have been urged to take their animals for vaccination to control a skin disease outbreak. Subcounty veterinary officer Isaboke Matoki said the exercise is ongoing and will end next month. The vaccination exercise started on February 21. “I urge farmers to use this opportunity and take their animals for vaccination at designated points,” Matoki told the Star on phone. The veterinary officer appealed to the farmers to stop using quacks who purport to be veterinary officers from the county government to vaccinate their animals. He said if the quacks use the wrong vaccination drugs, they will be forced to spend more money to save the animals. “Farmers should question the quacks, know where they graduated from, whether they are registered and recognised by the Kenya Veterinary Board and other relevant bodies,” Motoki said. He urged farmers who buy animals from the markets, to obtain letters from chiefs, before transporting them. Motoki said some people steal the animals and sell them to unsuspecting buyers, who are arrested and charged with theft. The veterinary officer urged the buyers to take details of sellers, for easy follow up, in case the animals are found to have been stolen. He urged residents to ensure meat from butcheries is inspected and by public health officers to be safe for consumption. “If the meat has been stamped, it means it is fit for human consumption. People should not buy unstamped meat because they risk getting infected ” Motoki said. He appealed to residents to report businessmen who sell unstamped meat to the subcounty officers for quick action. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
