Tennis Kenya are planning to honour their legends during the centenary celebrations starting next month. TK vice-chairman, Francis Mutuku, said the celebrations will run from March 1 until the end of the year. Mutuku, who doubles up as National Olympic Committee of Kenya (Nock) secretary-general, said the celebrations will see the federation honour their legends including Paul Wekesa, Eno Polo, Susan Wakhungu, and Allan Cooper amongst others for their services of the game. “Over the past 100 years, we have had great players who have done the country proud and we want to celebrate their services to the game,” he said. Mutuku hopes the past generation of players can inspire the present crop of rising stars.  “We want them to share their experiences and if possible mentor some of our current generation to do well in future tournaments," he added. He said they will also be launching a tennis foundation to cater for the needy and upcoming players in the country.  “We want to use the foundation to spread the gospel of tennis to other counties. We believe there is a lot of talent in the country which needs to be nurtured,” said Mutuku. As part of the celebration, Mutuku expressed confidence that they can have between four to six public tennis courts in the country to cater for players. “I hope we can have the public tennis courts ready by the end of the year so as to give players from all backgrounds a chance to play the game they love,” he added. Elsewhere, Kenyan junior tennis players will be seeking to improve on their fortunes when the third leg of the ITF tournament gets underway today at Nairobi Club. Brandon Sagala, Liberty Kibue, Alan Kimathi, and Richard Ominde will be hoping to make amends after being bundled out early in the Under-18 category of the opening two rounds. Sagala is optimistic they can turn around their fortunes in the final leg of the competition.
