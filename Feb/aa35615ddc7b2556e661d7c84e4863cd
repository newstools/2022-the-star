Deputy President William Ruto has said he is now interested in serving for 5 years only, and not ten. While revisiting remarks by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who previously said he will serve for 10 years and hand over to him to also serve for 10 years, Ruto appealed to Kenyans to give him one term. He said after five years, Kenyans will decide whether they will add him an additional five years or look for another person depending on his performance. "Tumekua na mjadala ambayo rais wetu alituambia yake kumi na yangu kumi. Lakini mimi sitaki kumi, nataka tuandikiane hii ya miaka tano kwanza. Nikifaulu kufanya kazi kwa hii miaka tano mniongeze ingine. Nikishindwa mtafute mtu mwingine," Ruto said while meeting Nyeri residents on Monday. Loosely translates to: " There has been a debate on the president's remarks that he will serve for 10 years and hand over to me to serve for 10 years also. But I want to say, I dont want 10 years. Just give me five years first after which you will decide to give me an additional term depending on my performance". Ruto, however, exuded confidence that he will deliver on his mandate if given the one-term He said his performance will lead to voters giving him a second term in office. The DP pitched a tent in Nyeri county where he held meetings with area residents to listen to their grievances that they want his government to prioritise once elected. Ruto confirmed on Monday that he will hold similar meetings across the 47 counties.
