BBC Kyiv correspondent James Waterhouse says a Ukrainian government official has given an indication of the breadth of the Russian military action so far. The official says there have been cruise missile strikes launched this morning on Kyiv, as well as troop movements in Odessa to the south of the country. Troops have also been crossing the border in Kharkiv, about 25 miles from the Russian border, the official says. Early signs according to witnesses and government officials are that this is something quite large-scale, Waterhouse says. There are also multiple reports from local media citing Ukraine's Interior Ministry which says some of the missile strikes have attacked Ukraine's military missile command centres and military headquarters in Kyiv. Russia's defence ministry has denied attacking Ukrainian cities - saying it is targeting military infrastructure, air defence and air forces with "high-precision weapons".
