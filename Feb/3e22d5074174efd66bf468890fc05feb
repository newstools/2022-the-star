Gospel singer Size 8 launched her most anticipated gospel album titled 'Gospel anthem' on Sunday at an invite-only event at the Panari Hotel. Speaking to Word Is at the event, the mother of two said the album will be used to change the lives of many in society. Size 8's album has featured the likes of Gospel singer David Wonder, Peter Blessings, Pitson and 'Pombe' hitmaker Iyanii among others. Iyanii has a deeply spiritual side that Size 8 saw and she roped him in to do a collaboration with her on her latest album. "I felt the presence of God in the song, and asked him, "Wewe ni mtoto wa pastor?" Size 8 said. Iyanii responded, "No. But I was raised in a church and I know God." Size 8 continued, "This is a great gift, pray for this gift, I believe the star in him is great. "When I was a secular artiste, very few people saw the seed of God in me. People like Pastor Kelvin saw it. I'm not prophesying, but it is a fact, there is a seed of God in Iyanii. Thank you for being part of the album." Iyanii promised to do anything for God's purpose. "I told you one thing, I got you any day, any time. If there is anything that is going to build the gospel industry, I'm in for it. I'm doing this for God." On his collabo with Size 8, Iyanii said he did not do the song because it is Size 8 but to minister to people. "I told her, in as much as I have written the song, as long as it touches and ministers to people, I'm glad to see you guys vibing to it. It is an amazing thing and I'm humbled."
