Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli's wife Mary Kilobi Atwoli has fired back at allies of deputy president William Ruto for constant attacks in their political rallies. In a statement on Wednesday on her Instagram page, the KTN News anchor had a bone two pick with two vocal leaders of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance who she said have a penchant for invoking her name in their speeches. "It's hilarious that some politicians, the likes of Rashid Echesa and Didmus Barasa have continuously made this KILOBI name inseparable with their manifesto in their rallies," she stated. Kilobi went on to express her disappointment with the leaders for making her a punching bag in their bid to settle political scores with her husband, Atwoli. The TV journalist asked the group to focus on selling their agenda to Kenyans instead of constantly disparaging her yet she is not a political player. Kilobi told the leaders to use the rallies to highlight their development agenda to the people instead of attacking her "I know it sounds really nice but Kenyans are eager to hear the "great plans" you purport to have for them. Kumbe hamna sera? Uza Sera wadau wachana na Kilobi. She's not a politician neither do I have plans of contesting," Kilobi said. She added: "Ironically most guys who shout the loudest about Kilobi the "25-year-old" have been frequent visitors in Kajiado. And by the way mkae mkijua kejeli zenu zinanijengea ushuhuda wa kishindo!" DP Ruto rallies in Western Kenya this week was characterised by constant attacks at the Cotu boss who on Monday lashed out at the deputy president saying he won't make it to the top seat. It is his remarks that led to a host of leaders including the DP firing back at him in Kakamega, Bungoma and Trans Nzoia rallies. The attack, according to Kilobi, touched on her leading to her statement.
