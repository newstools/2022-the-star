Borussia Dortmund’s fading Bundesliga title hopes face another stern test this weekend when they take on surprise package Union Berlin, as they bid to stop champions Bayern Munich running away with a 10th successive crown. Without prolific top goal scorer Erling Haaland due to injury, Dortmund were thrashed 5-2 at home by free-scoring Bayer Leverkusen last weekend to fall yet further behind leaders Bayern. Dortmund now trail Julian Nagelsmann’s side by nine points, and the challengers’ task is not going to get any easier this weekend in the capital. “We will analyse things and push on with our development,” coach Marco Rose said after the Bayer defeat. “Setbacks are part of development, and we’re working on this. “We have to take the next steps together as a team. Consistency is the keyword.” While Union also suffered defeat last weekend at Augsburg, they have defied all expectations this term to sit fourth in the standings— higher than they have ever finished in their short history. Bayern’s relentless form has not made things easy for Dortmund. The champions have won 10 of their last 11 in all competitions, including a 3-2 victory over RB Leipzig last weekend. But that win came at a cost as goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer suffered an injury requiring knee surgery, and he has been ruled out for at least four weeks. Bayern travel to VFL Bochum on Saturday to face a team they thrashed 7-0 earlier in the campaign, where Polish striker Robert Lewandowski will be looking to add to his 24 strikes so far this term. Dortmund did get one over on Bayern this week after Germany central defender Niklas Sule agreed to join Rose’s side at the end of the season when his contract in Bavaria expires.
