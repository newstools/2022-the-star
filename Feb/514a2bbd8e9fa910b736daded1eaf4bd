Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya has offered to cater for the funeral expenses of the veteran football fan Isaac Juma Onyango. Onyango died on January 26, after he was hacked to death by an assailant who raided his home at night in Bunyenjere village, Mumias West, Kakamega county. Governor Oparanya pledged that his county government will foot the burial expenses and also educate three of his 12 kids who are in secondary schools. Juma's burial is set for Saturday, February 12. Juma's body will leave Mumias mortuary on Friday with a procession leading to Bukhungu Stadium and Mumias Complex respectively for viewing and paying of last respect. After viewing, the body will be taken to his home for a requiem mass and overnight vigil ahead of the burial the following day. Former Ketraco MD, Fernandes Baraza also pledged to assist in educating his three sons and two daughters. Barasa is eyeing the county's governor seat. Juma's death left Kenyans shocked with many eulogising him as a football fanatic who made matches enjoyable. He was an ardent supporter of Harambee stars and AFC Leopards. His wife told the media that the late was slaughtered to death over land conflict. "He told me he had issues over land in the area, and in case of his death, I should tell the authorities that it was because of a land dispute." Police said they arrested a suspect over the attack.
