DP William Ruto's digital strategist Dennis Itumbi  has vowed not to record a statement with the Director of Criminal Investigation about his mysterious abduction just before Christmas (see P21). He was abducted from a barbershop on Kiambu Road and later discovered naked and bruised in Kasarani. He claimed he had been tortured for six hours by police officers. There have been claims of disinformation. But it does seem clear that Itumbi was kidnapped against his will. Itumbi complained that detectives who came to visit him in hospital were interfering with his medical treatment. He said they should instead look for the kidnappers. But without a statement from Itumbi, the police will not be able to properly prosecute the case, even if they are not involved. By refusing to provide a statement, it makes it appear as though Itumbi is the one with something to hide. Itumbi should provide his statement to the DCI – whether or not he thinks the police were involved in his kidnap – and he can then share his statement with the public so that they can make up their own minds about what actually happened.
