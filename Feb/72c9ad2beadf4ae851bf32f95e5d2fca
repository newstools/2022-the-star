Police in Mwala, Machakos, have launched a probe into the bodies of two schoolboys retrieved from River Miu. Police said Paul Mwiyania, 5, and Nzioka Ngalatu , 7, had been reported missing. Their bodies were found floating at a stagnant water pond on the banks of the river at Kitie village in Mwala subcounty on Monday. The matter was reported to Mwala police station as a drowning incident under OB Number 15/28/2/2022 at 1128 hours. “The duo had been missing since 27/2/2022 after leaving Mwala Salvation Army Church at around midday, a search for them was fruitless,” the report read. The report was made by Kibau sublocation assistant chief Dennis Mua. According to the police report, the bodies were spotted floating and their clothes and shoes found at the river bank. “They are believed to have gone in to swim. Bodies with no visible injuries retrieved and taken to Machakos Funeral Home awaiting postmortem,” the report read. The incident happened barely a week after the body of Evans Omae Mochogu,32, was retrieved from Portland dam in Athi River, Mavoko subcounty. The body was retrieved on February 22 by the provincial administration with the assistance from local divers and Kasuitu slum residents. Athi River assistant chief Martin Ngomo led the operations that took close to four hours. Ngomo said the man whose body had been retrieved wasn't a resident. His identity was known after his national identification card was found in one of his pockets after the body was removed from the water. "Yesterday there was a body that was spotted floating on the dam at 4pm. We launched the retrieval process together with security agencies but suspended the operations at night," Ngomo told the Star shortly after the body was retrieved. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
