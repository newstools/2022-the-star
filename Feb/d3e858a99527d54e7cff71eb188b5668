Russia has announced it is limiting access to Facebook, accusing it of "censoring" Russian media. State communications regulator Roskomnadzor said Facebook had ignored its demands to lift restrictions on four Russian media outlets on its platform - RIA news agency, the defence ministry's Zvezda TV, and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru. Nick Clegg, the vice-president of global affairs at Meta, which owns Facebook, said the social media company refused a request from Russian authorities to stop fact checking the four media organisations. Moscow has been trying to exert tighter control over the internet and big tech for several years. It is not yet clear what Russia's restrictions on Facebook will involve. Moscow has previously slowed down the speed of Twitter.
