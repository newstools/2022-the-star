A man was arrested on Sunday in Kibwezi, Makueni County, for allegedly sodomizing his 12-year-old stepson. The 35-year-old man is said to have committed the act after they had taken dinner. "Narrating his ordeal to officers at Ulilinzi police post, the minor explained how the one man turned against him at night," the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said in a tweet. After the dinner, the suspect asked his stepson to share a bed with him only to force himself on the boy. In a statement, the DCI reported that the suspect ordered the boy to shower immediately and warned him against telling anyone about the ordeal. But the boy confided in his mother, who was away on that fateful night. "The mother escorted his son to make a formal report with the police," DCI tweeted. The suspect was arrested in Miangeni. The boy was rushed to a local hospital for examination and treatment. This incident came barely four days after a similar case was reported in Kibwezi Sub-county. A man is said to have defiled his 11-year-old daughter at a pathway along Mikuyuni Teachers area. So far, six defilement cases have been reported in Makueni in the past five days. Parents and caregivers have been urged to take note of the alarming trend.
