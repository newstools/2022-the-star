On Friday in Nakuru, Deputy President William Ruto denied claims by Muranga Woman Rep Sabina Chege that he and President Uhuru Kenyatta stole votes to win the 2017 elections. Chege’s remarks are unfortunate because they discredit the electoral process and reduce popular confidence that the August 2022 election can be free and fair. Chege belongs to the ruling Jubilee Party which fronted Uhuru and Ruto. She implied on Thursday that she knew how the 2017 election had been rigged and the same tricks could be used to help Raila. If that is the case, why didn’t she bring out this information before? The Supreme Court overturned the 2017 election result primarily because of the failure of the electronic transmission of votes which may just have been a technical problem. If Chege knew more, she should have told us then. Opinion polls give us a good idea of where the candidates stand. If the election result is radically different, then maybe there is a problem. But if election results are similar to the opinion polls, then probably the election is a fair reflection of the popular vote.
