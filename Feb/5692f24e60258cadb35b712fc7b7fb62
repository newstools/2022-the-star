It is all systems go for the 2021 KCPE and KCSE exams with the government assigning 242,406 teachers to supervise and mark the tests. The examinations will be conducted between February 28 and April 1 with police officers providing security countrywide. The Ministry of Education has officially laid out logistics and working formula for the 2021 national examinations. Kenya National examinations Council CEO David Njengere said Knec is adequately prepared to rollout the exams. Njengere said the measures are meant to reduce the risk of exam malpractice. To start with, subcounty directors and deputy county commissioners will be required to open the exam containers at the designated time. They will then distribute the materials to various exam centres. Education CS George Magoha warned the administrators against delegating the duty to open containers to any other person. "Some centre managers especially in Kamukunji, can make deals with the officers in uniform. If you find any, such officers should be swiftly removed to avoid leakage," Magoha said. Njengere urged the officials to take good care of the security padlocks. "In case of any challenges of the padlocks or the container during the examinations, it should be brought to the attention of Knec," Njengere said. The exam materials will then be handed over to centre managers in person, escorted by armed police officers."Education officers in liaison with TSC counterparts must ensure centre managers, supervisors and invigilators are briefed on their roles," Njengere said. The council has also initiated a command and call centre that will be used for communication and monitoring of the exams. The call centre toll free lines are 0800 724 900 and 0800 721 410. Knec has put in place programmes that will guide assessment of oral exams, distribution of materials during exams and return of answer scripts. This year the council registered 1,225,507 candidates in 28,316 KCPE examination centres as compared to 1,191,752 candidates in 28,467 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 33,755 representing 2.75 per cent. In KCSE exam, 831,015 candidates were registered in 10,413 centres compared to 752,981 in 10,437 centres in 2020. This reflects an increase of 78,034 representing 9.39 per cent. KCPE exam centres will be served from 491 distribution centres while KCSE exam centres will be served from 483 distribution centres.    -Edited by SKanyara
