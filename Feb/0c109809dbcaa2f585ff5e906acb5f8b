Three people among them a Form 4 student have been charged with attempted murder in a Garissa court. The student, MN, Josephine Mbula and Bernard Katana are accused of poisoning Garissa nominated MCA Teresia Queen. They allegedly mixed her prescribed syrup with poison on January 11. MN, a private candidate, has been Queen's house help since 2013. Katana is said to have used Ndunge to convince the house help to commit the offence. Mbula was arrested on January 15, Katana on 26 while the student was arrested at a later date in Mwingi, where the police believe she was hiding. Katana was arraigned on January 27 and the court detained him for five days. On February 2, all the three suspects were arraigned in court and the prosecution sought to merge their cases into one. Appearing before chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu, defence lawyer Nelson Mandela urged the court to grant them favourable bail terms since they have been cooperating with the investigators. Mandela said MN will sit her KCSE examinations in March and she needed to prepare. The prosecution did not oppose the request to have the accused released on cash bail, awaiting the hearing of the case. The trio was released on Sh300,000 cash bail. The hearing will begin on April 12. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
