Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho has dismissed Deputy President William Ruto's ability to deliver development to the people of Kenya if elected president. Speaking in Vihiga County where the Azimio La Umoja rally was organized on Thursday, the Mombasa county boss said the DP has demonstrated in the last 10 years how "incompetent" he is. He said Ruto will not achieve anything even if he is given 20 years in office. "Ruto has been in office for the last 10 years and we have not seen his efforts in Kenya's development. We want to support Raila Odinga for him to create a level ground for other communities to get a chance for the top seat," he said. Joho told Sabatia residents in Chavakali that Ruto has a penchant for making promises that he won't deliver. The Mombasa governor said they will face DP Ruto head-on if the situation forces in the event he continues disparaging the Head of State. "We shall force you to respect president Uhuru Kenyatta if you can't respect him," he said. On the same note, Suna East lawmaker Junet Mohamed said President Uhuru can't hand over the country to people who have looted public resources. He said the nation has been led by only two communities since independence and it's time for other communities to take over. Babu Owino on his part said Ruto cannot win the backing of the Western region since they are behind the ODM leader. "Ruto has been rejected in the Western region, the area is for baba Raila Odinga," Babu said. Edited by B. Marita
