Socialite Amber Ray has removed Jimal's name 'Marlow' from her back, a tattoo she had done in 2021 when the two were deeply in love. Amber Ray recently posted a video of a tattoo artiste working on her back, the same area Jimal's name was, suggesting the end of what they shared in common. Amber Ray captioned the video, "I don't regret the love I gave you because you probably needed it. F** you, tho!" In a Q&A session last year, Amber said she always wanted to have a tattoo of her lover’s name on her body. "My second tattoo is my husband’s name. I told myself if I find this person and really connect with him, I must get a tattoo of his name." After their fallout, she said she would replace the tattoo with a dragon.
