There was drama in Embu after policed arrested a 23-year-old man for cultivating bhang. Dennis Murimi was on Monday found with 77 stems of fully grown bhang ready for harvest and an estimated 200 grams processed and ready for use. While at Kavutiri police post, Murimi said he resorted to bhang farming because he is a user and it’s expensive to buy on daily basis. He also said after smoking, he is able to work on his land effectively, for long hours. “Bhang helps me work properly on my farm without it I am never effective in my daily duties,” said Murimi. Murimi urged the authorities to pardon him because he never purposed to cultivate bhang for distribution. “I urge government to forgive me because I planted bhang for my own consumption. This plant is similar to sugar cane in a homestead and I don’t see anything wrong with it,” Murimi said. He said he cannot attend to any of his daily duties without using bhang. Gaturi North senior chief Nicasio Nyaga said they were informed by members of the community policing before police accompanied them to Murimi's home. Meanwhile, Nyaga decried the increase in drug abuse among the residents and urged community leaders and the police to work hard in curbing the problem. “Our teenagers are abusing drugs and that is why we are experiencing increased arson attacks in boys and girls’ schools,” Nyaga said. He urged the local authorities to conduct door-to-door searches to flush out bhang dealers and bring them to book. Murimi is being held at Kavutiri police post awaiting arraignment.
