Sweet potatoes are not only healthy and loaded with nutrients but also incredibly flavourful and a versatile meal. You can eat sweet potatoes whole or peeled and the leaves of the plant are edible too. They can be mashed, deep fried or baked depending on the meal of choice. They're high in fibre which means they can help promote a healthy digestive system and in turn help one lose or maintain weight by keeping one feel full for longer. Sweet potatoes are also good for eye health and help support immune function as they're rich in beta-carotene. Below is a healthy sweet potato recipe for your breakfast. Ingredients Method Thoroughly wash the potatoes then add them to a cooking pot filled with water. Allow them to boil until they're slightly soft. Use a fork to poke them to check if they're ready. Once ready, allow them to cool then peel and dice them into preferred sizes. Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil and brush it with butter then lay the chopped potatoes on it. Sprinkle cumin and black pepper over them and bake them. Note: Boiling before baking ensures that the sweet potatoes are well cooked and crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. As they bake, boil the eggs under medium heat. Once they're ready, allow them to sit in cold water for a while so as to make removing the shell easier. Take the sweet potatoes from the oven and set them aside. Remove shells from your eggs and place them on a plate. Serve, garnish as desired and enjoy the meal with your hot beverage of choice.
