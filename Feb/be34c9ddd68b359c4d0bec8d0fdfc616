The Ministry of Health is on the spot over massive spending irregularities during the Covid-19 period as the Auditor General cast doubt on expenditures of Sh8.4 billion. Of these, Auditor General Nancy Gathungu said Sh3.4 billion was over-commitment for Johnson & Johnson vaccines, Sh1.6 billion was spent on refugee assistance and Sh2.3 billion spending was above the approved budget. Also flagged in the audit for 2020-21 is Sh384 million spent on Covid-19 testing kits and Sh300 million on co-financing to access vaccines under the Gavi vaccines plan.
