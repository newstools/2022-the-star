Blueberry and oranges go so well, especially in pastries. Each has a distinctive flavour but neither overpowers the other. This is an easy blueberry orange scone recipe topped with a sweet orange glaze. They can be served for breakfast or as snacks. Ingredients Glaze Method : Preheat the oven to 200 degree In a large bowl, add flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and the grated orange rind and mix till well combined. Cut your butter sticks and add them to the bowl, mix until the pieces are pea-sized. In a different bowl, break the eggs and add sour cream. Beat the mixture using a fork, until well combined. Then add it to the bowl with dry ingredients and combine until moistened. Add the blueberries and mix briefly to fold them in. Line your baking pan with parchment paper, sprinkle some flour on top of it. (This is to help avoid the batter from sticking to it.) Then scoop the batter into medium-sized circles and place them on the leaving space in between each scone as they expand during baking. Bake until lightly golden brown, which should roughly be about 20 to 25 minutes. Note: Glazing the batter before baking will give a crunchy sweet outer layer to your scones. But if you prefer them softer on top add then stick to glazing after baking. Once ready, take them out of the oven and set them aside to cool a little. In a small bowl, combine the orange juice with the powdered sugar till well mixed and smooth. Drizzle over the cooled scones, serve and enjoy with a beverage of choice.
