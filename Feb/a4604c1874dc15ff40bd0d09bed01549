Nairobi Metropolitan Services will redevelop 60,000 affordable housing units in phase two of the programme. In a statement, NMS housing deputy director Marion Rono said they have started the redevelopment of 10 estates. The estates marked for upgrade are Woodley, Bahati, Maringo, Jericho, Lumumba, Ziwani, Embakasi, California, Kariobangi and Bondeni. NMS had earlier said,  jointly with the Nairobi county government, they would soon break ground for 10 other projects for affordable housing. As part of the redevelopment plan, the Bahati estate will have 12,000 high-density storied buildings of between six and 16 floors. They will consist of three, two and one-bedroom units to replace bungalows in the 20.4 hectares estate. Another 6000 units will be set up in Woodley estate, Bondeni (774), California (2,500), Lumumba (10,000), Maringo (8,000), Kariobangi North (1,500) and Embakasi (4,000) Phase one of the project continues to take shape. A selection exercise happened last month, with 48 original tenants choosing their houses. The tenants of Pangani will be part of the first group that will take ownership of the new units. In May 2020, each of the tenants received Sh600,000  to facilitate their resettlement rent for two years as construction works continued. Each tenant will be allocated a new house, they will pay Sh8, 000 monthly for 30 years. David Sirma, of Technofin which is the developer of the project said the apartments are divided into two, where the affordable housing ones have 952 units and the commercial ones with 610 units. As part of the affordable units, social amenities will be set up within the compound. Infrastructure services like water have been addressed with sufficient water supply storage being factored in two-level basements. A basement parking in the courtyard with playgrounds and a supermarket will be set up. Pangani being the pilot project is estimated to cost Sh5 billion, on 5.2 acres of land It is among seven estates that are under the affordable housing project in Nairobi, Jevanjee, Ngong road, Suna Road estates, Uhuru and Inspectorate staff quarters. The official groundbreaking of the Pangani estate was to happen in August 2018 but was postponed to December the same year when President Uhuru Kenyatta was expected to launch it. The project commenced on May 18, 2020, and was officially launched by President Kenyatta on June 30, 2020. Construction works on 1,900 units are underway at Jevanjee estates, formerly known as Bachelor Quarters. The land had been occupied by 81 houses. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
