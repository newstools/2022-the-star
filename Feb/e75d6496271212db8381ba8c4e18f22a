Kenya is at the peak of its mango season, which are now in ample supply. Tired of blending or eating it as a fruit, here is a new way you can jazz up the sweet yellow fruit, that is rich in Vitamin C and fiber. A sorbet is a frozen dairy-free dessert made with sweetened fruit juice or purée, in this case, we will use a mango. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a pan, heat the sugar, salt and water until dissolved then set aside to cool. Step 2 Chop the mangoes in a bowl, blend the mixture of the syrup, adding the lime juice until a puree is formed Step 3 Put in a bowl, cover the mixture and put in the fridge for 5 hours Step 4 Remove from freezer, then blend. Step 5 Put back in the fridge for an hour, then scoop and serve. Enjoy with friends and family. (Alcoholic drinks can be added to the mixture in step 2, but proportionally) Or try with other fruits like pawpaw's, guava, bananas, watermelons, passion fruit, among other fruits
