President Uhuru Kenyatta has arrived at Al Wasl Plaza to grace the Kenya National Day at Expo 2020 Dubai. A total of 192 countries are participating in the 6 month-long world exposition whose theme is 'Connecting minds, creating the future'. The Dubai Expo 2020 which started in 2021 is the first World Expo hosted in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia region. Kenya, which has a stand at the Expo has been a major attraction with over 200,000 people visiting the pavilion. The President on Tuesday graced the opening of the Kenya-Gulf Cooperation Council states business forum in Dubai on the first day of his working visit to the United Arab Emirates. The President, who invited Gulf investors to set up shop in Kenya, said the country needed to adapt to what investors wanted and remove the bureaucratic red tape that undermined trade. Uhuru directed Kenyan Government officials to be at the forefront in facilitating trade to give the country a comparative advantage as an investment destination of choice. He emphasized that Kenya seeks to strengthen its trade with the UAE, noting that a wide range of goods and services that the UAE imports from other parts of the world could be produced and supplied by Kenya. "These include services such as hospitality and tourism, banking and financial services, ICT and data processing," he said.
