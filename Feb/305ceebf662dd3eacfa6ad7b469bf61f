More than 2,500 singles, widows and widowers from Bahati in Nakuru County were treated to an early Valentine's day on Sunday. Philanthropist Irene Njoki gifted the residents from all the five wards in Bahati with food hampers. They were also entertained in a gala led by gospel artist Shiru Wa GP. The beneficiaries danced to different gospel tunes until 6 pm after which Njoki and her team started distributing the food hampers. "Many people will go for night outs, disco parties and drinks, but I have decided to bring it here for you," she said. The men got Valentine's caps while women received scarves besides the food hampers they took home. A young widower, who has been hawking different items with a toddler strapped on his back, was given a trolley-cart for selling warm snacks. Njoki, who is vying for  Bahati parliamentary seat, promised to provide pro-bono legal services to widows who may be having inheritance problems. David Kamau was moved to tears by Njoki's act of kindness, saying that it was difficult to carry his wares around with the baby either on his back or chest. "When I first saw Kamau with the baby and a feeding bottle strapped on his waist, I thought of a way of helping him and his child," said Njoki. Kamau's wife died while delivering the baby, who is now one year old. Njoki urged residents to engage in mature and peaceful politics instead of mudslinging and insults. The philanthropist who has done several development projects resigned from the government on Tuesday to concentrate on politics.
