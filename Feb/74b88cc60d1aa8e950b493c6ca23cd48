TotalEnergies Kenya in partnership with Toyota Kenya has launched the second edition of the skill-based competition for motor vehicle mechanics in the country. The initiative which started in 2019 is aimed at equipping mechanics with engine oil knowledge, vehicle diagnostic and servicing skills. Dubbed "QUARTZ Golden Spanner Competition", it is scheduled to run until May 6. The winner will get a brand-new Toyota Hilux single cab pickup worth Sh3.2 million. The second and third finalists as well as the regional champions will be awarded Sh750,000, Sh500,000 respectively, while the 20 regional winners will each receive Yamaha YBR 125G motorbike to help grow their businesses. Eric Franchini, Total Kenya managing director said: "We recognize the immense potential of Kenyan artisans, especially in the automotive sector, and we are pleased to support them to grow their skills as they provide better services to their clients.” At least 191,000 mechanics registered for the competition across the country. Only 42 finalists were picked for a week’s boot camp at the Toyota Kenya Academy.
