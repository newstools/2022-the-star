The One Kenya Alliance has suspended the signing of a coalition agreement that had been scheduled for Monday, February 28. OKA team had planned to sign its coalition agreement on Monday before entering into a big deal with Azimio on the same day. The postponement of the signing of the OKA agreement now puts off the sealing of a grand deal with Azimio. Statement by the outfit's spokesperson Fredrick Okango on Sunday evening said the move is to allow for the accommodation of new interested parties that wish to join the One Kenya Alliance. "Our ideals continue to attract political formations which share the vision of a united nation anchored on the rule of law and equitable development. As a result, we continue to receive interests from the political formation that have expressed interests in joining us, " Okango said. And added: "As a result, we have rescheduled the official unveiling of the OKA coalition as well as the signing of the coalition agreement that was scheduled for tomorrow to a later date this week to allow the accommodation of our new parties." The suspension came hours after the calling off of a joint rally that was scheduled for Sunday together with Jubilee and ODM. Earlier on, Moses Kuria noted that he met with OKA and discussed possibilities of working together. He said he had expressed willingness to join them but on the condition that they don't work with the Azimio La Umoja.
