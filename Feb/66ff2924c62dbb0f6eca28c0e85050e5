President Uhuru Kenyatta has fired a warning shot at religious leaders and a section of leaders who he accused of being beneficiaries of corrupt money. The Head of State was addressing Mt Kenya delegates at Sagana state lodge when savagely attack as section of politicians for spreading lies and using corrupt money to woo churches to support their bid. In an apparent attack at his deputy William Ruto, Uhuru warned that those who have been using money meant for dams have their place in hell. Uhuru took on church leaders accusing them of being beneficiaries of proceeds of corruption. “Even church leaders should stop telling lies to our people. Let's tell the truth, you are being given 3 billion meant for Kimwarer and Arror dams meant for the children of God, then you come to mislead us,” Uhuru said. He chided his deputy for spreading lies and misleading the youths even as he called on Kenyans to choose wisely as the country heads to the August 9, polls. "Don't accept to be cheated. I will tell you the truth. I have no interest in this election except to tell our people that we should not go back where we came from," Uhuru added. It is during the same meeting that Uhuru endorsed the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. He said the opposition chief has the best interest of the country and urged the Mt Kenya region to back his bid. Uhuru suggested that he will have no problem backing Ruto in future, only if he reforms. "I'm asking you to support Raila Odinga as he means well for the Country. When "my young man reforms", we will consider him," Uhuru said. This is the first time President Uhuru was publicly telling his community that the ODM leader was his preferred successor. The President has been hinting at backing the ODM leader without mentioning it directly.
