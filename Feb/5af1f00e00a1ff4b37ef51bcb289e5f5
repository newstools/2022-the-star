Posta Rangers are set to announce the appointment of Salim Ali as their new head coach following the departure of Stanley Okumbi who will be traveling to Germany for a six-month coaching course. Speaking on Friday, Okumbi confirmed he had already cleared with the mailmen and ushered in Salim to take the reigns. “I have already handed over to Salim but the rest of the technical bench remains intact,” said Okumbi. “I'm proceeding to Germany to pursue a coaching course that is the equivalent of the UEFA 'B' license,” said Okumbi. The gaffer is currently in possession of two UEFA 'C' licenses as well as CAF 'B' and CAF 'A' qualifications. Okumbi deserts the mailmen at a time they are enjoying a splendid run in the Kenyan Premier League, where they are placed sixth on the log with 26 points. “I trust in Salim's ability to continue with the good job we had already begun. Posta have a good squad that can compete effectively for a decent finish in the current season,” said Okumbi. “The gap between us and leaders Kakamega Homeboyz would have been drastically reduced if we had not crushed to Gor Mahia in our last league encounter at Moi Stadium, Kasarani,” said Okumbi. Asked if he had any intentions of linking up with the mailmen at the conclusion of his training, Okumbi said that would depend on how talks between him and the management of the club transpire. “I don't really want to delve much into such discussion but then my return to Posta Rangers will be pegged on the outcome of our negotiations upon my return from Germany,” said Okumbi.
