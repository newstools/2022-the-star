The race for survival in the Kenya Cup hots up on Saturday with Homeboyz hosting Impala at the Jamhuri Park showground. The Deejays are placed ninth on the log with 11 points, two more than their opponents and it promises to be a cracker with the winners likely to stay in the top division come next year. Simon Odongo's charges have a youthful squad and will be keen to bounce back from their last outing where they lost 25-7 to Mwamba. Odongo, who seeks to win the battle up front and record a third win of the season, will rely on veteran Thomas Okidia, Joseph Amalemba, and Roy Wesonga. Mohammed Omollo, Augustine Lugonzo, Collins Shikoli, and Leonard Mugaisi will be the key actors in the backline. Impala on their part will be buoyed by their shock 31-14 victory over Mwamba a fortnight ago and head coach Oscar Osir will be gunning for a win to take his charges away from the relegation scrap. Duncan Ekasi, Elkeans Musonye, Nesta Okotch, and Paul Mutsami will be the key players in the pack as Nato Simiyu, Bill Omondi, Israel Soi, and Anthony Nyandigisi man the back. Fifth-placed Mwamba entertain Nondies in a tricky encounter at the same venue. A win will be key for both sides with only seven points separating them on the log. Mwamba gave champions KCB a scare last week before running out of gas to lose 39-30 and a similar performance against Nondies could inflict more misery on Kenya's most decorated club who are bottom of the standings with seven points Blak Blad welcome Quins to Kenyatta University as Nakuru host Masinde Muliro University.
