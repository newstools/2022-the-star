ODM party leader Raila Odinga has been on a charm offensive of Central Kenya, a region that has not supported him in the previous four elections. This time, the region unanimously agreed to give him a hand with president Uhuru Kenyatta saying 'yes' to a Raila presidency. Mt Kenya tycoons and top Maa community leaders have also inked a deal to rally behind Raila's bid to be president. The leaders met at the Safari Park Hotel where they signed an MoU to support Raila last week.
