Migori police have launched a manhunt for a lorry driver who escaped after a grisly road accident that left a man and wife dead. The parents were walking along Migori-Muhuru Bay Road in the Kababu area in the outskirts of Migori town, after taking their three-year-old girl to the hospital, when the accident occurred. The three-year-old girl survived. Locals said the lorry which was being driven at a high speed lost control, veered off the road and crashed on the three. “When we arrived at the scene, we heard the child crying. Her parents had been knocked to death,” Washington Opiyo, one of the family members said. Opiyo said onlookers rescued the minor as the driver left the vehicle and escaped on foot to avoid being lynched by the mob. “A grader had to move the lorry for the parents to be removed,” he said. Suna West Sub-County police boss Elizabeth Wakuloba said the bodies of the two Julius Oganda and his wife Miriam Adhiambo Ogonda were taken to Migori Referral Hospital mortuary while the minor is fighting for her life at the same facility. “The lorry in the model of a tipper was carrying sand and cement. It was headed towards Muhuru bay from Migori town. It lost control and hit the pedestrian who was also walking in the same direction,” Wakuloba said. The officer said that they have launched an investigation into the accident. “I want to urge all road users to be careful while using the road, we don’t want our people to lose their lives just because somebody is driving carelessly." This comes as police have also launched investigations over a hit ran incident in Awendo town when a speeding saloon car hit and killed a woman living with mental illness. Wakuloba called on road users to exercise caution when using the busy Kisii-Migori-Isebania road which is currently under expansion.
