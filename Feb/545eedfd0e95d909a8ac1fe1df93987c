Fuel prices will remain the same for the fourth month now, according to the latest review. A litre of petrol will retail at Sh129.72 in Nairobi, while diesel to go for Sh110.60 per litre. Kerosene to continue retailing at Sh103.54 per litre. The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has retained pump prices for petroleum products despite a drop in the landed cost. The landed cost of imported Super petrol decreased by 0.86 per cent from$601.97 (Sh68,276) (Sh71,206) per cubic metre in December to 596.79 (Sh67,825.18) in January. However, Diesel increased by 7.11 per cent from $565.92 per cubic metre to $606.16 per cubic metre. Kerosene decreased by 7.04 per cent to 534.38 (Sh60,732.29) per cubic metre. Last month, EPRA director general Daniel Kiptoo said the government will utilise the Petroleum Development Levy to cushion consumers "from the otherwise high prices." "The prices are inclusive of eight per cent VAT in line with provisions with the Finance Act and the revised rates of excise duty adjusted for inflation," Kiptoo said. This comes amid concerns by Oil Marketing Companies over government defaulting on compensation under its fuel subsidy initiative introduced mid-last year.
