Kajiado East MP Peris Tobiko on Tuesday had a rough time selling her governor seat candidature to Kimana residents in Kajiado county after she was booed. The MP had been ushered to speak by her rival in the governor seat contest Katoo Ole Metito, Kajiado South MP. She was met with resistance from the residents who had turned up to welcome them. Tobiko's frantic attempts to cool the crowd that had seemingly made up its mind against her proved futile. She was constantly interrupted, at each attempt, with pro-Katoo chants. Deputy President William Ruto who was standing in his vehicle watched pensively as the drama unfolded. “Nyinyi mumesema wenu ni Katoo, na nikimshinda? mtanipatia hiyo kura? (I can see you have endorsed Katoo, what if I beat him? Will you vote for me?)?” she posed. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance led by Ruto had pitched a tent in the area to drum up support for their camp. The MP was among a host of leaders who accompanied the DP and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula for campaigns. Tobiko has expressed her interest in Kajiado gubernatorial seat under the UDA party. Katoo is also eyeing the same seat on the UDA party ticket. In his earlier address, Katoo called for peace and urged residents to accommodate all leaders. He said he was ready to battle it out with Tobiko in the nomination adding that he will back whoever wins in the primaries. The DP was accompanied by Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula, Phillip Mpaayei (Kajiado Senator), Mary Seneta (Nominated), Rigathi Gachagua (Mathira), Kimani Ichungwa (Kikuyu), Linturi Kindiki (Tharaka-Nithi Senator) among others. The team also officially opened Ngusso Primary School tuition block funded by NG-CDF in Kajiado East. Edited by B. Marita
