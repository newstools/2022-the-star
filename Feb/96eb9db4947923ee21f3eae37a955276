A waffle is a cake-like pastry that is crispy on the outside yet soft and fluffy on the inside. It is made from leavened batter when it is poured between two hot, patterned plates. They come in a multitude of shapes and sizes and are widely enjoyed across the globe and their origin is traced back to France and Belgium. Waffles can be had for breakfast, brunch, afternoon tea, or as snacks. They're quite similar to pancakes as they both use the same ingredients. However  they usually have slightly more sugar than pancakes and unlike pancakes which are prepared on a pan or skillet, these are cooked using a two-sided, dual-heated griddle that’s well-greased. INGREDIENTS Method • Preheat waffle iron. • In a large bowl, add all the dry ingredients; flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt then stir them until well mixed. •In a separate bowl mix in the buttermilk, eggs, vanilla extract, and melted butter. Stir until well combined then pour the liquid mixture into the dry ingredients bowl. • Stir until everything is well combined and there are no lumps visible. • Pour the mixture using a ladle into the heated waffle iron. Note: The amount of batter you pour in varies based on the waffle iron being used. For perfect Belgian-style waffles use 1/2 cup of batter. Once ready take them out and repeat with the rest of the batter. Serve hot, garnish with your favourite syrup, a cup of beverage and enjoy.
