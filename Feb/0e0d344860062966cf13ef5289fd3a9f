Popular Swahili telenovela Selina is finally coming to an end. In a statement, Maisha Magic East said the popular telenovela will end in April after six seasons on air. The telenovela, which is currently at a Kenyan record of 935 episodes (and counting) premiered in January 2018. It has been one of the most-watched shows in Kenya in the past four years. In a statement shared with Sinema Focus, Margaret Mathore, Head of Channel, Maisha Magic East, said Selina is coming to a heroic end to pave way for yet another gripping local story. "Undisputed king of prime-time TV every season and is bowing out as the greatest, longest-running daily TV show in Kenya." "We have created stars, employed and upskilled hundreds of young creatives, touched and entertained millions of households for the last four years, and for us, the bar has been set high." Some of the famous stars of Selina include Pascal Tokodi, Celestine Gachuhi, Brenda Wairimu and Joyce Maina, among others.
