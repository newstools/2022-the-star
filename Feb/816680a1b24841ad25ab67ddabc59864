Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) are already in Nairobi ahead of their play-off finals clash against champions Equity Bank this weekend. The dockers women's coach, Anthony Ojukwu, said they are not taking any chances in the two epic ties at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. "We are already here and training hard for the two Nairobi games. We want to take what is rightfully ours," he said after yesterday's morning session at Nyayo. "I am having all my players here and the training is going on well since we arrived here on Tuesday. I have no injuries at all." He said he is having two daily sessions with the morning ones in the gymnasium and the afternoon one at the University of Nairobi courts. After the Nairobi games, the best of five games series will move to the Makande Welfare for games three and if need be four and five. "We want to start off on a good footing here in Nairobi before moving to our back yard for the rest of the fixtures. We are prepared." To book their finals ticket, KPA dispatched Storms 3-0 in the semi-finals. Equity Bank who are going for their third crown in a row also blanked Zetech University Sparks by a similar margin.
