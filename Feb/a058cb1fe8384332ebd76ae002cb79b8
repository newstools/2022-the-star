Consolata Hospital Kyeni has partnered with Equity Bank to boost development within the hospital. The mission hospital in Embu is the second to be elevated to Level 5 after Embu hospital. Equity chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe visited the hospital on Wednesday to discuss the partnership. The meeting was attended by Embu Catholic Bbishop Paul Kariuki and hospital managing director Fr Dominic Muriuki. Igathe said the discussions on the partnership are in preliminaries and it’s too early to comment on the matter. The chief commercial officer  also visited the theatre and maternity wings building which are under construction. Muriuki said the hospital is looking forward to bringing more partners on board to bolster development and improve it to a Level 5 hospital status. “We are happy today we hosted equity holdings chief commercial officer Polycarp Igathe and we’re looking forward to more,” he said. The hospital was elevated to a Level 5 in December last year after the hospital was inspected and approved of meeting Level 5 hospital standards. Among the reasons for elevation was the hospital infrastructure that has continued to improve each day. The managing director said the hospital is working tirelessly to increase the current infrastructure by adding more theatre and maternity wings to match and surpass the elevated status. “Any Level 5 hospital is obliged to have more than one theatre for obstetric emergencies and normal operations theatre and this remains our dedicated target,” he said. Muriuki said the hospital is hiring of more staff to match the growing hospital infrastructure and also the increasing number of patients. He said since December last year, the hospital has increased the number of patients from 30,000 to 32,000. The managing director said the increase is a clear indication of the vast number of health services seekers. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
