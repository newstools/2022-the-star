Killy, signed under Harmonize's record label Konde Music Worldwide, is set to release his debut EP, 'The Green Light'. Speaking to Word Is, the singer described the five-track EP as full of hit songs. "Everyone knows the importance of green light and I believe my label has switched on that light for me. I have been given the opportunity to go and shine. There's no red light for me," he said. His latest song, 'Ni Wewe', featuring his label boss Harmonize, has also been stricken from YouTube by a Kenyan producer. "Someone by the name Ian Mutisya, who claims to be a producer, took down the video, and my management is working on getting it back," he said. "I don't know his reasons, so if he wants to talk, let him look for me, we settle the issue." Killy was previously signed by Alikiba under his record label Kings Music before he left in 2020. "Music has a lot of challenges, reaching where I am has not been easy. I am a big artiste and I feel I should be on a big record label." "That, however, does not mean Kiba's'label was bad because that is why I worked with them in the first place." He opened up about not signing a contract at all with Kiba. "They made me and that is why when I came to Harmonize's label, I was accepted. I left because it was a personal decision. At Kiba's label, I did not have a contract so it was easy for me to leave." He continued, "I took a break, thinking about the next step to take, before I decided to settle on Harmonize's label. Alikiba and I are still on good terms and we still talk." Killy was in the country for a media tour.
