@ppcheti Lamu residents have asked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i to lift a curfew order that was placed on some areas a month back due to insecurity. On January 5, the CS declared a dusk to dawn curfew on disturbed areas in Lamu following a spate of attacks by assailants that left tens of people dead. The disturbed areas were parts of  Mpeketoni, Witu, Hindi, Mkunumbi, Hongwe and surrounding areas, all in Lamu West subcounty. Residents have requested the CS not to revise the curfew order as it ends this week. The curfew which ran from 6am to 6pm daily was to last 30 days. Hongwe MCA James Komu said the curfew had affected the socioeconomic lives of residents. He has called for the lifting of the curfew or for the hours to be revised. “This is the last week it's in force. The curfew hours have not been friendly to the economy. We are glad for the peace and tranquillity restored,” Komu said. Lamu businessman Elias Mwangi opposed any extension of the curfew. Mwangi has urged the government to seek alternative ways to resolve insecurity far from imposing curfews that directly impact people’s livelihoods and the local economies. “We pray the curfew won't be extended, if it must stay, let them revise the hours. An economy can't thrive under such directives,” he said. Residents urged the police and other security agencies to desist from using excessive force when enforcing the curfew. They also urged the government to deploy more security officers to Lamu instead of prolonging the curfew. “We ask the police to maintain good relations with residents to help the community,” Mpeketoni entrepreneur Maina Ngumi said. He said the good relationship, will enable residents to provide information, to help in the fight against insecurity in Lamu. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
