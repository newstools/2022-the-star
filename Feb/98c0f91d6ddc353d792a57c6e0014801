A class 8 pupil is receiving treatment at a health facility in Kitui county after a botched abortion attempt over the weekend. In a statement, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said the 16-year-old minor escaped death narrowly after she delivered a five-month lifeless male foetus. The minor was rushed to the hospital by her mother after complaining of severe abdominal pain, only to be discovered later that she was pregnant and had attempted an abortion. After interrogation, the girl later revealed that she had been defiled by her school headteacher and he was responsible for the pregnancy. Prior, the headteacher had taken her to a private clinic in Ishiara, on February 19 where she was asked to swallow some tablets. She later experienced abdominal pains that led to her hospitalization. This comes barely three months after President Uhuru Kenyatta called out men on molestation of young girls on World Aids day in Nakuru. “It is such a shame when, we as older men and leaders, see our children suffering because of such behavior. We must tell each other the truth because children are not doing this to themselves, it is grown-ups doing it,” Uhuru said. “Some older men are going out with girls who are even younger than their daughters; what kind of men are you?” he added. The DCI said they have launched a manhunt for the perpetrators and will be brought to book. “The headteacher and the owner of the clinic have gone missing but we have launched a manhunt for both of them,” DCI said.
