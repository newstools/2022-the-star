Stable global mineral prices could push up demand for titanium and other mineral concentrates leading to better revenues for Kenya, according mining company Base Titanium. The firm has cumulatively paid Sh5.7 billion in royalties to the government since it started commercial activities in the country, the firm’s books indicate. "Increased ilmenite supply from some African sources, Vietnamese exports and Chinese domestic production through 2021 continued to lag behind demand resulting in an expectation that ilmenite prices will maintain December levels through the March quarter,” the firm Australian firm with Kenyan operations says in its quarterly report. Currently Kenya is the third biggest titanium and concentrates exporter in the world, after South Africa and Mozambique– international trade data by the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) shows. Other top exporters include Ukraine, India, South Korea and Egypt. Titanium ores account for 65 per cent of Kenya's total mineral exports, according data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) show. The firm which has been mining titanium ores in Kenya since 2013, with the first shipment in February 2014, has China as its key market. It produces three key minerals at Kwale– Ilmenite, Rutile and Zircon, with a sales revenue per tone of $459 (Sh 52,142 ) in the just ended December quarter. Base started with a royalty rate of 2.5 per cent which it paid for seven years, as per the terms of Base’s Special Mining Lease, before it was recently increased to five per cent. The firm has been in agreement for a progressive increase in the royalty rates as it continues to mine in the country. “Cumulatively it is Sh5.7 billion,” General Manager External Affairs, Simon Wall, confirmed to the Star in a telephone interview. In the year ended June 30, 2021, Base made $198.2million (Sh22.5 billion) from sale of the three products, before tax and operating costs. During the fourth quarter (October-December), Base Titanium Limited made royalty payments to the government of Kenya totalling $18.8 million (Sh2.1 billion ) comprising catch-up payments to the June 2021 quarter, and payment of the September quarter royalty at the agreed increased rate. The Economic Survey 2021 indicates titanium earnings totalled Sh19.4 billion in 2020, a slight drop from Sh19.6 billion the previous year. This slight decline in value despite notable reduction in the quantity produced was as a result of 28.2 per cent increase in the average export price of the titanium ore and concentrates, KNBS notes. Total value of minerals produced in the country was Sh22.6 billion, down from Sh24.1 billion. Soda Ash is the second top earner for the country (on minerals) bringing in Sh1.6 billion, followed by Gold (Sh685.1 million), carbon dioxide (Sh455.2 million) with crushed refined soda(Sh178.7 million) closing the top five list. " Most of the major minerals recorded a decline in 2020. The total quantity of the titanium ore minerals produced declined by 9.5 per cent," Kenya National Bureau of Statistics notes in the survey. Soda ash production declined by 9.7 per cent . The decline is attributed to decrease in demand for minerals in the external market due to Covid-19 pandemic. Bulk freight costs to China eased through the quarter but remain volatile and are expected to affect ilmenite price gains for the foreseeable future. In the December quarter, ilmenite produced totalled 84,000 tonnes , rutile (18,400 tonnes) while zircon production was 6,400 tonnes. This was up from 72,900 tonnes (ilmenite), 17,800 tonnes (rutile) and 6,100 (zircon) in the third quarter. Sales for ilmenite more than tripled to 130,000 tonnes from 34,100 tonnes in quarter three. It targets to produce 73,000 to 83,000 tonnes of rutile, 310,000 to 340,000 tonnes of ilmenite and 24,000 to 28,000 tonnes of zircon in the financial year ending June 30. In the 2020 financial year Base Titanium paid over $32.5 million (Sh3.6 billion) in direct tax, royalties and VAT. During the last quarter (October-December), demand for imported ilmenite as a feedstock for Chinese Titanium dioxide pigment producers, particularly from the company’s customers, remained strong, enabling further ilmenite price gains. As at December 31, the company had net cash of $37.1 million (Sh 4.2 billion) consisting of cash and cash equivalents. Base is hoping the government will issue it with prospecting licenses to expand and extend its operations in Kenya, with more explorations targeted at areas in Kwale and Lamu. A Government of Kenya moratorium on the issuance of prospecting licences in November 2019 has affected the progress of all licence applications, as the government moved to renegotiate terms with miners in a bid to get more revenue.
