Reigning women’s champions, Equity Bank Hawks, pipped Kenya Ports Authority 53-51 in a hotly contested Kenya Basketball Federation playoff final Game One at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on Saturday. The bankers trailed 11-16 in the first quarter, but were up 13-12 in the second. KPA took the third 13-11 before succumbing again 18-10 in the last half. Equity Bank coach Sylvia Kamau hailed her charges for pulling through in the last quarter. "We started off slowly in the three quarters but came out strong in the last quarter by dominating the boards and denying them space," said Kamau. "We cut down their shooting and prevented them from taking second shots. We will need to continue doing that in game two." Betty Kananu sunk the game's winning basket and wound up with 12 points, same as Melissa Akinyi and Salma Akinyi. Natalie Akinyi shot 17 for KPA. Game Three will be held on Sunday with Hawks travelling to Mombasa where they might also play Game Four and Game Five.
