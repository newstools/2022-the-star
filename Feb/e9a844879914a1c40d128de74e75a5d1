A majority of Kenyans are feeling the pinch of the rising cost of living, according to the latest Radio Africa monthly opinion poll. According to the survey, 55 per cent of respondents feel unemployment was among the top challenges and 33 per cent listed corruption, as a result of weak governance, among the top problems the country was facing. The Radio Africa survey of 3,152 respondents was conducted by computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) between February 1 and 5 across all 47 counties. It carries a 1.75 per cent margin of error.
