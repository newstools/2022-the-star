Police in Migori are investigating suspected twin suicides on Sunday in separate incidents in Kuria West and Awendo constituencies. A student was found hanging in a school store in Awendo constituency, while a man died by suicide in Kuria West. On Sunday, learners at Ranen Adventist Secondary were shocked when they found one of their colleagues hanging from the ceiling in the institution’s store. Awendo subcounty commissioner Mercy Wamalwa said the student, who was an orphan, was quiet and nobody knew why he committed suicide. He did not leave a suicide note. “He used a manila rope which he tied to the rafters and hanged himself,” Wamalwa said. The body was taken to Rapcom mortuary. In Igena village, a man committed suicide in his bedroom after quarrelling with his wife over plans to marry a second wife. Villagers said Wilfred Gati Kimune, 33, had stayed away from his home for two days and when he came back his wife picked a quarrel with him. “She left for an errand and when she came back, she found the man dangling from an electric cable in his bedroom,” Joseph Chacha, a villager, said. Area police boss Cleti Kimaiyo said Kimune did not leave a suicide note. The body was taken to Kehancha District Hospital mortuary. “We want people to always find an amicable way of solving their problems, including getting counselling from church and elders,” Kimaiyo said.
