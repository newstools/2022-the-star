Comedian Eric Omondi has gone on hunger strike at Parliament to try and make it law that Kenyan TVs and radios should carry 75 percent local content. Local content can be very powerful. Citizen TV became the leading TV network in Kenya by being the first to create local soap operas. Now all the Kenyan TV stations have followed them. Vernacular radio stations play almost all music in local languages. In other words, there is no need to legislate to ensure that there is local content on TV and radio stations because it is already happening and winning market share. But if it is law that there has to be 75 percent local content, that will reduce the variety in the output of Kenyan TV and radio. It would no longer be possible to have a radio station specialising in reggae because most reggae groups are Caribbean or foreign. Do we want to go down that road? So let's not change the copyright law. Let TV and radios compete for audiences by offering both local and international content in varying permutations. Let's maintain variety in the Kenyan media.
