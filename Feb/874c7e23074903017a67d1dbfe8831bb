KCB Bank has been named Kenya's best investment bank and most valued banking brand in 2022 by Global Finance magazine and Brand Finance respectively. The awards recognised the efforts by KCB Bank to stimulate Kenya's economic growth following the global challenges arising from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The bank moved in to support MSMES when the pandemic hit in an effort to cushion and offer relief to customers. “In the past year, we have continued to put in effort into different sectors to help revamp the economy that was greatly affected by the pandemic. We have invested in our societies through different initiatives such as 2jiajiri and mifugo ni mali programme,” KCB Group CEO, Joshua Oigara said. He said the bank is continuously investing in mobile and internet banking as a move towards safer, easier and secure way of transacting. Global Finance magazine is a USA based firm that acknowledges and awards institutions in the finance sector for their efforts and contributions in different fields while Brand Finance is a brand valuation consultancy based in London. Oigara said KCB has been able to expand its brand value by capitalising on regional expansion into the East African market.
