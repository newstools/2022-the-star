Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wah was in for a rude shock in Kiambu after he was heckled for trying to attack Lari MP Jonah Mburu. The MP, who was part of deputy president William Ruto's entourage on Friday, was cut short while addressing the Kenya Kwanza Alliance rally. While addressing, Ichung'wah digressed to talk about MP Mburu in an apparent attempt to disparage him for supporting Azimio la Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Video footage of the incident shows the attempt was dead on arrival as a section of the crowd shut him down demanding he cease attacking their MP. The demand was so unequivocal that Ichung'wah was forced to halt his speech amidst chants and gestures instructing him not to go in that direction. "Your area MP here is called Jonah and he is my friend and...," Ichung'wah stated and the crowd immediately began chanting "He is the one we want, we want him again." Mburu is among the Mount Kenya MPs who have remained loyal to the Handshake team that brings together allies of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. While a majority of the MPs from Kiambu county have moved to the DP's camp, he has remained undeterred in rooting for the Azimio La Umoja movement. The DP and his allies including ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula pitched tents in Kiambu on Friday where they held a series of rallies. They drummed up support for their camp and urged residents not back the ODM leader for the top seat. The DP's Kiambu visit saw him tone down on attacks at Uhuru in what appeared to be a tactical move considering the area is Uhuru's home.
