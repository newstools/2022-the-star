Raphael Tuju has quit as Jubilee's secretary-general. The former Rarienda MP said he was grateful for the president's trust in him despite coming 'four kilometres from the home of your chief opponent." "Thank you for standing with me even at a personal level when I had a horrific accident until now I am able to stand here. Tuju did not reveal his next steps but said the president had given him other responsibilities. "We have agreed with the president that he will give me other responsibilities going forward,' Tuju said. He went on :. "I can't be secretary-general and also pursuing other political ambitions and doing other jobs he has given me.' The party is today expected to announce more far reaching changes to the party as it rebrands in readiness to join the Azimio La Umoja.
