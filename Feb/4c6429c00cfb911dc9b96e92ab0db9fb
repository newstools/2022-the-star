Deputy President William Ruto 's special secretary for Infrastructure and ICT Maurice Kakai Bisau has ditched the United Democratic Alliance party. Kaikai who was seeking the governor seat for Trans Nzoia county on a UDA ticket will now be going for the senate seat on an Azimio la Umoja ticket. His move, reports say, was inspired by the allegations that Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa stands a better chance to be backed by the DP owing to his alliance with Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. Wamalwa is eyeing the governor seat on a Ford Kenya ticket. Kaika's defection has now jolted the political landscape in the county and clearly turned the contest into a two-horse race between former Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya and Wamalwa. "As for now we are only having two viable candidates; Natembeya and  Wamalwa," Political analyst Kefa Were told the Star. Bisau who is expected to officially decamp to ODM this Sunday came second to outgoing governor Patrick Khaemba in the 2017 gubernatorial race. Natembeya and Bisau have now teamed up ahead of the August 9, polls with the latter promising to back the former for the governor seat. " Yes we are in talks with Honourable Bisau we will be making an announcement in due course. Trans Nzoia is ripe for greater things," Natembeya said. On the other hand, Bisau's spokesman Reverend Ferdinand Wafula said the journey to restore Trans Nzoia back on the path of economic revival has begun. "The coming together of this great gentlemen is a milestone towards the restoration of servant leadership. We will be making a big statement during the coming week," said Reverend Wafula. Some of Bisau's vote-hunt projects include building houses for widows and bursaries for the needy. Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya is expected to welcome Bisau to Azimio team on Sunday.
