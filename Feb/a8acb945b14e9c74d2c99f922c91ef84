There was an overpayment of Sh5.2 million to top members of management at the Bomet University College between October 2017 and June 2019, auditor general has said. Gathungu said the three former staff who were then acting in the capacities of principal and deputies earned basic salaries for the upper substantive positions contrary to the advisory of the State Corporations Advisory Committee. This, according to Gathungu, in her report tabled in Parliament for the year ending June 2019, was unlawful and led to loss of funds by the institution. And while the audit and compliance committee at the college resolved to recover the funds, the report said such was yet to be effected putting it on breach of the law. "At the time of audit in December 2019, the committee agreed to resolve the matter but there was no evidence to confirm the recoveries having been effected as directed," the report said. The former acting principal for example was paid in excess of Sh Sh1, 755,700 while the two deputies went home with Sh3,445,449 in total. The principal was to be paid Sh4,477,242 as substantive basic salary and Sh671,586 as acting allowance at the rate of 15 per cent bringing his total entitlement to Sh5,148,829, but ended up parting with Sh6,904,529. The two acting deputies on their part were to receive Sh9,363,215 as total entitlements as basic salary and allowances at the same rate but were paid Sh6, 404,332 each higher. The auditor general attributed the hitch to lack segregation of duties over its payroll, saying it was managed by a sole member of the staff whose duties included data capture, approval, change management and authorisation of payment. "Further, admin rights over the payroll system continue to be solely held by the vendor in exclusion of the management hence exposing the college to risks of unauthorised access," the report said.
