Anerlisa Muigai has told haters to learn to mind their own businesses. She has advised the stalkers to get more constructive work to do other than posting things about others over and over. "Do some people not get tired of posting basic sh.t over and over?" she wrote. "Like, start reading a book, educate yourself, find a job and be good at it, pick a language and perfect it, inspire people, be ambitious or find a hobby, not act childish from Monday to Monday. "Any person above 25 years should do any of the above. It hurts me to see people who have a lot of potential go to waste." Anerlisa's post came after she became a trending topic after she posted a video with a new man without revealing his face.
