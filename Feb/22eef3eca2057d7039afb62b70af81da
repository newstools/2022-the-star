Vihiga United coach Mike Mururi has expressed optimism that his side will make a comeback to the top flight Kenya Premier League. Coach Mururi said his charges are in high spirits after settling well in the second tier.  "The team endured a tough start at the beginning of the season but we have since settled," he noted. He said with the return of former star Amos Kigadi, the morale in the team is high and players are raring to go. "It's good to see Kigadi back in the team. Having played for us, he understands our philosophy and culture very well. With his presence, I believe the team will witness a great turnaround," he noted. "When the team was relegated to the National Super League, we lost many players to the top tier sides and this forced us to opt for high school players. We initially struggled quite a bit but I am happy the team picking up well," said Mururi. Kigadi, who has joined from Vihiga Bullets, expressed his excitement to be back at Vihiga United, terming the club as his second home. "I am very happy to be back home. This is the club that made me the player I am today and I am hoping to give my best as a way of reciprocating the faith they have shown in me," he said. He added: "I believe the technical bench and the playing unit have what it takes to help the team back to the top tier league," he added. Vihiga United are currently placed 11th with 12 points from 9 matches.
