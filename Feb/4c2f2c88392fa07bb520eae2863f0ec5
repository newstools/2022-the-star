Registrar of Political parties Ann Nderitu has told political outfits to set systems that will see internal disputes solved easily and quickly. Nderitu said there should be dialogue and negotiations within political parties to reduce cases of disputes within the parties. "We should be able to manage individuals within political parties to understand what the dispute is all about first before we let the dispute go beyond political parties and that calls for dialogue and knowledge sharing," Nderitu said. She spoke when she officially opened Training of Political Parties Internal Disputes Resolution Mechanism Committees at a Machakos hotel in Machakos County on Friday. "We came here in Machakos to train the internal dispute resolution mechanism committee members. The committees are required and anchored in the political parties constitution so that should there be a dispute, the first point of reference in terms of addressing dispute is the political parties itself," Nderitu said. 85 participants from all the 85 political parties attended. "So, with the amendment of the new law we wanted to enlighten political parties on the importance of establishing the internal dispute resolution committees and some of their members are undertaking training," Nderitu added. Nderitu said the parties were also educated on the provisions of the act according to the amendment act. The training was to guide parties on what to do in case of disputes together with PPDT because disputes that move from the internal dispute resolution Committees spill over to PPDT. She said PPDT had been given the mandate to address the disputes if not resolved at party levels.
