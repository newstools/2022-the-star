ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his ODM counterpart Raila Odinga are becoming sworn enemies. The two have lately engaged in a war of words aimed at decampaigning each other even as the August 9, elections nears. While launching his presidential bid, Musalia candidly said he will not work with Raila ahead of the forthcoming polls. The former vice president has labelled Raila and his Azimio La Umoja movement as a state project.
