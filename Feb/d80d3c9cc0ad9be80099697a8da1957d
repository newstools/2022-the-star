Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has warned Bungoma residents and Kenyans at large not to vote for deputy president William Ruto saying he won't be president. Speaking in Bungoma county during the DAP-K rally at Posta ground, CS Wamalwa said the August 9, presidential election will be won by ODM leader Raila Odinga. He dismissed chances of the DP winning the presidency even as he reiterated that the Azimio La Umoja movement, led by Raila, will form the next government. " I want to tell the people of Bungoma and Western at large that the next government will be formed by Raila Odinga," he said. He added: "Wewe ukiwa hapa umedanganywa an wenzetu wa wheelbarrow ati serikali itakua ya wheelbarrow aki ya mungu unadanganywa mchana, unaota ndoto ya mchana". Loosely translates to: "If you are here being cheated that the next government will be formed by the Wheelbarrow party I swear to God you are being misled and you are dreaming in broad daylight". The Defence CS exuded confidence that the August 9, elections is for Raila to lose. He said Raila will be sworn in as the fifth president and urged Bungoma residents not to waste their vote.
