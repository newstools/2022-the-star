ODM Party leader Raila Odinga’s Azimio brigade will take their campaigns to Laikipia county. The campaigns will be spearheaded by ODM deputy leader Hassan Joho and a team of MPS and governors. Raila is currently away in India but is expected to return to Kenya this weekend. On Saturday, during the Azimio campaigns, Joho told DP William Ruto to ‘man up’ and accord respect to President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila. Joho was speaking at Acunet stadium in Teso North subcounty during a charged rally that Azimio la Umoja leaders used to drum up support for Raila’s presidency. On the other hand, Ruto and allies will take the Hustler movement to Baringo county. The team is expected at AIC Kapropita, Baringo Central at 9am for a church service. By 11am, the team will be at Ilng'arua in Ilchamus, Baringo South before holding a rally at Kabarnet Showground, Baringo Central at around 2pm. During their campaigns on Saturday, Ruto brigade chided Uhuru over Raila endorsement. ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi claimed the President publicly proved that Raila Odinga and his Azimio la Umoja Movement are state projects. "For some time we have been asking whether the real owners of Azimio can come out. The president has now come out openly as the patron of the formation," Mudavadi said. "Uhuru does not want to leave power. He wants to install a puppet president so he can continue controlling government remotely."
