Civil society groups in Bungoma county have urged women to compete for elective politics if they have to have a say. They say the majority of women fear coming out and vying for elective seats because society will look down upon them. Led by Torch Africa director Prof Barasa Nyukuri, they called on front-runners in governor and presidential race to pick women as their deputies. "All male presidential candidates should nominate women as running mates, while governors should do the same where one gender is ahead of others," he added. He urged presidential candidates ODM leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto to pick women as their deputies, while governors like Anne Waiguru of Kirinyaga and Kitui's Charity Ngilu should pick men as deputies for gender parity to be realised. Nyukuri said women play a very important role in society and should compete with men in all elective seats. "We demand a Kenya's Khamala Harris. This will restore democracy and dignity for women," Nyukuri said. "Youth, women and people with disabilities should strive to fight for their space in politics because they can't just be nominated without showing any interest in politics." The lobby groups also called for peaceful elections. Edited by A.N
