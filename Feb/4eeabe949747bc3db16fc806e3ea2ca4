A Florida woman accused of stabbing her husband more than 140 times has been charged with murder. Joan Burke, 61, appeared before a Palm Beach County judge on Sunday via video conference and was charged with first-degree murder. Burke allegedly attacked her husband inside the kitchen of their home in Palm Springs, Florida on February 11. According to CNN, an incident report stated that Palm Springs police officers responded to Burke's home on the evening of February 11 after receiving a call from a man who identified himself as the son of the suspect. CNN reported that the caller said he had arrived home from work and discovered the body of his stepfather, Melvin Weller, 62, lying on the kitchen floor. Burke is said to have been in the house when her son called 911. When the police officers arrived at the scene, they found the deceased lying in a pool of blood, and next to the body were some cleaning tools. In an incident report, police noted that there was blood on the walls, cabinets and kitchen counters. They also found several knives and a meat cleaver in the kitchen sink. Burke was found lying in silence in the master bedroom. An autopsy revealed the victim suffered more than 140 stab wounds and a skull fracture caused by a blow to the head. Edited by M. Asamba
