Reigning women’s champions Equity Bank Hawks tackle Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) in a Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) playoff final Game One and Two at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium this weekend. The bankers, who will travel to Mombasa next weekend for Games Three, Four and Five — if necessary — must win in Nairobi for them to have a chance. Equity Bank head coach David Maina, talking before Saturday’s epic clash, said the matches in the city are must-win. “We have to win the games in Nairobi if we are to retain the championship. We are short in numbers but we will go all out especially this being the final round,” said Maina. He revealed that his post player, Maryanne Nyagaki, who missed two semi-final games through injury, has recovered and is available for selection. Maina said it is a big achievement to have two of the best teams in the country meeting in another playoff finals for the fifth year. KPA women’s coach Anthony Ojukwu said they are not taking any chances in their two matches in the capital. “We are already here and training hard for the two games. I have all my players available as we seek to take what is rightfully ours,” said Ojukwu, whose team arrived in Nairobi on Tuesday. He said the team has been having two training sessions every day ( morning and afternoon) and this gives them confidence for the task ahead. “We want to start off on a good footing here in Nairobi before moving to our back yard for the rest of the fixtures. We are well prepared,” he said. Hawks and KPA booked their finals tickets by beating Zetech University Sparks and Storms respectively in 3-0 scorelines.
