A petrol tanker burst into flames on Tuesday at Awendo town. The vehicle was parked at a nearby petrol station, where it was depositing fuel when the station caught fire at about 3 pm. A driver rushed to the tanker and drove it off to a safe place before jumping off. Awendo sub-county Police commander Mary Wakusu said no casualty was reported in the fire incident. "The fire engines from South Nyanza Sugar Company managed to contain the fire," Wakusu said. She said a petrol pump caught fire, and it spread to the tanker that was parked next to it. "It seems the heat spread to the tanker, which burst into flames despite being driven to a safe place,” Wakusu said. The officers rushed to the scene and prevented residents from coming closer to the tanker. The officer noted that firefighters from South Nyanza Sugar Company arrived in time to contain the fire, which had started to spread to adjacent buildings. “We are yet to establish the cause of the fire. We have launched investigations. We talked to the public and urged them to stay away from the scene," she said. The officer noted that other pumps containing fuel had been emptied. "There was no petrol in other pumps,” she said.
