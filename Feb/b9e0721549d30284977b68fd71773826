Constitutional lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi has dismissed statements by Deputy President William Ruto that the UDA party now has a chance of winning with 70 per cent of votes cast. The senior counsel told off the UDA team accusing them of exaggerating their popularity even as he admitted the tendency of exuding extreme confidence in a party's strength is common among political outfits. He, however, gave the Kenya Kwanza Alliance a commanding lead of over 60 per cent "Parties like to exaggerate their popularity. It is total propaganda to state that UDA is at 70 per cent. That is false. The more accurate figure according to a number of polls is btw 62 to 64 per cent...let us just be honest people!" he said. Ahmednasir was responding to a video where the DP said the UDA party has formed a partnership with like-minded outfits to ensure they win by over 70 per cent of the votes cast in the August 9, elections. "We have organised ourselves into a strong team to get 70 per cent of the votes cast in the August 9, elections. "That is to ensure that we win round one by 70 per cent so that Raila Odinga loses with a wide margin, so much so, that he cannot protest over the polls or swear himself in. We want him to pack and go home without any doubt that he lost," the DP said while in a campaign trail in Limuru. According to the latest opinion polls, however, the DP has been put ahead of Raila even as it appears that the ODM leader is close in on the gap. The latest opinion poll from the Radio Africa Group showed Ruto maintaining his lead in the presidential race. According to the poll, 46.1 per cent of registered voters say they will vote for Ruto in the presidential election on August 9 while 35.1 per cent say they will vote for Raila. Ruto's lead will not be sufficient for him to win on the first round with a simple majority (50 per cent plus one vote).
