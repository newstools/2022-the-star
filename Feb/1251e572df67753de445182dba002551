Rising javelin star Meshack Kipkogei has received a new javelin ahead of Athletics Kenya (AK) first track meeting set for this weekend at the Nyayo Stadium. Kipkogei, who missed the World Under-20 Championships after getting involved in a road accident, said the new javelin will motivate him to develop his career as a thrower. “This is good for my career development and it comes as a surprise to me.  The school played a critical role in securing the equipment for me,” said Kipkogei. The Form 4 student at ACK St. Thomas Secondary School, Kapchumba, received the javelin from his school principal David Barno, who is also his coach. “ I am happy to have the javelin and I hope to reciprocate this nice gesture by posting good results. Despite missing the World Under-20 Championships last year, I have recovered and I am looking forward to better tidings,” said Kipkogei. Principal Barno said the school has always been supporting academics and co-curriculum activities and the 19- year-old athlete happens to be one of the beneficiaries. “Kipkogei is so hard-working and that is why I saw the need to support him. He is good in both academics and co-curriculum activities. In class, he is above average and talented,” said Barno. Apart from javelin, he said Kipkogei is also a good volleyball player because of his height.  “I teach him agriculture and from the look of things, his future is bright,” said Barno after handing over the javelin to him.
