Ford Kenya deputy party leader and Bobasi MP Innocent Obiri has joined Wiper party led Kalonzo Musyoka. The MP defected to Wiper on Thursday when the Wiper leader was on a campaign trail in the Kisii region. Obiri said he moved to Wiper because his heart was still at Oka and was therefore not ready to be a party to Kenya Kwanza. "I was in Oka, I did not want to leave there but because they moved out of Oka and my heart was still there today I have joined Wiper," Obiri said. The MP pledged to popularise the Wiper party in Kisii saying it will reap big in the August 9, elections. Klaonzo welcomed Obiri who led a team of MCAs in joining his party. He said the MP resolved to quit Ford Kenya after Wetaungula moved to deputy president William Ruto's camp without consulting members. "Obiri is a man who is highly respected in Kenya. It was because of what you saw in the newspaper that he chose to move in the opposite direction because of his love for the Kisii people. I am happy to welcome him wholeheartedly to the Wiper party," he said. Kalonzo promised to give the MP a befitting welcome at the Wiper party headquarter in the near future. Obiri was elected on Kenya National Congress ticket before joining Ford Kenya. He joined the party and was immediately promoted to the leadership rank. The Bobasi replaced Kitutu Chache MP Richard Onyonka who was Ford Kenya deputy party leader before joining the ODM party. The move serves as a blow to Wetang'ula who has suffered a massive members' haemorrhage after many of his allies moved to rivals. This is after he declared that he will work with Ruto.
