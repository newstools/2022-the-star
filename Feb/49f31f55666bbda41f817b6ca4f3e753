President Uhuru Kenyatta has put a strong case for outgoing Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju's political ambitions. The president who spoke during the Jubilee National Delegates Convention at KICC asked ODM leaders not to mistreat Tuju. 'This man Tuju loves his country, please I hand him over to you ODM on whatever he is looking for, he is our Jubilee man and doesn't frustrate him," Uhuru said. At the same time, Uhuru asked Mombasa governor Hassan Joho who is the ODM deputy party leader to hold Tuju's hand. Tuju quit as Jubilee secretary-general on Saturday to pursue political ambitions amid reports he is eyeing a seat in Siaya county. But Uhuru asked Tuju to accept being a member of the Jubilee National Executive Committee. "Please, accept to be part of our NEC," Uhuru asked Tuju. The former Rarienda MP had earlier resigned from the SG position. Tuju said he was grateful for the president's trust in him despite coming 'four kilometres from the home of your chief opponent. "Thank you for standing with me even at a personal level when I had a horrific accident until now I am able to stand here," he stated. Tuju did not reveal his next steps but said the president had given him other responsibilities in the coming days. Ndaragwa MP JeremiahKioni was appointed Tuju's replacement.
