Media personality Betty Kyallo says communication has made co-parenting with baby daddy Dennis Okari easy. Speaking to Plug TV, the mother of one described it as a wonderful thing. "You know things happen in this world like people separating or divorcing. It is life," Kyallo said. "But I think if you are able to find a cordial way to interact with your ex-partner, especially for the benefit of the child, I think that is extremely important and crucial." She said Okari and her are good friends so as to make sure their daughter has the best. "We co-parent and we talk. The thing is communication," she said. "We aren't enemies. We make sure to give Ivanna the best life because she deserves it. She is innocent. I think this advice goes for everybody else who has separated from their partner after having a child with them. It is important the child's interests are put first."
