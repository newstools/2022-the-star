Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola brushed off suggestions that his team are the best in the world, even as the reigning English champions stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to 12 points after Wednesday's 2-0 win over Brentford. Riyad Mahrez and Kevin De Bruyne scored a goal each as City extended their unbeaten run to 14 league games, pulling further clear of second-placed Liverpool, who have two games in hand. "We are not the best team in the world. The best team is Chelsea, who won the (European) Champions League, or River Plate, who won in South America," Guardiola told reporters. "I don't know. "The important thing is we won the game and in three days we go to Norwich (City) and have to win again. "This type of thing about who is the best, I don't care. Just be happy and try to play better every day. And at the end, we will see." Guardiola has led City to three league titles since taking over in 2016, though they are yet to win the Champions League, coming closest after reaching the final last season. "We are in a good position, 60 points at the moment," Guardiola added. "We have to qualify for the Champions League (next season) because that is the most important target and then arrive in the last few games fighting for the title. This is what I want to do."
