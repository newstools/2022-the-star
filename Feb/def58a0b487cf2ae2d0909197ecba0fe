Kakamega Homeboyz FC players have been asked to maintain the tempo as they seek to win their first Kenyan Premier League title this year. Homeboyz team manager, Boniface Imbenzi, said the next five matches will be very vital for them and the league title solely depends on their performance. "We have several tough matches lined up against us and we will have to be at our best. Our success will majorly depend on how we will approach them," he noted. "If we collect maximum points, we will no doubt be in pole position to win the league. However, we can’t underestimate our opponents at any cost," he quipped. "He said they will capitalise on the current break to put their house in order and rectify a few areas. Imbeinzi also lauded the club's medical team for the excellent job that has seen the majority of the players remain fit as well as limiting the number of injuries. Meanwhile, Kakamega Homeboyz captain and veteran winger, Moses Mudavadi, has promised to rally his teammates towards their dream of sealing the league title. "We know at the moment the league is tight and very competitive but we want to give our best so that we can seize the title and live our dream,” Mudavadi stated. Kakamega Homeboyz, who are at the summit of the table with 37 points from 18 matches, are expected to play Posta Rangers, AFC leopards, KCB, and Bandari among others.
