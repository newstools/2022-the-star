Churchill comedian Akuku Danger has been discharged from the hospital a week after he got readmitted. Akuku had earlier been discharged after weeks of hospitalisation only for him to develop an infection days later. This forced him to be readmitted. Sandra Dacha said she is happy to have her bae at home, adding that they still need financial support to offset the hospital bill. "Akuku Danger gets to go home once again, having been readmitted a week ago after being diagnosed with a new heart infection, pneumonia, and pulmonary tuberculosis," she wrote on social media. "We are happy that once again, Akuku gets to be discharged, from the Nairobi West Hospital. He can now go home and will be on bed rest as he is still on medication." The comedian's fans and friends are still fundraising for his medical bill through Paybill: 891300 Account No. Akuku.
