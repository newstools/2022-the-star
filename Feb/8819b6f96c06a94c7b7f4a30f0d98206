ODM Nyanza region delegates conference that had been scheduled for Tuesday next week in Kisii has been postponed. Governors James Ongwae (Kisii) and Anyang' Nyong'o (Kisumu) said the meeting has been pushed because of tough logistics. They said that it would be a nightmare for the same delegates to attend the regional meeting and travel to Nairobi two days later for the national delegates conference. The party has scheduled its National Delegates Conference on Friday and Saturday next week in Nairobi. "We are telling our delegates that the Kisii meeting has been postponed and that they will be informed accordingly," Ongwae said. ODM's next week NDC is expected to endorse the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. Jubilee party will also be holding its NDC at the same time before having a joint session with ODM that will see Raila endorsed by Jubilee also.
