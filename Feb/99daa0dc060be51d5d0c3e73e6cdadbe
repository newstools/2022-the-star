Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga, the host governor, will not be attending the Sagana State Lodge meeting. This is the first time the Sagana meeting, which is the third, will take place in his absence. In previous meetings, the governor would be the one to receive the Head of State when he arrived at Sagana. A source from the governor's office said the governor will not be attending the meeting after he ditched Jubilee Party. "That is a Jubilee meeting. The governor is in UDA, and so he will not be attending the meeting," they said. Thousands of Jubilee supporters from various areas within the Mt Kenya region have arrived at Sagana State Lodge. The president is yet to arrive at the venue. Earlier, there was chaos outside the State Lodge after the police tried to block some supporters who did not have invitation cards from accessing the venue. Police had a hard time trying to mobilize the hundreds of supporters who were not on the list of attendants. They even vandalised a section of the fence and gate as they tried to access the venue. They were eventually allowed in. Residents started arriving at the State Lodge at around 2am while MPs and dignitaries allied to the Jubilee Party and Azimio La Umoja started streaming in at around 9 am. Among MPs present include local MPs Kanini Kega (Kieni), Ngunjiri Wambugu (Nyeri Town) and Gichuki Mugambi (Othaya). Others are former Gatanga MP Peter Keneth, nominated MP Maina Kamanda, Jude Njomo (Kiambu town), Jeremiah Kioni (Ndaragwa), former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga former, Embu senator Lenny Kivuti, among others.
