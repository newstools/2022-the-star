Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama has claimed that One Kenya Alliance (Oka) leaders are just playing poker games before joining Azimio la Umoja side. Azimio La Umoja movement is led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. In a tweet on Wednesday, Muthama said: “We know the end result of this poker game. One Kenya Alliance is Azimio and Azimio is One Kenya Alliance. Let's stop the charade tuambiane ukweli,” he said. Muthama added that no amount of potency and coercion will make Azimio take the presidency. “They may have " deep state" backing but it will be futile at the end. The reading is on the wall 9.8.22 by the God's grace UDA will form the next government.” His claims came following the announcement by OKA affiliate parties that they will deposit its coalition agreement at the Registrar of parties on February 28. They are; Kanu led by Gideon Moi, Kalonzo Mysyoka's Wiper, Cyrus Jirongo's UDP and Martha Karua's Narc Kenya. This will pave the way for the official unveiling of the coalition that brings together four parties. The leaders addressed a press conference at Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka Command Center in Karen, Nairobi, after signing a deed of assignment to officially allow the four parties to own the Alliance. During the address, Kanu's leader said that the Alliance's technical team has concluded working on the coalition agreement. The agreement comes after ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi ditched the alliance and agreed to work together with UDA, and a similar move was made by Ford-Kenya. After joining Deputy President William Ruto's side, Musalia revealed that some of the Oka principles were secretly in talk with Azimio. Mudavadi added that his move came after realising that dishonesty dominated the Oka team. Oka added that they will work with the other parties who share the same agenda ahead of the August 9 election. Last week, the former Prime Minister said that Azimio will be registered soo as it looks forward to forming a coalition with other parties.
