South Rift top guns on Wednesday backed ODM leader Raila Odinga's bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 9 General Election. The delegation led by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos described the opposition chief as the best bet for the South Rift region. The powerful delegation also had former head of Public Service Sally Kosgey, ex MP Paul Sang, CAS Stephen Tarus and Kipkorir Menjo. The leaders made the declaration during a meeting with the Azimio leader at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Foundation in Upperhill, Nairobi. Kosgey described Raila as a consistent leader who can be trusted with the leadership of the country. "I can vouch for someone who is as good as his word. I have known Raila since 1980s and he is one man who means his word," Kosgey said. Kosgey, a powerful figure in the late Daniel Moi's government, also defended Raila's push for constitutional amendment saying the 2010 constitution had some pending issues that need to be addressed. Tolgos said his team will deliver at least 40 per cent of the South Rift vote to the Azimio candidate. "My job is to coordinate the leaders from the region and I am so certain we will push Raila's vote to at least 40 percent," Tolgos said.
