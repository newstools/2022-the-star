Deputy President William Ruto has sustained an onslaught against the ODM leader Raila Odinga. Speaking at Ngano, Oljoorok, Nyandarua county, Ruto said he knows Raila well and will beat him hands down in the forthcoming polls. He told the ODM boss to prepare to board a wheelbarrow to Bondo come August 9 polls since he is poised for a humiliating defeat. It is in the same rally that he dismissed those fashioning the August polls as a race between him and President Uhuru Kenyatta saying Raila is his main competitor. "The battle is between us and Mr Kitendawili (Raila), not President Uhuru Kenyatta. Is that Kitendwili not the same person we defeated? Don't we know him? Let him prepare very well because we are going to defeat him very early in the morning and put him on a wheelbarrow to Bondo," he said. The ODM leader's rural home is in Bondo, Siaya county. Ruto further labelled Raila as a non-performer saying he never delivered to Kenyans when he was given an opportunity to serve at higher office. "I have been the deputy president of the Republic of Kenya, Raila was the Prime Minister some times back, did he do anything tangible for you to point at and say this is Raila's effort? But we have built colleges, roads and connected homes to electricity," he said. Ruto faulted the Handshake deal for the Jubilee failures in its second term saying many development projects stalled because of his entry. He exuded confidence that he will revive the dwindling economy and continue from where the President left. "The big four agenda is our priority as we seek government. As I have said before, by December this year, everyone will have an NHIF card to sort his health costs. Our plan is to revive the economy and better the lives of ordinary citizens," he said. Ruto is set to visit Nyeri county on Saturday to ostensibly counter Uhuru's endorsement of the ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid.
