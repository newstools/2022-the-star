World football governing body, Fifa, has suspended Kenya from all international competitions. Fifa honcho Gianni Infantino said Zimbabwe had also suffered a similar fate and lashed out at the governments of the two countries for poking their noses into football activities, contrary to Fifa statutes. “We had to suspend two of our member associations — Kenya and Zimbabwe. Both for government interference in the activities of the football associations of these associations,” said Infantino on Thursday evening. “These associations are suspended from footballing activities with immediate effect and they know what needs to be done for them to be re-admitted or for the suspension to be lifted.” The move comes barely a week after the women's national team Harambee Starlets were disqualified from the Africa Women Cup of Nations qualifiers against Uganda that had been slated for February 17. Barry Otieno — who served as CEO at the disbanded federation— wrote a letter to the continental football governing body, Caf, seeking the withdrawal of Starlets from the continental showpiece. Trouble began on November 11, when Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed disbanded the Nick Mwendwa-led administration and appointed a caretaker committee to preside over the activities of football in the country. Retired Justice Aaron Ringera assumed the mantle to head a 15-member committee that would serve for six months. Others appointed to sit on the committee were General Retired Moses Oyugi, Fatma Adan, Philip Musyimi, Anthony Isayi, Elisha Kiplagat and Hassan Haji, Fredrick Tureisa, Mwangi Muthee, Neddy Atieno, Ali Amour, Titus Kasuve, Richard Omwela, Bobby Ogolla and JJ Masiga. The CS swung into action after receiving the audit report on FKF from Sports Registrar Rose Wasike. Hours earlier, she had snubbed a Senate summon to appear before the Social and Welfare Committee chaired by Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja.
