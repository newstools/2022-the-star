Homa Bay fishermen must stop bad fishing practices to address fish shortage of in Lake Victoria, agriculture executive Aguko Juma has said. Juma argued some dishonest fishermen have continually engaged in outlawed practices that interfere with growth of fish in the lake. The county government official spoke after a section of fishermen raised concerns of losing their jobs due increased fish importation. The fishing community led by traders Alice Odhiambo and Rose Langa claimed that imported fish are taking over the market in Homa Bay. Odhiambo who sells tilapia said the imported fish are sold at lower prices which is a threat to their business. “Some people introduced foreign fish in our markets. They sell them at throw away prices yet they are not sweet,” she said. Speaking to journalists at Pier market in Homa Bay town, Langa, who is the chairperson of the traders, said sometimes they have to sell their fish at a loss to prevent them from going bad. “They transport tons of fish using lorries to Homa Bay. In a day, at least six lorries enter our market,” Langa said. Juma assured the business people that they are working closely with Kenya Maritime Authority, Kenya Coast Guards and Kenya Fisheries Services to arrest dishonest fishermen who conduct bad fishing practices. “Lake Victoria is the main source of livelihood for many people in Homa Bay. We’ll not allow bad fishing practices to destroy the sector,” Juma said.
