Gospel artist Man Ingwe has made a music comeback after a long break. Speaking to Word Is, Man Ingwe said he will now be called Mr Leopard as most of his global audience had trouble pronouncing his name. "I am an author, a motivational speaker and the moment someone types my name three times and they can't find it then you need to provide a solution," he said. "Ingwe is a leopard, so now I am going by Mr Leopard." He rose to fame for the hit song 'Ugali Sosa' which he released 11 years ago. "I am talented and each talent requires the right foundation. So I retreat to create the foundation I needed." "Now I am ready to come back not only with music but with so much more." Ingwe said he is coming back to rule the industry. "Two months from now I am going to release a song." He is putting up a resource centre to help kids within his neighbourhood access the library. "If you want to change the society you begin from the base.'I also have a development centre, one is for different fields like teaching, dancing etc. I am also trying to put a recording theatre where people can record live music back in the village."
