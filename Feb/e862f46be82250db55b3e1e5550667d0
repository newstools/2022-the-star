The Star has just published the results of the February Radio Africa opinion poll. William Ruto is still in the lead with 47 percent support while Raila Odinga is on a plateau at 35 percent, the same as in January after climbing steadily from 14 percent in July. It is still a long way until August 9 and a lot can happen between now and then. Polls only give a snapshot of a moment in time. Politicians praise opinion polls when they show them leading and dismiss them as fabricated when they show them losing. But properly conducted opinion polls are very accurate. Yesterday, the Daily Nation newspaper reported that Azimio la Umoja will use private opinion polling to determine which candidates should contest for particular seats. And the polling will not just be to choose between potential candidates from the Azimio constituent parties. A spokesperson went so far as to say that, if they found a UDA candidate was the most popular, they would make every effort to get that person to cross over to Azimio. So politicians do believe in opinion polls. They just don't want to admit it. Quote of the day: "You can jail a Revolutionary, but you can't jail the Revolution." Huey P.
