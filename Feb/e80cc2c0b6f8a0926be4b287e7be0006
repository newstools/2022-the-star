Safaricom’s mobile money service, M-PESA yesterday announced an Sh20 million sponsorship for the second edition of the Magical Kenya Ladies Golf Open. The tournament, organised by U.COM Event, is part of the Ladies European Tour and will run from February 10-13 at the Vipingo Ridge, Baobab Course in Kilifi County— the only (UK) PGA accredited golf course in Africa. The collaboration is a follow-up from the first edition in 2019, where the telco was one of the key sponsors of the event which brings together Kenya amateurs and pro golfers. “We are honoured to be part of the Ladies European Tour— the first event of the 2022 season—which makes a return to the country and East Africa for the second time. "The event provides Kenyan lady golfers with an opportunity to learn and grow in the sport and we look forward to seeing the players in action,” said Peter Ndegwa, CEO, Safaricom. Since its formation in 1978, the event has crowned more than 250 winners, with 700 championship trophies won by players from over 30 countries. The tournament will be a 72-stroke play golf competition and over 100 players are set to take to the course over the four days, with the field cut to 60 for the final two days of play. “We are excited to welcome back Safaricom through its M-PESA brand as one of the main sponsors of this highly anticipated event. Preparations for the event are in top gear and we are ready to host the tournament which is the only women’s professional golf competition in the East African region,” said Dirk Glittenberg, CEO, U.COM Event Among those scheduled to participate in the tournament is German lady professional Esther Henseleit who is back to defend her Magical Kenya Ladies Open title and South African star Lee-Ann Pace. Meanwhile, the Kenya team will comprise four amateurs and one professional.  Naomi Wafula and Mercy Nyamchama will lead the charge for the amateurs alongside 14-year-old Chanelle Wangari of Vet Lab and Faith Chemtai of Nandi Bears.
