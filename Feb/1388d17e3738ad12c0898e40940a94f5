Seven aspirants have shown interest in the race to unseat Vihiga Woman Rep Beatrice Adagala. They are Ruth Bukachi, Rhoda Mbandu,  Afandi Lukalo, Mary Amalemba, Jackline Mwenesi, Winnie Majani and Violet Bagada. Bagada and Mwenesi were nominated to the Vihiga county assembly after the 2017 general election. Mwenesi was nominated under the Progressive Party of Kenya led by former Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga, while Bagada was nominated under Musalia’s Amani National Congress. “I will contest for the position through the ODM party,” Majani said. Bukachi who was in UDA, walked out of the party to contest as an independent candidate. “UDA was a good party but it has been hijacked by political cartels who think they are better than others,” Bukachi said. Bagada, Amalemba, Lukalo, and Mbandu are yet to declare which party they will contest on. Amalemba and Mbandu will be banking on their political experience to unseat Adagala after losing to her in 2017. Adagala said she will defend her seat through the ANC party and is positive she will win. “My people can justify what I have done, my record will prove it,” she said. Adagala was elected as the Vihiga woman rep in 2017 after the incumbent Dorcus Kedogo moved to contest for Vihiga parliamentary seat under the ODM party. In 2013 Adagala contested for the position but she lost to Kedogo. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
