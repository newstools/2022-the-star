President Uhuru Kenyatta has slammed politicians for continuously faulting his administration over performance. The Head of State said Kenya has made strides in the deliverance of key government promises, including quality health care services to its citizens. "Kazi tunafanya. Kazi haifanywi juu ya magari, inafanywa ofisini," said Uhuru during the official opening of the Health Workforce Conference at Sarova Whitesands Mombasa. Loosely translated, "We are working. Work is not done in political rallies. It is done in offices." The president has in the past accused his deputy William Ruto of dwelling on campaigns instead of focusing on the Jubilee agenda. On healthcare, he said Kenya is currently receiving referrals from other countries in the region. "The Kenya University Teaching and Referral Molecular Centre has so far treated over 200 patients since its commissioning," he said. "In Kenya, we have been able to put up healthcare systems for our people. We have made strides, even though we have not yet fully achieved what we want, but we are moving in the right direction," said Uhuru. The President, who is later in the afternoon expected to roll out the Universal Health Coverage programme at Port Reitz Sub County Hospital in Mombasa, said Kenya has qualified health professionals. "The reason why United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are coming for our nurses, it is because they are qualified. We are producing a quality workforce, " he said. However, Uhuru added that there is a need to ensure the skills of the local doctors match with the technology used in other countries.
