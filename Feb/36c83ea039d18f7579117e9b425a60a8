ODM is set to hold a Nyanza region delegates conference on Tuesday next week. Kisii Governor James Ongwae said the region must hold a delegates conference ahead of the national delegates scheduled for end of next week in Nairobi. Ongwae said the conference will only be for invited delegates because not all can attend. “We have over 10,000 delegates from the region, and we cannot invite them all for the meeting hence those who will be invited from their various branches are the ones who will attend the regional meeting,” he said. “It should be clear that the decision has been made in Kisumu and not in any other county out of a meeting of the leadership that was appointed to discuss this matters.” The county chief said during the conference, they will have discussions on their preferred presidential candidate and how to mobilise people within the region to vote for their candidate. “We will also be discussing the transparency with which we should be undertaking our operations as ODM with complete democracy among other matters set for the meeting.” Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili however said the county will be holding their delegates conference on Monday in preparation for the Tuesday event. Kisumu county assembly speaker Elisha Oraro said the delegates' conference that will happen in Kisii is a precursor of what will happen in Nairobi. Oraro said the region is presenting the fifth president and therefore they must show the world that we are in support of his journey. He said, “Its going to be for invited delegates only because of Covid-19 protocols that must be adhered to and regret that we will not invite all the delegates.” “We count on your support and we still urge everyone who is believing in the journey of Raila Odinga that voting matters and must ensure that they have votes card for voting come August.”  (edited by Amol Awuor)
