Murang'a Woman rep Sabina Chege on Tuesday appeared before IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati over rigging claims. She is accompanied by lawyer James Orengo, senator Ledama OleKina and MP Otiende Amollo who is also a lawyer. The IEBC's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee  summoned Chege over her recent utterances regarding the 2017 presidential outcome. The utterances were made at a public rally in Isibuye in Vihiga County on  February 10, 2022, during the Azimio la Umoja Movement mobilisation rally. In a statement on Friday, the commission's Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee secretary asked the MP to appear before the commission's electoral code of conduct enforcement committee on Tuesday for interrogation. While urging residents to register in large numbers as voters so that they can vote in ODM leader Raila Odinga to be the fifth President, Chege ended up saying:  "Kule central nimeskia hapawengine wakisema hapa tuliwaibia, kuna kaukweli kidogo. Lakini mjue kama tulijua kuiba si ata hii tutafanya nini...alafu…alafu".
