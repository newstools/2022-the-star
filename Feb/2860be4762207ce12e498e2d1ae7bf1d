City residents can breathe a sigh of relief after Nairobi County Assembly slashed the proposed levies in the Finance Bill, 2021. This follows an outcry during a public participation meeting held last month by the County Assembly Budget Committee on the proposed charges. Motorists parking their cars in Nairobi Central Business District (Zone I) will still pay Sh200 after MCAs rejected the proposed Sh400. The same parking fees will be applied for Zone II covering Westlands, Yaya Centre, Upper Hill, Community, Ngara, Highridge, Industrial area, Gigiri, Kilimani, Milimani, Hurlingham, Lavington, Karen and Eastleigh. The aforementioned areas were proposed to pay Sh300 parking fees. Parking in Zone III will attract a fee of Sh100  while those in Zone IV, which is areas bordering other counties, will part with Sh50 . Charges for unloading trucks have been cut by  more than a half. Offloading an avocado pickup will now cost Sh500 and not Sh1,500, while unloading a Toyota Probox carrying the same commodity will cost Sh400 and not Sh800. Offloading a tonne of French beans and macadamia will be charged  Sh400 from Sh1,000. Thorn melon will be pay Sh20 per box and not Sh50 while a lorry of flowers will now cost Sh1,000 from the proposed Sh3,000. For tomatoes, a large box will be charged at Sh80 not Sh200; a medium box Sh50 from Sh100 while a small box will cost Sh20 not Sh50. Offloading a 50kg bag of potatoes will now cost Sh20 from the original Sh50. It will now be free to operate eateries and nyama choma joints at the newly built Westlands Market after the committee scrapped off a proposed fee of Sh36 and Sh70 per square foot. The nil charges will also apply to butcheries, salons, curios and stalls at the market, with the proposed charges of between Sh26 and Sh100 scrapped. This also applies to Karindini Market where the proposed charges of between Sh30 and Sh60 to operate market stalls and food courts have been removed. Fees for landing animals carcasses have also been revised downwards with a pig being charged Sh70 from Sh150, a goat Sh30 from Sh70 and a cow sh150 from Sh300. For fish, a large basket will be charged Sh150 and not the original Sh400; a medium basket Sh100 and not Sh300; and a small basket Sh70 and not Sh200. “In addition, the committee has proposed that the Cess fees for all categories of farm produce and landing fees for animals or cold dressed carcass be reduced by about 50 per cent,” said the committee chairperson Robert Mbatia. The suggested food handling fees for cereal, milk, kiosks, mobile cookers and soft drink shops will coast Sh1000 from the proposed Sh7,000 to Sh10,000. Certificates for soft drinks or snack shops will now be charged Sh1,000, and not Sh5,000, Sh10,000 and Sh7,000 respectively. Mobile cookers and barbecues will cost Sh2,000, down from Sh7,000 as earlier proposed. The cost of certificates for mobile food caterers with motor vehicles will be reduced from Sh7,000 to Sh3,500 while that for running a food kiosk will be Sh1,000 and not Sh7,000. Across all Nairobi county heath facilities, Covid-19 PCR testing will now cost Sh1,500, down from the proposed Sh3,000. At the Pumwani College of Nursing and Midwifery, it will cost Sh 40,000 for a certificate in registered midwifery for one year course down from Sh80,000. A diploma will be charge Sh100,000 for a three year course and Sh50,000 and not Sh90,000 for a one year course. Mobile food vendors and hawkers will not be charged for the food hygiene licenses after MCAs removed the propose fee of Sh7,000 while the vendors with vehicles will be charged Sh3,500. Vending at Uhuru Park will attract an yearly charge of Sh3,000 down from Sh5,000. Hawkers without vehicles have also received a reprieve as they will not be charged the proposed Sh7,000 annual fee. However, those with vehicles and in a designated area selling agricultural products will now pay Sh 5,000 per year and not the proposed Sh15,000. Small informal-sector traders and service providers will be charged Sh2000 and not the proposed Sh3,500. This includes street vendors dealing with newspapers, shoe repairers and shoe shiners.’ The amended levies will take effect after Governor Ann Kananu assents to the bill or after 14 days of publication of the bill in the Kenya Gazette.
