Former East African community Chief Administrative Secretary Ken Obura has been unveiled to contest against the incumbent Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong'o in the August 9 polls. This is after Senator Fred Outa, ex-Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo and former governor Jack Ranguma resolved to back Obura for the seat. The four, who have been aspiring to oust Nyong'o, said they have shelved their ambition and decided to support Obura for the sake of Kisumu County residents. They said Obura will battle out with Nyong'o for the ODM party ticket and expressed confidence that they will clinch the ticket in the April nominations. In addition, the team said they have an alternative plan under the Azimio la Umoja should party primaries be shambolic. They said they had another candidate who will also face Nyong'o on an independent ticket if nominations are not done in a free, fair and transparent manner. Obura, in his acceptance speech during a rally at Kisumu City's CBD on Friday, pledged to mount structured campaigns to defeat Nyong'o. "By next week, I will officially start campaigns to sell our policies. We will conduct a door-to-door campaign to woo voters," he said. The former Kisumu Central MP assured residents that he would initiate projects that will improve their livelihoods if they elected him as the next governor. Obura blamed the administration of Nyong'o for destroying the livelihoods of small scale traders following the demolition of their structures in the city. He supported the development projects but said they should be done in a humane manner by offering alternative space for traders to do business. "In my government, I will ensure the interest of traders, bodaboda operators and all residents are fully factored and protected," Obura said. The team have seen traversing the seven sub-counties namely Nyando, Seme, Kisumu Central, Muhoroni, Kisumu East, Nyakach and Kisumu West in Kisumu to popularise their bid.
