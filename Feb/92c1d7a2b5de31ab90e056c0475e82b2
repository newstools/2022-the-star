Four people were Wednesday killed when a vehicle they were using ran over a bomb that had been set on the road in Andaki, Wajir County. The four were travelling in a land cruiser and are believed to have been carrying foodstuffs when the vehicle ran over an Improvised Explosive Device (IED). Police said the incident happened at about 11 am at Erga along Wajir-Gerile Road, Wajir South and not far from the porous Kenya-Somalia border. Outgoing North Eastern regional police boss Rono Bunei said response teams were on the ground pursuing those behind the latest incident. “All the four occupants died. Our teams are on the ground pursuing those behind it, but we call for support from locals,” he said. Police suspect the explosion was set up by al-Shabaab militants operating in the area. The incident comes three days after at least 10 passengers were killed and many others injured in a similar incident along the Arabia-Mandera Highway. The matatu was ferrying an unknown number of passengers to Mandera Town on Monday when it ran over an IED. The terrorists have been attacking areas in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa counties after breaching security zones. This has left dozens of civilians and security officials dead and wounded. The terrorists have been planting explosives on the routes used by the security agencies. They have also been targeting communication masts in their attacks. There are concerns the persistent attacks are grounding operations in the region. Transport has been grounded as there are few movements in fear of attacks. Police have been mounting operations in the areas to deter further attacks. This has affected, among others, the education sector forcing tens of teachers who are non-locals to flee. The border region has borne the brunt of repeated attacks from the militants, who are at times aided by locals. The area is near the Somalia border, and the militants usually cross at will and stage attacks before escaping back.
