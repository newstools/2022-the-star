President Uhuru Kenyatta has defended ODM leader Raila Odinga over claims of being a state project as he declared support for the Azimio La Umoja Movement. President took a swipe at his deputy William Ruto over the state project tag saying the DP has panicked ahead of the August 9 contest. He denied utterances that Raila is getting backing of the State in the August elections. DP Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza have been branding Raila a state project who will defend the interests of a few billionaires if elected. Uhuru declared before a meeting of the ODM National Delegates Convention (NDC) that they, alongside the former Prime Minister, will hold joint countrywide rallies in the next two weeks to popularise Azimio. The rallies will culminate in the unveiling of the Azimio candidate to face Ruto. "If you have failed in organising yourself and has panicked, the easiest thing is to call your competitor a project," Uhuru said. He added: "We shall crisscross the country together and after two weeks we will retreat here and unveil our joint candidate as Azimio La Umoja. "At the same time, Uhuru termed Raila a peacemaker dismissing critics who have always branded him as a violent."A man who looks at the cause of violence is a peacemaker. Raila is a peacemaker." He also disclosed that OKA chiefs have committed to unity talks geared to rallying behind a candidate who will form the next government. The head of state described the former political archrival as the only candidate who can ensure an all-inclusive government. Uhuru was speaking during ODM NGC at Kasarani gymnasium. "Raila the politician is the man I have been in competition with for many years, I am here because of Raila leader. There is a difference between a politician and a leader."
