Doctors Without Borders has paused its work in Ukraine. The medical charity, also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), is often among the last to remain in war zones, but says it has been forced to halt its operations due to the escalating conflict. This comes after Amnesty International earlier said the invasion of Ukraine had been "marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals".
