Nairobi Prisons women's volleyball team have pulled out of the third leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league set for Mombasa this weekend. Coach Salome Wanjala said his charges have other commitments and they already informed the federation of their decision. "It's unfortunate, we will not be in Mombasa. We have work-related commitments and we have no choice," Salome said. "The team is training and we are optimistic to play in the fourth leg." But KVF organizing secretary, Ishmael Chege, said they are yet to receive any communication from clubs that plan to skip the Mombasa tour. "We still have two days to go but so far, there is no official communication from teams about their absence. The matches will go on as earlier planned." Nairobi Prisons were set to play newbies Vihiga County on Saturday. Only one league match was played in the first leg as Kenya Prisons tormented Nairobi Prisons 3-0 (25- 19, 25-17, and 25-20) last November. The men's leg was also played once within the same period but there are no rankings to date. The second leg was rescheduled and will be played just before the playoffs in June. Defending champions Kenya Prisons have stepped up their preparations with coach Josp Baraza exuding confidence of defending their title. "The atmosphere in training is superb and players are raring to go," he said. Elsewhere, the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) coach Daniel Bor is confident his charges will give a better performance this time around. The sleuths leave today for Mombasa, where they tackle Kenya Prisons before entertaining Kenya Army on Sunday. "They (players) are in better shape.  The team is intact with Maureen Wekesa the only absentee."
