A one-time education officer in Kericho, Andrew Malakwen, is the new Kipsigis council of elders chairman. Malakwen takes over after the demise of the former chairman, John Maiywa. At a colourful ceremony held at Moi Gardens on Monday, at least 100 Kipsigis elders endorsed Malakwen as the new chairman. Speaking after the endorsement, Malakwen regretted the erosion of Kipsigis culture, which he vowed to restore during his tenure. He said the roots of Kipsigis culture and their origin was slowly  diminishing and, unless action is taken now, the community would not have anything to be proud of. As a community, he added, the Kipsigis people have a wealth of culture that, for decades, had shielded them from committing wrong and, instead, bringing unity of purpose. "We have to call several meetings aimed at restoring some cultural values that used to keep us together as a community," Malakwen said. He further said, as a people, we have to trace our origin and establish were we came from and where we are heading to. "If we are not careful,a day will come when we will  ask ourselves where we came from." He told the political elites preparing to contest for various  seats in Kericho county to conduct their campaigns peacefully, devoid of incitements as they try to outwit their opponents. Recalling the infamous 2007/8 post election violence, Malakwen regretted how the community was referred as the aggressors against non-Kalenjins residents in county. "Our political leadership should exercise care during this electioneering period and ensure reckless tribal and political utterances are not entertained, "Malaken said. Kipsigis are a sub-tribe of the larger Kalenjin community.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
