Gilgil MP Martha Wangari has today ditched the Jubilee party for Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party. Wangari said that she had served her people diligently since 2017, and it was time to renew that mandate. “It is 2022, and I shall seek to fly the UDA party ticket in Gilgil,” she added. Gilgil MP also thanked the UDA party leader for receiving and welcoming her to the party. "Gilgil Constituency is Rutonized. Mpango ni Bottom Up. Form ni Hustler nation,” read her posts on Twitter and Facebook. She will face off with businessman William Wachira, who is eyeing the UDA ticket, and Steven Gatimu, who is yet to declare on which party he will vie on. Wangari joined politics in 2007 when she founded the 'Warembo na Kibaki Tena' group, which campaigned for retired President Mwai Kibaki's re-election in the 2007 General election. In 2013, Wangari was a nominated senator and was vocal on women and youth affairs. Political pundits argue that Wangari and other youthful female politicians will play a crucial role in the 2022 Presidential succession politics.
