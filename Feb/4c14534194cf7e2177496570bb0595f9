Kenyan Premier League giants, Gor  Mahia, have appointed experienced German tactician Andreas Spier as their new head coach. The record Kenyan champions made the announcement on their official website early Tuesday. "We are pleased to announce Andreas Spier as our new head coach,” the club said the terse statement. Spier, who is remembered for his stint as a no-nonsense former Football Kenya Federation technical director, will be deputized by the much-travelled Michael Nam. The German fills the role only a day after Ugandan tactician Paul Nkata had been appointed on an interim basis. Nkata's appointment was, however, revoked following a countrywide uproar. The Ugandan was at the helm of Kakamega Homeboyz when the club was caught up in a match-fixing scandal that left four of their players sanctioned. The changes come exactly three days after the club axed  Briton Mark Harrison and his assistants Sammy Omollo. Harrison and his team paid the price following a string of poor results in their recent matches, including the embarrassing 3-0 loss to Posta Rangers. Despite all their documented financial struggles, Gor are only six points adrift of surprise league leaders Kakamega Homeboyz.
