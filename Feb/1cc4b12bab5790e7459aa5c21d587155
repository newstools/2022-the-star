Central Organisation of Trade Unions boss Francis Atwoli, has disclosed that he contracted Covid-19 but it didn't have a major impact on him. Speaking at Tom Mboya Labor College on Tuesday, Atwoli said that the disease did not have any big impact on him because he was fully vaccinated. "I contracted Covid-19 on 30th last month but luckily I had received two doses of the vaccine, so it did not have much impact on me," he said. He called on Kenyans to continue getting vaccinated noting that the vaccines have helped a lot in containing Covid-19. Atwoli said that he was lucky he did not contract the first variant which was highly symptomatic, the second and the third variants which killed many people. "The second variant killed so many people including the chairman of my own union and so many other people died. The third variant that originated from India was the worst." He also thanked those who came up with the vaccine. This is the first time the Cotu boss has disclosed that he contracted the disease. Atwoli said the virus is here and we must always try and see how we can be able to survive after Covid-19.
