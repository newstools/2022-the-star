Bungoma senator and Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula had a rough time trying to campaign for Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa for governor seat on Wednesday in Trans Nzoia county. Wetang'ula, who was addressing a rally that was attended by deputy president William Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and several leaders allied to Kenya Kwanza, was met with pro-George Natembeya slogans. The Trans Nzoia governor race is being billed as a two horse-race between Natembeya allied to Azimio La Umoja movement and Wamalwa who is being rooted for by Kenya Kwanza Alliance. Azimio movement is led by ODM leader Raila Odinga while Ruto is the defacto leader of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. A group of youths that had pitched a tent close to the dais began chanting against the Kiminini MP when Wetang'ula began rooting for his candidature. "Chris must go! Chris Must Go! Chris Must Go!" they chanted bringing the speech session at the rally to a standstill. Efforts by Wetang'ula to calm the agitated youth appeared somewhat difficult as they continued chanting for some time until the Ford Kenya leader changed his topic of address. The DAP-K party, which is wrestling with Ford Kenya for the control of Luhya nation, welcomed the development saying residents had delivered the message "home". "Trans Nzoia County is home to peace-loving citizens who are tired of politics of lies, deceit, corruption and lack of development in the 10 years of Ford Kenya regime. The message is home. Tunatembea na Natembeya," the party stated. The Kenya Kwanza brigade was on a charm offensive in Trans Nzoia county in a bid to rally residents to back their team come August 9, polls. The team has been in the Western region for the last three days wooing the Luhya nation to back their camp.
