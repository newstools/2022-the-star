Trans-Nzoia Falcons coach Justine Okiring says the return of star striker Violet Wanyonyi from injury is a big boost to their efforts to return to winning ways. Wanyonyi, 21, trained on Wednesday with Harambee Starlets as part of the provisional squad to face Uganda's Crested Cranes in the African Women's Cup of Nations qualifier doubleheader, which is now in doubt. "She's one of our top players and a ruthless striker who strikes fear into opposition defenders because she can do anything at any given time,"  Okiring said. He added: "The national team coach has informed me that she trained with the rest of the team on Wednesday and there's been no setback. Her return to full fitness will come in handy because she gives us different dimensions in how we play. Her firepower in attack improves the whole team." The maverick striker, who has scored three goals in two matches this season, suffered a knee injury in the Falcons' 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Ulinzi Starlets a fortnight ago. Last season, she managed 21 goals for the Falcons and another five goals in the Cecafa CAF Women's Champions League qualifiers for Vihiga Queens where she was on loan. Ahead of their match with Kisumu All-Starlets, Okiring said the team need to adjust defensively and convert their chances in order to return to winning ways. The Falcons are fifth on the log and hope to finish in a respectable position even though Okiring says they are a team in transition. "At the back, we have to solve our inadequacies. The attackers need to regain their scoring boots. I left this team in 2019 a bit better but now I am forced to rebuild. Many players left for Bunyore Starlets and Kisumu," he said. If there will be no matches this weekend, Falcons plan to play friendly matches against Wiyeta Girls and Brenda High School. Last weekend, four matches were postponed to give the national team enough time to prepare.
