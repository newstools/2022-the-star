IEBC Chair Wafula Chebukati has rescheduled MP Sabina Chege's hearing sitting to March 8. The sitting was to hear and determine remarks the MP made on vote-rigging in the 2017 polls. "This committee is also alive to the constitutional safeguards requisite for a fair, just and expeditious hearing. The application for adjournment is allowed," the IEBC committee said. The IEBC warned parties involved in the matter against discussing the case in a public forum. "For the purposes of preserving the sanctity of the hearing of this case on breach of the Electoral Code and so as to avoid prejudices to the fair determination of the case, the Respondent Hon. Sabina Chege is directed to either by self or through Counsel to refrain from commenting on the case in public fora," the IEBC committee added. Chege had asked the IEBC to reschedule her 'vote rigging' case citing health conditions. Through her lawyers James Orengo, Otiende Amollo and Martin Aloo, the lawmaker asked for another date saying she is unwell and admitted to Nairobi Hospital. The case was scheduled for hearing on Tuesday morning before IEBC's Electoral Code Conduct Enforcement Committee. Otiende tabled the letter from Dr Eric Munene confirming the lawmaker is unwell. "Allow me to introduce a letter to confirm that the respondent is indisposed and was admitted on February 16 at Nairobi Hospital," Otiende said. He added: "We request that we reschedule the hearing to when she will be available." The Rarieda lawmaker also informed the Committee that they had moved to the constitutional court to get an interpretation on whether the committee chaired by Chebukati had jurisdiction over the matter.
