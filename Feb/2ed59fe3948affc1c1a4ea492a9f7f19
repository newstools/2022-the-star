Reigning African Games 20km race walk champion Emily Wamusyi Ngii wants Athletics Kenya and the National Olympics Committee of Kenya to organise more events for race walkers in the country. This, she said will offer them a competitive edge when it comes to the global stage. Ngii, who is the only woman athlete in the next month's World Race Walking Team Challenge, said they have the potential of winning medals if the AK and Nock can give them similar attention with their local track counterparts. “Kenyan race walkers have what it takes to compete at the top level and win medals but they lack proper coaches. "The authorities concerned wait until we make the national team cut before offering us coaches and other facilities hence this has stalled their progress," she noted. She said for them to realise their dreams and potential, they need build up races in both Asia and Europe. The Kenya Defence Forces athlete, who is based in Laikipia, said their participation in the World Challenge will provide them a platform to qualify for major events. “The event in Oman is a qualifier for both Commonwealth Games and World Championships and we are looking forward to great time and good results,” she said. Ngii has dominated the 20km race walking race in the country for the past five years and it was a blow for her and Samuel Gathimba when they were sidelined from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. “We had met the required time but we were told that Kenya lacks a world judge to give us the green light to the Olympics. As the only Kenyan lady in the team, she will accompany Samuel Gathimba, Africa Under-20 10,000m walk champion Samson Dominic Ndgiti and Simeon Wachira in the 20km race. Current world under-20 10,000m champion Heristone Wanyonyi will compete in junior ranks (10,000m) while former national champion Erick Shikuku will feature in masters.
