Speaker Justin Muturi has said that the fact that most of his activities and speeches revolve around Mt Kenya, does not mean that he is obsessed with the region. During the Wednesday session of #ChatWithJBMuturi, Muturi said at the end of the day, it is about equality, wellness and the best interests of the whole country. "I am not obsessed with Mt Kenya, it’s all about equality for the entire country, just because I come from the region does not mean another president cannot come from there, and the same applies to other regions," Muturi said. The speaker said if elected president, he would help fight corruption and have prevention measures on board. On how he will curb the mega scandals that have seen the country lose billions of shillings, Muturi said, "We must have a conversation on how long the corruption cases take in the Judiciary. "As president, my first job is to prevent corruption from happening by activating and empowering 80% of Kenyans who are not corrupt and by making it harder for the corrupt to hide," Muturi said. On Tuesday, Muturi said the Mt Kenya region would not beg any leader to have them in their camp. Muturi reiterated that the region is not only seeking the deputy president slot but also the country's top seat. The presidential aspirant said the region has leaders who can lead the country. "Those saying that they're looking for a running mate from the mountain should know we can also produce the president. We are not going to beg anyone to accommodate us," he said in a tweet. Last week, Muturi apologised to his devoted followers for postponing his Wednesday session of #ChatWithJBMuturi.In his tweet. Muturi informed his audience that he was held up in a 2021-2026 strategic plan launch for the office of the Auditor-General.
