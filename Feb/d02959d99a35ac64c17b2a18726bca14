Bungoma ANC chairman Martin Waliaula has dismissed claims by some aspirants of zoning in Kenya Kwanza. "I have heard of the rumours doing rounds that Bungoma county is reserved for Ford Kenya party. Let me assure our aspirants, that cannot happen," he said. Addressing the press in Kanduyi on Thursday, Waliaula accused Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula of misleading his supporters. He asked Wetang'ula to tell the aspirants that they will face ANC on the ballot. "There will be no zoning in Kenya Kwanza Alliance. Everyone is free to field candidates for governor, senator, woman rep, MP and MCA," Waliaula said. He told partner parties to brace for a tough duel. Waliaula asked aspirants planning to vie for elective posts to register with the ANC office as time was running out. "We have limited time. If you wish to vie on the ANC  ticket make sure that you clear with our offices so that you are given the green light to vie," he said. Waliaula said he was perturbed by President Uhuru Kenyatta's sentiments during the Sagana III meeting in Nyeri on Wednesday. He questioned the President's use of his mother tongue in his address. "The President is a symbol of unity, he should not turn into a tribal king because he was elected by all of Kenyans," Waliaula said. Uhuru endorsed Azimio La Kenya flagbearer Raila Odinga for President. Waliaula said Kenya Kwanza will defeat Raila in the August election. "Raila has proved to be a failure and he will be defeated and sink into political oblivion," he said. Waliaula said all presidential aspirants in Kenya Kwanza have an equal opportunity to be the alliance's flagbearer. "Our presidential candidate will be unveiled at an opportune time. At the moment talks are underway and you will soon know who will face Raila in August," he said. Edited by Tabnacha Odeny
