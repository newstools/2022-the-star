Zora actor Blessing Lung'aho, better known as Madiba from the programme, says his mother discouraged his acting career. Speaking to Buzz Central, he opened up on a time he battled depression when in his line of duty. Madiba comes from a family that treasures studies. His mother is a professor. "Everyone in my family excelled in school. We have 27 degrees. My mum knows life is to go to school, work hard and get a job." He said even when he first featured on TV, his mum discouraged him, saying that was not a job. Blessings Lung'aho is a talented actor, TV commercial model, storyteller and fitness enthusiasm. "I feel like art is a curse and you can't run away from it if you have the call. It will find you in whatever age you are," he said. "I worked as a project manager for a financial institution for almost a year and I was depressed every day. It was just not me." He also spoke about going for auditions and failing terribly. "I came to realise later that all the rejection I faced on auditions built up, and I started doubting myself, which led to anxiety," he said. "In our industry, there are no structures where you can go and share your anxiety story. I needed to work on it and even today, I actively work on it. When I get overwhelmed, I know how to handle it." He is currently one of the main characters in 'Zora', a programme on Citizen TV with a love story. He also acted as Meja in the 'Maria' series. He is also alleged to be Jackie Matubia's baby daddy.
