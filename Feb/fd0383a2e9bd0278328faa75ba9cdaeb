The law stipulates that state officers and public officers must resign at least six months before the date of the General Election. On February 3, President Uhuru Kenyatta ordered civil servants eying elective seats in the August polls to resign. In a notice issued by the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, the president directed those with political ambitions to vacate their offices before February 8, a day before the deadline set by law. Together with their resignation letters, Kinyua said all officers should provide details of work plans in progress, annotate all public assets handed over as well as issue the status of priority National development programmes and projects.
