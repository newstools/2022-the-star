Former East African community Chief Administrative Secretary Ken Obura will officially launch his campaign for Kisumu governor this week. Obura pledge to mount a structured campaign to succeed the incumbent Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o who is seeking a second term. “I will move door to door to speak to our people on the need and importance of why we should change the county leadership,”he said. Obura was on Friday unveiled as the candidate to face Nyong’o in ODM primaries in April. He was unveiled at the Central Square along Oginga Odinga Street in Kisumu. This follows a consensus reached out between former governor Jack Ranguma, Senator Fred Outa and ex-Kisumu speaker Onyango Oloo. Outa who read the resolution on behalf of the four while unveiling Obura noted that they choose a consensus  as a model recommended by ODM to name candidates ahead of the polls. Obura in his acceptance speech assured residents that he would initiate projects that will improve their livelihoods as the next governor. He however blamed the current administration for destroying the livelihoods of small scale traders following the demolition of their structures. He supported the development projects but said they should be done in a humane manner by offering alternative space for traders. "In my government, I will ensure the interest of traders, bodaboda operators and all residents are fully factored and protected," Obura said. He said that they require a leader who operates on an open door policy and has a listening ear. The Outa said that they are convinced that the Nyong’o failed to fulfil various aspiration for the people of Kisumu hence the need for change. The team have seen traversing the seven subcounties namely Nyando, Seme, Kisumu Central, Muhoroni, Kisumu East, Nyakach and Kisumu West in Kisumu to popularise their bid.
