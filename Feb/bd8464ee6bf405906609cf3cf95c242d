Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is now the most preferred running mate for deputy president William Ruto, a survey by Trends for Insights Africa says. Tifa poll indicates that despite ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi being the favourite among Kenyans to deputise Ruto, Waiguru has beaten Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua in the list of potential running mates from Mt Kenya region. Waiguru, who has declared that she is interested in defending her governor seat in the August 9 elections, scooped 15 per cent support of the respondents. She was closely followed by Gachagua who had 11 per cent support. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was also billed as Ruto's potential running mate with 8 per cent of the respondent rooting for him. The same polls also ranked Ruto as the most preferred presidential candidate at 38.7 per cent against ODM leader Raila Odinga’s 27 per cent. The poll released on Thursday shows that Ruto’s popularity rating remains unchanged since the last poll in November. However, Raila’s increased by 4 per cent. In the last three Tifa polls,  Raila was first at 8 per cent then rose to 23 per cent and now 27 per cent while Ruto was 39 per cent and has now stagnated at 38 per cent in the last two polls. The polls were held in June 2021, November 2021 and February 2022.
