Trans-Nzoia Falcons will be without four first-team players when they welcome Thika Queens at the Moi Studium, Kitale, for the crunch Kenya Women's Premier League match on Saturday. Former Vihiga Queens' forward Violet Wanyonyi is out with a knee injury after getting a knock in their 5-1 loss to Ulinzi Starlets. Despite the injury, she remains on the treatment table in the Harambee Starlets camp with Starlets' coach Alex Alumira optimistic of her return next week. Defenders Esther Uhuru and Mary Wanjala and Noel Ariku (striker) due to varied reasons. The absence of the quartet is no doubt a blow to coach Justine Okiring, who was hoping to capitalise on Thika's poor away form to bag maximum points. Both teams have 13 points but Thika are fourth owing to superior goal difference while Falcons sit fifth in the 12-team league. "I am a bit disappointed because all the absentees were injured in our last match which also affected the outcome. They are our dependable players but we have no choice but make do with the ones we have," the former Harambee Starlets coach said. "With the crowd behind us, we can maximize on the home advantage. We are on the same wavelength with Thika but the players must work for maximum points." Okiring hopes Martha Amunyolete will be available for selection. The winger is in the national team camp training at Kasarani. "I expect Amunyolete to play and help the team win," he said.
