Police in Karachuonyo are investigating the deaths of a 35-year-old man and a woman who were found dumped in a bush. The bodies of rider Vincent Ochieng’ and passenger Vivian Atieno, 20, were dumped in Misita village, Kanyadhiang, in Karachuonyo constituency. Atieno, who operates a mitumba business at Nyakwere market in the constituency, hired the motorcyclist on Monday evening to take her home after work. Atieno's family got worried when she failed to return home and they started looking for her. They did not find her. On Tuesday morning, a resident who was going to his farm discovered the two bodies. Ochieng’s neck was tied to a tree near a path. Atieno’s body was lying on the ground near Ochieng’s feet. Kanyadhiang assistant chief Melda Otieno said the two may have been killed elsewhere before their bodies were dumped at the scene. “The way Ochieng’s body was tied to the tree and his feet stepped on the ground shows he did not commit suicide but was killed elsewhere before being dumped to the place,” the administrator said. Otieno said they have liaised with police who have launched a probe into the murders.  She said they have reported the matter to Kendu Bay police station for investigations. Otieno said the people who killed the two wanted it to look like suicide. “We’re appealing to residents who might be having information about the killers to report so we can arrest them,” she said. The bodies were moved to Kendu Adventist Mission Hospital mortuary in Gendia, Karachuonyo. Edited by A.N
