Detectives based in Kiambu County are on the trail of a notorious horde that violently robbed a woman last night as she was driving into her home in Kiu-Kenda Estate, Kiambu county. According to the sleuths, the woman was retiring to her home around 9 pm when an unexpected incident happened. The house-help was closing the gate when a gang of more than five mean-looking misfits armed with a pistol and crude weapons accosted them. After ordering the terrified woman to stop, they ransacked her vehicle for valuables before entering her living room where they found her husband. The man who was caught unawares, and with their lives on the line, pleaded with the miscreants to have their way in the thievery, but spare the dear lives of his family. Thereafter, the criminals made away with a 52" TV, a home theatre, eight wrist watches, three hp laptops, and two mobile phones make Samsung Note 9. The couple's wedding rings, unestablished amount of cash, car keys, and Safaricom modems were also stolen in the robbery. As the gang continued picking the valuable items, the couple's daughter seized a rare opportunity and managed to get to the alarm undetected, sounding it. The louts were immediately sent into panicky mode as they scampered from the scene, carrying with them the stolen items. No one was harmed during the incident. The operation has been heightened, with Kiamumbi-based detectives burning the midnight candle to ensure the assailants are brought to book.
