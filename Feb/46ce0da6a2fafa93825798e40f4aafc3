The Salaries and Remuneration Commission has suggested a radical change in the way unions and employers negotiate perks. Every employer must, if their proposals succeed, now get SRC advice before initiating talks with union representatives. Unions and employers in the public sector, like the teachers' Knut or lecturers' Uasu, have conducted long-drawn and time-consuming but always mutually accepted negotiations in the long run. Employers with a history of negotiations with unions have developed the capacity to negotiate and are aware of the parameters they must follow in the process. One of the suggestions in the proposals is for public firms to provide the SRC with financial information that indicates the financial health of the institution. The public sector is riven with red tape and appalling bureaucracy. The inclusion of the SRC will slow down negotiations to a whole new level. The SRC should limit itself to providing guidelines and not joining the negotiation table on behalf of public institutions. The unions and the employers should not be bogged down by a new batch of bureaucrats who will definitely not add value. No parastatal is insane enough to promise and agree to deals for money it cannot pay. Quote of the Day: "Be a yardstick of quality.
