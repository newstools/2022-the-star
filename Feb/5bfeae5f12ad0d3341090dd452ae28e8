New talent Alfred Kipkemoi is hopeful that a good performance at Saturday's Mt. Kenya Mountain Running Championship will earn him a deal with a management company. Kipkemoi will be making his maiden appearance in mountain running and is praying that training alongside New York City Marathon champion Albert Korir will bear fruits. “I want to post good results in Meru in order to attract managers who can take care of my career. These training mates have offered me good training and I want to do well just as they are in their career," Kipkemoi said. The Elgeyo Marakwet native has thus far competed in two races — the Discovery Kenya Cross Country Championships where he finished 15th and the Iten 10km Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign where he came 20th. "I have only run two races and heading into the Meru race, I want to try another challenge in my life and career. I want to try my best to be like the top athletes in this country. The journey to success has begun and this will be great for me," Kipkemoi, 20, said. Elsewhere, the course for the one-day championship has been marked and is ready for use on Saturday. Mt Kenya Mountain Running Championship, technical committee chairman, Douglas Wakiihuri, said they are now only clearing bushes around the parking area and mounting the communication systems. “So far the route is done and we expect a good championship come Saturday morning. We are setting up a command centre under the guidance of Lewa Conservancy,” the 1987 World Marathon champion said. Wakiihuri added that they want to enjoy the good weather of Meru and run a complete race for both the elites and junior runners as well as corporates. “We are praying for good weather so that everyone can run and complete the one-loop course of 13km for senior men and women elite runners, the 8km for youth, and 2km for the fans and whoever feels they can run to keep that doctor away,” he said.
