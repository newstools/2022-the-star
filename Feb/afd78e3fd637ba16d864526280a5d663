Bandits last evening shot and killed a teacher in Kerio Valley just two days after 13 students and two teachers were injured in another attack in the same area. The deceased was a teacher at Kipyebo Primary School and worked as a catechist at the local Catholic Church. He had preached at the Kipyebo Catholic Church on Sunday and was on his way home when he was attacked. Last Friday, bandits attacked a convoy of school buses, killing one driver. The buses were ferrying students of Tot Secondary school from a trip when then they were ambushed on Friday night as they returned to their school. Twelve students and two teachers are still in the hospital. “We are quite saddened by the situation and despite all the promises by CS Fred Matiang'i the attacks are still happening,” said Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen. He condemned the killing of the teacher. Governors in the region led by Jackson Mandago of Uasin Gishu, who is also the chairman of the North Rift Economic Block, have condemned the latest killing and urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene to restore security in the region. “We are now asking President Kenyatta, who is the commander in chief of the armed forces to intervene,” said Mandago. He said children in the region must be enabled to go to school and sit for national examinations set for next month. Rift Valley regional commissioner Maalim Mohammed said all measures were being put in place to ensure security is restored in the region. “We will not make public what we are doing, but the results will be seen and felt,” said Mohammed. He said bandits using part of the Tiaty Constituency as a hideout would face action.
