Ford Kenya and DAP-K party are locked in a fierce battle for control Bungoma county politics. DAP-K has accused Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula of recruiting their members. During one of his first rallies after formation of the DAP-K, Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa allegedly admitted he was behind the Ford Kenya leadership coup. "When I saw my brothers Eseli [Simiyu] and [Wafula] Wamunyinyi being pushed to the wall in the Ford Kenya I came to their rescue,"Eugene said. He has been accused of trying to poach Bungoma MCAs allied to Wetang'ula. Wetang'ula on the other hand has been attacking the DAP-K,  terming it an extension of ODM. He urged residents to reject DAP-K. "When you see them here with that party just know they are ODM B and reject them," Wetang'ula said on Wednesday during an aspirants' meeting in Bungoma. The senator has since moved with speed to return some MCAs who had decamped to DAP-K. They include Charles Nangulu of Namwela and Rosemary Khisa of Luhya Bwake. While DAP-K has settled for Governor Wycliffe Wangamati for the Bungoma seat, Ford Kenya is fronting Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka. After joining Kenya Kwanza, Wetang'ula now enjoys the support of several  MPs in the region, including Didmus Barasa (Kimilili), Dan Wanyama (Webuye West), Fred Kapondi (Mt Elgon) and Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula). DAP-K has only six MCAs campaigning for them in Bungoma. They include Florence Fulano (Maeni), Aggrey Mulongo(Kibingei), Milly Masungo (Misikhu), Luseneka Namunyu (Bukembe West), Joan Lutukai (Kabuyefwe)  and Elvis Ambuka (Milima). Bungoma county assembly has  60 MCAs. Political analyst Isaac Wanjekeche opines that the two parties will be seeking to outsmart each other in the forthcoming elections. “Eugene will be seeking to prove that he is the new political kingpin of the region while Wetang'ula  wants to cement his role as the political supremo of Bungoma,” Wanjekeche said.
