The One Kenya Alliance (Oka) principals are on Wednesday expected to sign a pact officially committing to work together under the alliance ahead of the general election. The event is set to be held at Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka Command Center in Karen, Nairobi, where the partners are expected to sign a deed of assignment. The deal will allow Gideon Moi's Kanu, Cyrus Jirongo's UDP and Martha Karua's Narc Kenya to officially become part of the alliance. The One Kenya Alliance name was reserved by Wiper, implying that Kalonzo's party currently has the exclusive legal right to the name. "After signing this agreement, all the partners will now be free to claim the name Oka, " a source told the Star. Already, officials and members of parliament allied to the parties have arrived at the event. They include Makueni senator Mutula Kilonzo Jr (Wiper), Kanu secretary general Nick Salat and Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu (Wiper). The Oka bosses are also expected to unveil the new technical team following the exit of Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress ( ANC). The team will revisit the coalition agreement documents and rework the formula for identifying a presidential flagbearer after the sudden exit of Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula. Last month, the then technical team handed over its report to the principals after a three-day retreat at Lake Elementaita resort. Mudavadi skipped the event. It emerged from the retreat that Kalonzo dwarfed Mudavadi in at least three of the four scenarios fronted by the team in the report.
