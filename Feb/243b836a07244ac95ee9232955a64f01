Deputy President William Ruto on Monday was in Busia County as part of his scaled-up efforts to have the region solidly behind him. Leading the Kenya Kwanza alliance campaigns alongside ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula Ruto, made stopovers in Nambale,  Butula and Mubwayo Grounds in Budalangi. The trio is on a three-day charm offensive of the Western region which began in Vihiga on Sunday, during Mudavadi's homecoming. They were accompanied by a host of sitting and aspiring MPs allied to them. The Mps include Sakwa Bunyasi (Nambale), Malulu Injendi (Malava), Majimbo Kalasinga (Kabuchai), Cleophas Malala (Kakamega), Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Tandaza Sawa (Matuga). Foreign Affairs CAS Ababu Namwamba, UDA Party Chairman Johnson Muthama and a host of MCAs and aspirants in Malaba and Nambale in Busia County were also in the motorcade. Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza Alliance brigade raided Vihiga county for a series of campaign rallies on Friday. The DP visited the area to grace Mudavadi's homecoming at Vihiga cultural grounds a fortnight after he declared willingness to work with him. Ruto, in his address, said he has no problem with both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila saying he has backed them before. "I have backed both Raila and Uhuru for the presidency. I have no problem with them at all. But this time I am after addressing the needs of the hustlers," he said Mudavadi on his part said: "We are tired of supporting Raila, it's time we part ways. If they cannot support us we shall talk with voters to stand with us come August 9, general elections". Wetang'ula shared similar sentiments with his colleagues saying they have backed Raila enough times and asked Western residents to put him aside this time around. "There are people we have been siding with but they are not grateful for our support. We back them but they end up treating us like trash," he said.
