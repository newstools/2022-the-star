President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni of Uganda says his country’s cordial relationship with its neighbour Kenya will remain irrespective of who becomes the next president in the August 9, elections. Museveni said his government will work with any person who will be elected by Kenyans as their next president. “I expressed that Uganda’s cordial relationship with Kenya remains our priority irrespective of who the Kenyans vote for President in their upcoming elections. We shall work with whoever is elected by the people,” Museveni said. He spoke on Tuesday at State House, in Entebbe, when he met the outgoing Kenyan Ambassador to Uganda Kiema Kilonzo. Kilonzo resigned from his diplomatic role after three years to venture into Kenyan politics. He had earlier expressed his interest in the Kitui gubernatorial seat, a post being held by Governor Charity Ngilu who is on her first term. President Museveni has been a close friend to Deputy President William Ruto and had invited him to Uganda last year during the launch of the government project. He has also been working closely with President Uhuru Kenyatta. A number of government officials in Kenya have tendered their resignation letters as they prepare to vie for various political seats in the August 9, elections.
