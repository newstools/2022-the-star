The state salaries’ agency has released new Daily Subsistence Allowances (DSA) for the local travel and the per diem rates for Nakuru City. This follows the move to confer Nakuru to city status last year. Nakuru was elevated from County headquarters to City status on December 1, 2021, and the Salaries and Remuneration Commission has moved to include it among the other cities- Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. SRC chairperson Lyn Mengich said the review shall apply to all state and other public officers in the Public Service both at National and County governments and that all existing circulars on the same subject cease to apply from February 2, 2022. “The respective accounting officers are required to ensure prudent management of this facilitative allowance,” she said in the memo to various government departments. SRC is mandated to set and regularly review the remuneration and benefits of State officers and to advise the national and county governments on the remuneration, and benefits of all other public officers. The advice of the Commission is a mandatory prerequisite in the determination of remuneration and benefits for all public officers as provided through the legal interpretation of Article 259(11) of the Constitution. According to the memo dated February 2, Cluster 1 (entails Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nakuru). State officer grades F4 get Sh22,000, Job Group U-V for state officer grades F1, F2, and E5, will get Sh18,200, Job Group S-T for state officer grades E3, E4 will receive Sh16,800, Job Group P-R for state officer grades E2, E1, and D5 will earn Sh14,000, Job Group K-N for state officer grades D4 will receive Sh11, 200.Job Group F-J will get Sh6,300 while Job Group A-E earn Sh4,000.

The civil servants face drastic pay cuts starting April this year following an advisory of SRC reducing allowances from 247 to five. Workers in public service institutions will, from April 30, 2022, only earn house, commuter, job-related, task-related and labour market adjustment allowances. Even so, the salaries agency would regularly review the extra perks taking into account their affordability and fiscal sustainability.
