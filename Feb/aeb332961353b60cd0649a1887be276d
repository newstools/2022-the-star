With the new Google update, things are about to look a bit different when you next open your email. “We’re introducing a new, integrated view for Gmail, making it easy to move between critical applications like Gmail, Chat and Meet in one unified location,” Google said. This change is expected to be from February 8, as it will roll out the availability gradually this month. If you don’t like the new look, you have an option to switch to the old layout but all this will be short-lived until April. The company said that it hopes the new experience will make it easier for people to “Stay on top of what is important” and get work done faster. The company says that notification bubbles for the other apps will popup too. For someone who likes thigs in one place, he or she will find this new move helpful, but others may find it distracting and may prefer to keep thigs separate. The actual goal of the update is to lure its customers from Zoom and Microsoft Teams usage that comes with its business users. “You will also see email and chat results when using the search bar, making it easier to find what you need by eliminating the need to search within a specific product,” they said. Today, you can turn off Google Chat and Google Meet in the Gmail settings. It's not yet clear how many of these features can be turned off if you don't like them but you have the option till June, or when Google announces other changes.
