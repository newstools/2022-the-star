Kiss FM's Jalango apologised to Arrow Bwoy and his girlfriend Nadia Mukami for revealing their pregnancy to the public. Speaking in a radio interview, Arrow Bwoy said he has made up with Jalang'o. "Jalas is a friend and someone who has supported me from day one," he said. "We still talk but he crossed his boundaries at that time. He apologised and said sorry for what he did. I do not like keeping grudges nor do I burn bridges." Jalang'o had during the Morning Kiss asked Nadia to stop hiding her baby bump by wearing baggy clothes. Nadia said she felt betrayed, terming it "low, disrespectful and demeaning" in an Instagram video. She confirmed she was pregnant with Arrow Bwoy but lost the baby.
