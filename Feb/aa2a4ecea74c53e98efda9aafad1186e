Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday took the Uchumi Kwanza agenda to the people of Tseikuru in Mwingi North and Mathuki-Mui in Mwingi Central, Kitui County. Tseikuru is the home of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. Ruto who led the Kenya Kwanza Alliance rally was accompanied by Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya) and UDA Chairman Johnson Muthama. He, however, said the ODM lead should step forward and face him instead of competing him in the shadows of the President. Other leaders present were MPs Nimrod Mbai (Kitui East), Vincent Musyoka (Mwala), Kithure Kindikii (Tharaka Nithi), former Nairobi deputy governor Jonathan Mueke and a host of MCAs and aspirants. Ruto said the August general election will pit those that are for the creation of jobs and enterprise expansion for ordinary Kenyans against believers of patronage, trickle-down economic approach and handouts, adding "Kenyans will decide." The DP also weighed in on President Uhuru Kenyatta's endorsement of the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the Presidency. Uhuru on Wednesday backed Raila for the top seat during his Sagana III meeting saying Ruto is not qualified to lead Kenya. Ruto said he respects the President's decision to back the former Prime Minister.
