Northeastern National Aids Control Council coordinator Wario Boru has expressed concern over high rate of mother to child HIV transmission. Boru revealed this on Thursday at a Garissa hotel during a one-day sensitisation workshop on HIV/AIDS. The event brought together journalists, police, Judiciary and health officials. Boru said the transmission rate currently stands at 28.5 per cent, the highest in the country. The meeting was organised by WEFKO - a support group formed by community based organisations. The coordinator said there is need for concerted effort to ensure mothers attend antenatal  clinic and deliver safely in health facilities. Boru said when an expectant mother goes to the clinic early it is easy to detected her condition and start medication where necessary. He said there was need to enhance awareness at the community level ,fight stigma and discrimination which he said were contributing factors to the high infection rate in Northeastern. “This should worry us if its happening in this day and age, the biggest problem is that most expectant mothers are not attending their antenatal care sessions,” Boru said. Boru further said the stigma index in the region remains the highest in the country and that needs to change through sensitisation and talk shows. He disclosed that the stigma is so serious that those who are HIV positive use pen names in their files to conceal their identities. It also emerged that a high number of employers in the region are subjecting their would be house helps to forced HIV tests. Boru said this was an infringement to ones basic rights and should not be condoned.
