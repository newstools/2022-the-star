ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday evening visited Murang’a Woman Representative Sabina Chege at Nairobi Hospital where she is receiving treatment. Raila was accompanied by a host of MP including Kanini Kega (Kieni), Junet Mohamed  (Suna East), Mishi Mboko (Likoni) and Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay county). Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho and Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina were present. The leaders expressed their kind messages to the female MP wishing her a quick recovery. "Wishing my friend and sister Hon. Sabina Wanjiru wa Chege a quick recovery #NiSiSi #GetWellSoon," Wanga said after sharing images of the visit. The MP was admitted to the Nairobi Hospital on February 16, according to her lawyer Otiende Amollo. The revelations of her sickness were made by Lawyer Omollo who told the IEBC committee, that was bound to hear her vote-rigging case, she couldn't appear because of sickness. Amollo presented a letter from Dr Eric Munene confirming the lawmaker is unwell. "Allow me to introduce a letter to confirm that the respondent is indisposed and was admitted on February 16 at Nairobi Hospital," Otiende said. He added: "We request that we reschedule the hearing to when she will be available." The hearing of the case was scheduled for March 8.
