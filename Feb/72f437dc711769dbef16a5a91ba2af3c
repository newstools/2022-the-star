Kayole Starlets coach Joshua Sakwa has admitted that his charges must turn around their fortunes if they are to survive relegation in the Kenya Women Premier League. Despite beating Nakuru City Queens 3-2 over the weekend to end their three-match winless run, Kayole are not out of the woods yet. They are eighth in the 12-team league with nine points having played one game more. Inability to convert their chances and a leaky defence leaves Sakwa's work cut out. "There's no running away from the fact that our recent performances are worrying with the relegation battle getting tighter. We badly need results and it's time for the players to prove their worth," Sakwa said. Previously, Kayole lost 2-0 to Wadadia at Mumias Sports Complex. A 4-0 battering in the hands of newbies Bunyore Starlets signaled the monumental task awaiting Sakwa even though a 6-0 thrashing by three-time former ruthless champions Vihiga Queens wasn't surprising. Sakwa rung changes to his squad, giving those who hadn't played much the chance to impress and they did not disappoint. Sakwa said players should embrace competition and fight for their place in the team. "Players need to get out of their comfort zones and seize their chance. I reshuffled the pack and no player is indispensable because the captain was also out. We play Ulinzi next and our target is at least a point." In the meantime, Sakwa wants the FKF Caretaker Committee to come out clean and reveal the fate of Harambee Starlets as far as the African Women's Cup of Nations qualifier match against Uganda is concerned. "A lot has been said about the match but nobody has given the clearest information so far. The Caretaker Committee should come out and tell us the way forward." He added: "Players need platforms like the national team to prove themselves and earn moves abroad."
