Ginger ale is a drink we have for sure heard in movies and series a couple of times and thought, oh, what a fancy drink. But tell you the truth, it’s a ‘fancy’ drink that you can make at the comfort of your home with only 3 basic ingredients. Grated ginger, lime and ice cubes. Several years ago in the 1850s in Ireland, this carbonated non-alcoholic drink was invented by the Irish and is commonly used in cocktails in Moscow. Ingredients For syrup Preparation Step 1 Over medium heat, in a sufuria, boil the 2 cups of water and add ginger. Step 2 Reduce the heat to low, let the ginger sit for 5 minutes before removing from heat Step 3 Let it cool for 20 minutes or less, depending on how mild or strong you want it to be. Then strain the liquid in a jag. Step 4 In a different pan, mix the sugar and water then boil to create the syrup. Step 5 Put ice cubes in glasses, pour in the ginger ale. Followed by the syrup, then club soda. Squeeze in lime for that extra flavour and serve. *Adding a shot of vodka for those that prefer alcoholic drinks is also workable. * Using cranberry or passion juice instead of club soda
