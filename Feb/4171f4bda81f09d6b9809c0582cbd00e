Presidential hopeful and businessman Jimi Wanjgi was on Sunday installed as a Luo elder in Kabondo Kasipul, Homa Bay County. "It’s a responsibility I don’t take lightly, on my quest to Liberate Kenya," Wanjigi said. Speaking during the event, Wanjigi questioned President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee party intention for ODM. He asked the residents to reject Jubilee's plot to ODM for its benefit. "I do not want ODM to be diluted during this election period. Tunashikana aje na mtu tulishinda 2017. Na yeye hayuko kwa ballot. How are we now friends with Jubilee whose polcies we opposed in 2017?" Wanjigi said. "Hata hio Azimio naona rangi ya Jubilee. Naona red na blue. Haki yetu iko wapi. Orange iko wapi? Kwani ni Jubilee inaendelea ama ni ODM? Ni kama Jubilee inawekwa juu na Chungwa inapotea. Tuseme ukweli." "Loose translation, "In Azimio, I only see red and blue colours, no orange. Where is our right? I Jubilee the one going up or ODM? Seems like Jubilee is being given priority and ODM is lost. Lets be honest." Mzee wangu tunamheshimu kabisa kabisa. Ametupigania ukombozi wa pili sawa sawa. Lakini kuendesaha mambo ya Jubilee, hapo ndio mimi nasema hapana," Wanjigi said. Loose translation, "We respect Raila a lot. He has fought for our second liberation. However, driving the agendas of Jubilee is where I say no'. Deputy President William Ruto and his allies have severally described Raila as Uhuru’s puppet who will serve a few billionaires instead of a majority of Kenyans if elected. The Azimio team from Jubilee have denied this claim saying Raila cannot be anybody’s project. Lamu Woman Representative Zuleikha Juma told off the Ruto brigade over the project tag insisting Raila has been consistent in his resolve to liberate the country.
