Four police officers attached to Lang’ata’s Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)  were Monday freed on a Sh300,000 cash bail after allegedly abducting a man and forcefully obtaining money from him. Anthony Muvaka Mwanza, Cornelius Stephene Wambua, Tom Omomdi Otieno, and Kennedy Omondi Odero were charged with robbery with violence when they appeared before a Nairobi court on Monday. The four officers are accused of robbing Vincent Ochieng Odembo of Sh40,000 shillings and $2,400 (Sh272, 260) on February 6 at Nextgen Mall on Mombasa Road while armed with AK-47 rifles. They were granted a bond of Sh500,000 and surety of the same amount or cash bail of Sh300,000 pending hearing. The DCI said one of the officers transferred Sh40,000 from the victim's M-Pesa account to his own. "They then proceeded to the victim’s apartment where they took a further $2,400 (Sh272, 260) from him, before dumping him at Choma Zone located at Total petrol station along Mombasa Road.” The victim went to the Akila police station the next day to report the incident, only to find the vehicle he had been bundled into there. He then rushed to the Serious Crimes Unit at the DCI’s headquarters where he reported and investigations were launched. The detectives established that the vehicle indeed belonged to DCI Lang’ata. DCI George Kinoti said the actions were isolated cases that do not reflect the sleuth's agency's mandate to serve and protect Kenyans in any way.
