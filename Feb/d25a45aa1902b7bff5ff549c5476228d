Nominated MP David Sankok on Tuesday stunned his colleagues in parliament after he ditched his signature green suit for a black one. The move sparked excitement among members of parliament, so much so, that speaker Justin Muturi had to interrupt the house business to comment on his dress code. "Today there is a lot of excitement in the house. I suspect it has something to do with today's unusual attire of the Hon. Sankok. He is exceptionally smart," Speaker Mutri said amidst laughter from MPs. Sankok stood and welcomed the positive acknowledgements from his colleagues. Here is the video courtesy of KBC: Sankok, who represents people with disabilities at the National Assembly, is known for his green Kaunda suit. The suit is decorated with black, white and red stripes at the sleeves and shoulder in a manner that appears as Kenya's national flag. The MP is in love with the colours such that his house, business premises is painted in green colour and decorated with red, black and white stripes. According to the MP, his choice of colours was influenced by his desire to create a political brand while the national flags' colours signify his love for Kenya.
