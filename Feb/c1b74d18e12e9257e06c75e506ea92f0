Nondies head coach Willis Ojal said they will tweak their game plan for Saturday's must-win Kenya Cup clash against Mwamba. Kenya's most decorated rugby club sit bottom of the table with seven points with three games to the end of the campaign, Ojal will be looking to outsmart  Mwamba on Saturday. "We know Mwamba love running the ball and taking quick penalties and are a dangerous side.  We must, therefore, ensure we win the battle upfront and deny them space to run and defend well,” said Ojal Known for their famous white shirts, the Ngong road-based side have only won one game this season losing seven. Ojal said the club must be resilient in their final three games of the season if they are to stay up for next season. “It's been a tough season and we tend to lack composure in most matches.  A case in point is a fortnight ago when we were leading Nakuru 22-6 at halftime only to lose 23-22. It hurts,” said Ojal. The tactician said the mood in the team is good and expressed confidence that they can also win their two final matches against Impala and Homeboyz. "The mood and morale is great and the boys have promised to win the final three games of the season and keep our status for next season," he noted. Eight points separate Mwamba who are currently placed fifth and Nondies bottom of the table (12th). Ojal said the clubs in those positions are fighting for survival and the final three weeks of the season promises to be thrilling. "The clubs in those positions are not safe and have no choice but to fight off relegation," he added. Impala, Nakuru, and Homeboyz sit perilously close to the relegation zone and face an anxious final few weeks of the season. The top four positions are occupied by Kabras, champions KCB, Menengai Oilers, and Strathmore Leos. The bottom two will be relegated at the end of the season.
