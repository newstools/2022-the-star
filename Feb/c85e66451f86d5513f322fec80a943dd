Zimbabwe’s Visitor Mapwanya fired a stunning eight-under-par 64 on Day Two of the seventh leg of Safari Tour Season Four to storm to the top of the leaderboard alongside Thika Sports Club’s Simon Ngige. The Zim pro didn’t just overshadow his compatriot Robinson Chinhoi but made his intentions known ahead of the penultimate round on Tuesday. Ngige and Mapwanya are among 20 players who made the cut. Mapwanya, who collected 10 pars and eight birdies, four in each half in the bogey-free round, said he was encouraged by the great condition of the course, which offered players a great chance of low-scoring rounds compared to Limuru a week ago. “I really enjoyed playing on this course though I must say my game was well balanced today, where I made 23 putts. Putting and approach shots were however my strength,’’ said Mapwanya, adding: “I think I am in a position to win at least one event this season with the way my game is added.” He birdied the first, second, eighth and ninth while at the back nine, the Zimbabwean made birdies at the 11th, 12th, 15th and 18th. Meanwhile, Day One leader Ngige dropped a shot at the 17th but he had made four birdies at the opening nine in addition to the three birdies at the back nine’s 13th, 14th and 15th for a second successive 66, to also close the day on 12-under-par. “I am happy I was able to keep my cool again today to play six-under-par. My game plan has been to take off well from the tee and make it to the green on regulation because that gives me a good chance to score. The course is playing well and obviously giving us a good chance to score,” said Ngige, who is chasing his maiden Safari Tour victory. Staying close to the two is Chinhoi, who shot five-under-par-67 for a total of eight-par-136 to remain with a chance to attack for top spot in the remaining two rounds of the Sh2million-rich event. “I had a solid round despite dropping shots at the eighth, ninth and 16th holes. I over-charged when I had a bad tee shot at the 16th but I still feel I have a chance of winning this one. I have that confidence, which is good as we approach the Kenya Open,” said Chinhoi. Three other players were tied on six-under-par-138, where the cut was decided on level par aggregate. They include Nigeria’s Sunday Olapade, Dismas Indiza and Zambia’s Sydney Wemba.
