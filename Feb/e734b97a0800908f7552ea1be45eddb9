COTU secretary-general Francis Atwoli wants more discussion on the issue of health workers in the country. Atwoli said there is a need for health workers to be controlled by the National Government instead of the County Government. While making his speech on Monday during the launch of the Universal Health Coverage in Mombasa County, Atwoli said that issues ranging from salary delay are affecting health workers from giving their best. He said that Namibia, a country that got its independence in 1990 is among the countries that are inviting the majority of Kenyan health workers to go and work for them. “They are now inviting our young doctors to join them there because of small problems we have had with county governments managing this cadre of employees,” Atwoli said. He continued that: “I would urge us to sober up, sit down and see whether these professionals can remain under our national government so that they are assured of their salary.” Atwoli said that while devolution is working, it still has some gaps that need to be filled. He said that the long process that the money to counties takes including being approved by the Senate makes the health workers suffer yet they have needs to attend to. “Let’s look at it so that we don’t lose them. We don’t want to lose our young doctors.” Atwoli also said that as a champion of the workers union, he has the right to ensure that the right president takes over the seat on the August 9, elections. The Cotu boss said that there is a need to ensure that the Building Bridges Initiative becomes a reality, adding that it will be for the good of the country.
