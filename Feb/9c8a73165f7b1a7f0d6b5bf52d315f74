The leadership of Mandera county led by governor Ali Roba and his UDM party are set to join the Azimio La Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. County Assembly Speaker Mohamud Khalif is also among the leaders who back the move to support Raila. UDM Secretary-General David Ohito told Nation that consultation among party members is ongoing ahead of the official declaration. A public announcement on the same is slated for Tuesday, February 8, 2022. "UDM has seen good traction. We are doing lots of backroom consultations with various leaders across the country. We will make an announcement and parade our team next week," Ohito said. Roba, who is serving his second and last term, is eyeing the Mandera senate seat. His bid was endorsed by elders. Marsabit Governor Mohamud Ali is also a party to UDM. UDM party move to join Raila now complicates the DP's chances of taking control of the North-Eastern region considering that many leaders are backing his fierce competitor Raila. Another party UPYA led by Treasury CS Ukur Yattani is also backing the ODM leader for the top seat.
