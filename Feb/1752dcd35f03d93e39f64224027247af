President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday sent a message of condolence to the family of Senator Beth Mugo following the death of her husband, Nicholas Muratha Mugo. Eighty-five-year-old Nicholas Mugo passed on Thursday morning at a Nairobi hospital where he was undergoing treatment. In his message of comfort and encouragement to the family, the President described the late Mugo as a patriotic and dedicated person who was among the few Kenyans that played a leading role in laying a firm foundation for the country’s progress. “We will forever cherish Mr Nicholas Mugo’s contribution in laying a strong foundation for this country’s progress. We appreciate that during our early days of independence, he was able to represent our nation as a diplomat in the United Kingdom and later at the UN General Assembly where, together with other Kenyans, he effectively represented Kenya’s interests at the global arena,” President Uhuru said. The President prayed to God to give the family comfort and fortitude to bear the loss. “At this hour of mourning, I pray that the Almighty God will give Senator Beth Mugo and her family the strength and grace to bear the loss of their patriarch,” he said. Mugo said that her husband's remains will be interred on Friday at an undisclosed location. “There will be a private interment tomorrow, Friday the 4th February 2022.  The date of his memorial service will be announced later” she said. “It is with profound sadness and sorrow, I wish to announce the death of my husband, Amb. Nicholas Mugo, that happened early this morning at the Nairobi Hospital after a long illness,” she said in a statement. The senator is President Uhuru Kenyatta’s first cousin.
