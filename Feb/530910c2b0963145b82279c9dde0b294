The traditional margarita is a Mexican and American drink that dates back to the 1930s. The first known publication of the recipe dates back to the 1950s when the recipe called for an ounce of tequila, a dash of triple sec and squeezed lime juice. These original ingredients normally included tequila, triple sec and lime juice but over the years, the flavours have developed and can find tons of variations of this drink. February 22nd is a day set aside for celebrating this tasty drink. Margarita is a Spanish word that means ‘Daisy’ which is a nickname for Margaret. Margaritas are popular because, in addition to sweet and sour flavours, it includes salt. Traditional margarita glasses are wide-rimmed and stemmed, for example, a champagne coupe.
