Deputy President William Ruto has fired back at his boss Uhuru Kenyatta over remarks he made that apparently referred to him and his political camp as 'wakora'. The president during the Jubilee Party NDC at KICC, Nairobi, expressed his commitment to uniting the Azimio la Umoja coalition so that they can form a force that will "crash some wakoras". Sensing that the remarks were ostensibly directed at him, Ruto during a Nyeri Town meeting on Saturday had a response for the President. The DP told off his boss asking him to have some respect considering that it is him and his allies who made him the President. Ruto said the Azimio camp that President Uhuru is now courting has never contributed to his political successes. "Ata kama wanatuita wakora, I want to tell them to have some respect. Kueni na heshima kidogo, ni sisi tulimfanya Uhuru akawa Rais kwa hivyo mutuheshimu," he said. Loosely translates to: " Even if they are calling us conmen, I want to tell them to have some respect. Have some respect, it is us who made Uhuru President, so respect us". President Uhuru on Sunday went bare-knuckle of his deputy accusing him of being over-ambitious that he forgot his duties and responsibilities that he was elected to do. He said he had to seek the help of Raila and the opposition to have his government steadily on the development path. He urged the opposition parties to unite and form an alliance that will ensure they win come August 9, polls.
