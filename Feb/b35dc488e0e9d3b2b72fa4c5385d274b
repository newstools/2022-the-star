Three people were charged at the Milimani Law courts with forgery of KRA VIP stickers, uttering false documents and obtaining money by false pretence. David Ogola, Paul Maina and Jacob Omondi, pleaded not guilty to the offence before Chief Magistrate Winnie Kagendo and were released on a cash bail of Sh60,000 or a bond of Sh100,000. The three were arrested within Nairobi Central Business District in operations conducted by KRA County Revenue Officer. The officers encountered motor vehicles that had been affixed with VIP parking stickers on the windscreen and for which parking fees had not been paid. Upon verification of the stickers, it was established that they were fake and the suspects, who were identified by the owners of the vehicles as the people who had sold the stickers to them, were arrested. The matter will be mentioned in court on February 17, 2022. While the Authority has embarked on investigations to identify other perpetrators of the fraudulent scheme, Kenyans have been notified that the annual VIP stickers for authorised vehicles are managed through the Nairobi Revenue System (NRS) parking system. A list of all vehicles that qualify for the sticker has been uploaded to the system. Kenyans are therefore advised to verify that the stickers displayed on their vehicles are valid to avoid clamping and impounding of their vehicles.
