ODM leader Raila Odinga was hopeful that this ANC counterpart Musalia Mudavadi would move to his camp ahead of the August 9, elections. Speaking during the funeral of his stepmother on December 18, last year, Raila exuded confidence that they will reunite with Musalia. But he was wrong. The ANC leader was already engaging the DP on modalities of working together. The move seemingly rattled Raila who has lately fired a scathing attack on Mudavadi and his new buddies.
