Scientists in South Africa have produced a copy of the Moderna Covid vaccine, raising the prospect of wider access to jabs in poorer parts of the world. Researchers in Cape Town backed by the World Health Organization hope to begin human trials in November. They've used publicly available information to produce the mRNA vaccine which uses fragments of the genetic code of the coronavirus. Moderna had previously said that it would not enforce the patent on its vaccine, but stopped short of offering help to the South African project. It's hoped that locally produced Covid jabs could sharply increase vaccination rates across Africa, which are the lowest in the world. The South African team has offered to help scientists in Latin America to make their own version.
