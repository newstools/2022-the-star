Samsung yesterday announced its plans to launch the Galaxy S22 series in the metaverse, in what appears to be a complex marketing push, as it is the first year the company will bring metaverse into play. The company said it cannot hold a live conference with its audience, and that it sent out emails on Monday, for people, especially Samsung users, to register and get to watch the virtual event on Wednesday at 10 am. Those that will not have registered will have to live stream from YouTube. The ‘Event’ Users that will get to experience the virtual launch will be immersed in a virtual re-creation of its downtown New York City, a location called 837X (the physical address is 837 Washington St.). Their users will sign up using their cryptocurrency wallet for access to full features. However, one can also sign in as a guest, you get to design your avatar. This includes hairstyles, clothing, and accessories, among others. Then you get to use your keyboard and mouse to navigate the 360-degree environment, called Decentraland, 837X, a 3D virtual world browser. The players will be given a quest to hunt for 10 recyclable product boxes in and around the building. Combine them to upscale them into “something magical”. Once they complete the quest, they will each get a seed that they will plant in the sustainability forest, not a real place, but a digital world in the Samsung metaverse. The seed will give the user a special NFT Badge and users will return to the Samsung metaverse on February 14th, yes, Valentine’s day. Samsung and NFT Once users go back, the aim will be to finish the quest and get the user an NFT Badge that will display the user’s love for the forest at the same time, offering surprises along the way. “Also do expect a second Easter egg hunt that will yield another exclusive NFT badge,” they said.
