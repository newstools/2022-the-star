ODM leader Raila Odinga is on the fourth day of his tour of Coast region counties, where he will tour Taita Taveta county. The former Prime Minister who is expected to hold a rally in the county will sell his bid for the country's top job. This will be the ODM leader's fifth stab at the presidency. He started his tour of the Coast on Saturday with Kilifi county, soon after returning from a 10-day trip abroad. Raila later went to Mombasa on Sunday and Kwale on Monday. Deputy President William Ruto who was also on a six-day charm offensive of Central Kenya will on Tuesday take a strategy break. Last week, Ruto alongside his Kenya Kwanza alliance partners toured Kiambu, Kajiado, Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Meru among other counties where they sold their bottom-up economic agenda. Both Ruto and Raila are seeking to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta.
