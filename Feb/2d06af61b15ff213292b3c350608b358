The Federation of Women Lawyers(FIDA-Kenya) has condemned the Kerio Valley attack that left a driver dead, 13 students and two teachers injured. This is after suspected bandits raided three busses belonging to Tot day school, Kerio Valley and Mogil secondary schools and indiscriminately shot at occupants. The February 17 incident happened between Arror and Tot in Elgeiyo Marakwet when the students were on their way back to school from a field trip. FIDA has faulted the government for failing to provide security to Kerio Valley residents even as they called for action. “The bandit targeting school children shows how callous and inhumane these acts are. This is unacceptable and the government must move with speed to halt the ever-deteriorating and unending security situation in Kerio Valley,” said FIDA. FIDA has been active in recognizing the effects of conflict and violence against women and children. They have also offered psychosocial support and legal assistance to the women, widows and girls affected by conflicts and violence. The organization has been at the forefront in pushing for peacebuilding at Kerio Valley. “During our visits to Kerio Valley, we have received and documented witness and survivors accounts of children coming under direct attack in schools and in their homes,” said FIDA. FIDA said the government has a constitutional obligation to guarantee Kenyans of their security. "It is citizens right not to be subjected to any form of violence from either public or private sources, to torture in any manner, whether physical or psychological, to corporal punishment, punished in a cruel, inhuman or degrading manner,” added FIDA. They called upon President Uhuru Kenyatta to ensure an end to the conflict. FIDA at the same time cautioned politicians to exercise sobriety and tone down on divisive remarks during the electioneering period.
