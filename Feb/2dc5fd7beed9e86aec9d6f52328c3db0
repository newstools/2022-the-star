World Championships 5,000m silver medalist Margaret Chelimo believes she has what it takes to succeed two-time Olympic silver medalist Hellen Obiri in the 10,000m race. Obiri has since revealed her intentions to upgrade to road races and marathons. Speaking during the Memorial Agnes Tirop World Cross Country tour in Eldoret on Friday, Chelimo conceded that it would be an uphill task to step into Obiri's shoes. “It will be a huge challenge to plug the gap in 10,000m but I feel I can work hard and fill Obiri's shoes. It will not be easy since Tirop is also gone but I feel I am ready for another challenge,” said Chelimo, adding that shifting to 10,000m would give her an opportunity to further her career. “I have been running 5,000m and after competing at the national championships last year, I realised I have the power to run well. Apart from that, it is also part of my career progression and giving myself another opportunity,” Chelimo said. “After getting a medal at the 2019 World Championships in 5,000m as well as at Africa and Commonwealth Games, I saw the need to change. In life, you have to graduate slowly and this is part of my graduation into the new challenge." Achieving that, she said, would require her to adjust to a new training program. “As the most senior athlete in the 5,000m, I need to train harder and be more focused. I want to do well and this is just like losing weight, you can’t do it within a day but with discipline and dedication, the body changes every year,” she said. Meanwhile, 2018 World Under 20 5,000m champion Edward Zakayo has revealed he is ready to make up for lost time after a back injury he sustained earlier kept him out of action for two years. Zakayo said he would mainly focus on this year's World Championships in Eugene, Oregon and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. “I have been watching 5,000m races and the last time we won gold was in 2005. I believe this will be our year,” said Zakayo.
