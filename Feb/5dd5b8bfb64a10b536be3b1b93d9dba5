Over the weekend, Faustina Charles Mfinaga, alias Nandy, tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend William Lyimo, alias Billnass. The traditional wedding took place at Nandy's hometown, Mlandizi. It is reported that the rapper paid TSh10 million (Sh491,356) for the singer's dowry. Nandy gave reasons why she opted for a traditional wedding. "Billnass had given me a ring but we were sat down and told how the traditions are and that is why we decided to do it right," she told Bona TV. In the past, the couple had parted ways but decided to rekindle their love. "We broke up for a year plus. We kept in touch so it was easy for us to get back together." The 'Kivuruge' hitmaker hopes to have a white wedding by June. "The family said the wedding should not go beyond the sixth month, but we have not settled on a date yet." The singer's mother added, "I am so happy. We have waited for this day for so long. We pray that they get to tie the knot in a white wedding, too." Nandy took to social media to promise her lover that she would never let him down. Billnass first proposed to Nandy in 2020 and did it again over the weekend.
