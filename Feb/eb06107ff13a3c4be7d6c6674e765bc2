Deputy President William Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza alliance principals Moses Wetangula and Musalia Mudavadi were on Saturday crowned as elders by the Kwale county Kaya council of elders. The three were given Mijikenda's most respected names illustrating acceptance and togetherness. Ruto was nicknamed Bilashaka, a digo name that means ‘no doubt’. The Kaya elders have used the name to show confidence in his leadership. Mudavadi was given Mwamgunga, who was once believed to be a prominent leader of the Mijikenda people, according to the elders. Wetangula was given Mbodze Mbodze, who according to the locals Mbodze and Matsedzi were the ancestors of the Mijikenda communities. They are believed to be the first people who gave birth to the Mijikenda people, however, some prefer the name to a tree whose leaves fold when touched. The coronation was done by the highly respected Kaya council of elders. Later on, the elders recited some prayers seeking powers from the ancestors to protect them from any form of harm. The three were dressed in the Kaya traditional attire before being given their new names. They wore a red hat that had a free black tail hanging on the sideways and covered with black pieces of clothes on the lower side. The elders had also put on red hats, black wrap and some other blue, white and red wraps that were worn across their upper bodies. The Kaya elders could be heard telling the three that they should not worry even as they assured the three of their win during August 9. “There should be no problem, you will emerge victorious in the coming polls because you have the support of the ancestors,” one of the elders said. Ruto, Musalia and Mudavadi were seen smiling as a sign that they have accepted the new names. They were later allowed to address the locals and sell their manifestos after taking an oath that they will work together with the Mijikenda people and Kwale community. Edited by B. Marita
