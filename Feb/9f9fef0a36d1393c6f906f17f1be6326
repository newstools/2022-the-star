Lakers coach Austin Tuju has warned forward Alice Owiti over complacency despite being named the Most Valuable Player in the Mulembe Hockey Tournament over the weekend in Kakamega. Awiti was part of the Kenya team to the African Cup of Nations as the Jacqueline Mwangi-coached side managed a bronze in the bi-annual tournament in  Ghana last month. The tactician said it is important for her to focus especially at this developmental stage as she is yet to reach the peak. "We saw her ability over the weekend. Alice has endurance but I don't want success to get into her head because she will become comfortable. "She is on the right track but she needs to remain humble and eliminate errors in her game for her to succeed," Tuju said. At the same time, the tactician hinted that the lakeside club will soon embark on a massive youth recruitment for long-term development. "Youth development is critical and we will pay attention to age between 10-17 years." "We must embrace continuity. We have seen other clubs struggling simply because they didn't have Plan B. If we don't plan now, the future will be difficult," he noted. Tuju thinks the time is ripe for the Lakers to target the Premier League title despite the challenges affecting the self-sponsored club. Lakers finished fourth in their debut in the top tier in 2019. "We have no sponsor and our resources are already overstretched but that has not affected our performance. We continue engaging the county government of Kisumu to help us acquire a training ground," Tuju remarked. He added, "We are not polished up yet but we have high chances of picking the league title."
