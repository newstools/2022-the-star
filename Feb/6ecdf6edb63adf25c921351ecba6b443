National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has again told off the ODM leader Raila over the Azimio la Umoja Movement. Muturi said that the slogan that will be used by Raila for his presidential bid was first used by his father Mzee Jaramogi Oginga Odinga in 1964 “We need to focus on our future. We will not allow anyone to take us back to where we came from. Azimio was Mzee Jaramogi Oginga Odinga's campaign tune in 1964. Hiyo sasa ndo tunashinda tukiimbiwa surely (that’s what we are being told? Surely)?” Muturi said. He said that the political parties should be allowed to spread their gospel, adding that grassroots community organisations and leaders have the passion to guide development occurring in their communities. The speaker made his remarks on Saturday when he visited Nanyuki-Laikipia County to engage with the residents. Muturi has said that he will be on the ballot on August 9 seeking to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta using the Democratic Party. He also cautioned political parties at this moment when they are forming coalitions ahead of August polls, saying that they might end up being deceived. Recently, Muturi also criticized Raila for claiming that he was behind the construction of the Thika Highway. Muturi has been endorsed by the Democratic party as its flag bearer. Joseph Munyao who was party leader stepped down for Muturi and was named as the patron of the outfit. Munyao termed Muturi as an energetic leader who holds the vision of the country at heart and is ready to change its politics. Addressing the delegates at Bomas of Kenya, Justin Muturi said he is not ready to join hands with any of the coalitions in the country. He condemned them for advocating on the politics of hatred saying it might plunge the country into violence if leaders fail to change the tactics.
