The silly season of politicking is with us. It is the season where neighbours turn enemies and friends’ block each other on social media platforms based on political affiliation or who they are seen to be supporting. Politicians have taken to a habit of inciting people against each other. Rally after rally, we are subjected to disgrace by big names who either insult each other or demean rivals. In the past two weeks, we have been swamped by a war of words between President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto. These are people who hold the highest office and as the Bible says, to whom much is given much is required. Both have a duty to behave well and conduct an issue-based campaign. It is important for ordinary folk to learn that it is futile and foolish to fight a fellow citizen over politics. Kenyans need to realise the elections will be over and the neighbour he or she fought will still be his neighbour and most likely the only one to come to their aid in times of need. It is high time Kenyans matured and engaged in politics without engaging in violence. Remember Kenya will still be here, as an individual you have a responsibility of handing over a peaceful nation to your generations. The police, too, need to issue stern warning and arrest politicians who incite Kenyans. It is promising that the police  will record hate speech in rallies but it shouldn’t stop at that. Action needs to be taken against hate-spewing politicians.
