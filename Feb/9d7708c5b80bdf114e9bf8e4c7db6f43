Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju has claimed DP William Ruto is unfit for leadership on a day President Uhuru Kenyatta is meeting party's lawmakers at State House. Tuju said Ruto's character is not presidential and urged Kenyans not to gamble with the future of the country by electing him in the August 9 General Election. "Character matters a lot, you must look at someone's character," Tuju said. He claimed the second in command plotted to sabotage Uhuru's administration and make the country ungovernable. To execute his plans, Tuju said that the second in command approached ODM leader Raila Odinga long before the 2018 handshake to join forces and defeat Uhuru's agenda in Parliament. "He was the first person to approach Raila so that they blackmail the President," Tuju said. According to the CS without portfolio, the President got wind of the DP's moves and averted the plans. The Jubilee SG was speaking on Friday during a morning show on Inooro FM, a vernacular radio station broadcasting in the Kikuyu language. The SG also said Ruto has been working to weaken the ruling outfit after losing the grip of the Party. He said Ruto is also bent on weakening the party to ensure Mt. Kenya do not have a voice in the political discourse. In January, Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe also claimed Uhuru ended his dalliance with Ruto because the DP was out to sabotage his administration. Speaking in Thika, Murathe said that Ruto was given half the government including some of the most powerful ministries but the President was not satisfied with the way they were being run. But Ruto's spokesperson, Emmanuel Talam who spoke to the Star questioned why all these claims were not made before the 2017 elections. Edited by Mercy Asamba
