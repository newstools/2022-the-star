A farewell dinner was on Friday held for former Regional Commissioner George Natembeya at the Sarova Woodland hotel in Nakuru. Natembeya quit civil service to focus on his Trans Nzoia county governor seat. Present were the Nakuru County Governor Lee Kinyanjui and  Nakuru County Commissioner Erastus Mbui. County commissioners and other security officials were also present. "I would like to appreciate him for his selfless service to the public for the time I have known him. During his term as RC, we did not have an escalation of conflict in our County which was witnessed in the past." Lee Kinyanjui said in a post. After the cake cutting ceremony, the attendees interacted and got to enjoy live music as they interacted. "Your current position is an interview for your next big thing. Discharge it with utmost commitment and dedication," Kinyanjui added in his speech.
