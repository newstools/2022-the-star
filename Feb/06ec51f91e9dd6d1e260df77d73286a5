Kenya Power on Monday began disconnecting illegal electricity connections in households in Nyamira county. The area managing director Daniel Ariri led  KPLC technicians and police officers in the joint operations. The team disconnected power in three homesteads in Gesima ward, Kitutu Masaba constituency and vowed to continue with the crackdown until sanity is restored in the sector. In the first homestead, the worn out electricity pole that had been erected recently was brought down since it was putting at risk the lives of residents. In the second homestead, live electric wires were hanging dangerously with some insulated with polythene. “We are losing millions through illegal power connections like these ones and we are not going to relax until we have eradicated this vice" "It is very dangerous that even the people doing the connections are not professionals putting the lives of many at risk,” said Ariri. During the crackdown, police arrested two suspects who will help them with further investigations on illegal connections . The suspects are held at Keroka police station. The exercise comes a day after a 50-year-old man was burnt beyond recognition inside his house after an electric fault that is suspected have resulted from an illegal power connection. Residents of the area said they are not aware the connection was illegal since the people who did it claimed to work for the Kenya Power Company. “If someone comes and says he has been contracted to connect power , we don't object since we believe he is genuine,” Janet Kwamboka told journalists.
