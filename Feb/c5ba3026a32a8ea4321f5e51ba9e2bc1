The ODM delegates at Kasarani gymnasium have approved a proposal to have the party join the Azimio La Umoja coalition. This means that the delegates have endorsed a plan by ODM to work with other Parties within the Azimio La Umoja to form the next government. The proposal had on Friday been approved by the National Governing Council and was read to the delegates' national chairman John Mbadi. The delegates have also approved ODM leader Raila Odinga as the party presidential candidate. Raila's name will be recommended to the Azimio coalition for further engagement as the alliance's presidential candidate in the August 9, general election. " I do here present the Right honourable Raila Odinga as the ODM party presidential candidate for the 2022 general election," said ODM elections board chairperson Catherine Muma. Because Raila was the only candidate presented to the NDC, delegates voted by acclamation to formally hand him the mantle to fly the ODM flag. Kakamega governor Wycliffe Oparanya, who on Friday withdrew his bid for an ODM ticket, proposed Raila as the sole candidate for the party in the Azimio coalition. Mombasa governor Hassan Joho, who also on Friday pulled out his bid, seconded the proposal to have Raila as the ODM flag bearer to Azimio
