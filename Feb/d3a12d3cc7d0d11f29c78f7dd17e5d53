The construction of the much-awaited Sh20 billion Shimoni Port facility is set to kick- off in April, officials have said. The pioneer fishing harbour project will cost around Sh2.6 billion at least for the first phase. Speaking on Friday, the Kenya Ports Authority Acting Managing Director John Mwangemi said they have finaliSed the process of land transfer and the contractor will at any time commence construction works. "We are happy to announce that we have completed the exercise of land acquisition which will enable us to start the project," he said. The construction of the port had previously delayed due to geographical issues. The fish port will comprise of cold storage facilities, a fish processing plant and conventional cargo handling equipment that will facilitate fish value addition and commercial trade. Other components of the port include a new fish landing jetty and a fish market to improve fishing activities and standards of living for the local fishermen. The land that was earlier allocated for the project turned out to be unfavorable for port activities. The government later settled on land owned by the State Department of Fisheries that is next to the old Shimoni fish landing Jetty. Initially, phase one of the project was scheduled to begin in July 2021. Mwangemi said proper mechanisms have been outlined to fast-track the implementation of the project. He said the port will at least take two years to be completed. "The project is expected to be ready within the next 24 months immediately after its commencement," he said. According to Mwangemi, the old jetty will also be rehabilitated to ease smooth port operations and to allow locals to continue using it for socioeconomic benefits. KPA will also take the initiative of refurbishing the current offices and installment of complex water and electricity systems that are key components in the management of the port operations.
