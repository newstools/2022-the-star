The Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission has announced that continuous voter registration(CVR) will continue in constituencies and Huduma centres across the country. The commission directed all registration officers in the 290 constituencies to proceed with the exercise after the end of Phase 2 of the Enhanced Continuous Voter Registration. IEBC had missed its target by a big margin as the voter registration ended on Sunday. According to IEBC, the second phase realized a total of 1,031,645 new voters out of 4.5 million voters target. A total of 396,163 registered voters applied to transfer to registration centers of their choice, while 2,269 changed their particulars. The commission has attributed the low turnout of voters registration to voter apathy and delays in the issuance of identity cards. The registration officers will deploy 3 BVR kits per constituency and 1 kit shall be stationed in all the Huduma Centers countrywide. “This will avail opportunities to eligible citizens, especially those who will have acquired identity cards after the closure of ECVR phase 2, to register as voters,” IEBC said in a press release. The commission calls upon eligible Kenyans to continue registering as voters to exercise their civic rights as enhanced in the Constitution of Kenya.
