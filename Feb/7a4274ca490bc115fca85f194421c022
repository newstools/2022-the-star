Activist Boniface Mwangi risks being jailed for contempt of court after failing to show cause why he did not appear for the defamation case against him by Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua. Justice George Odunga issued summons for the second time where Mwangi is expected to appear in person. The court will give the ruling on  February 22, 2022. The activist had been ordered been to appear in court in person to show cause why he should not be jailed for disobeying court orders. Governor Mutua filed contempt of court proceedings seeking to cite Mwangi for contempt over his continuous behaviour of disobeying court orders. Through lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui, Mutua wants the activist to show cause why he should not be held for contempt of court for having expressly breached and acted in violation of court order prohibiting him from publishing in the print, electronic or online media defamatory material or concerning Governor Mutua. “Mwangi disobeyed the order on 6th and 9th January 2022 by publishing on his Twitter account content against Governor Mutua,” Kinyajui said. His lawyer was virtually present yet the law demands that contempt of court proceedings be physical.
