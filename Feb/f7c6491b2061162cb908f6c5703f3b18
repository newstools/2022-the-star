Former Garissa Women Rep Shukran Gure on Wednesday urged residents to vote her back promising to pick up from where she left on development. Gure spoke in Dadaab subcounty when she officially announced her candidature after elders' endorsement. She regretted that not much has been done to empower the women,  youths and people living with disabilities. The former Woman Rep contested on a Wiper Party ticket in 2017 but narrowly lost to Anab Gure of Jubilee party. The county is home to three major clans namely Awdhaq, Samawadhal and the Awlihan. Shukran hails from the later. “I want to sincerely thank the elders for picking me. I accept this endorsement with gratitude and my obligation is to provide good leadership to our community and the people of Garissa," she said. "I  am more determined to deliver better results compared to when I was first elected." Gure also took issue with those seeking to divide the community saying the process of picking a candidate to face aspirants from other clans was free and fair. She said all women aspirants were asked to present their applications, interviews were conducted and aspirants gave their consent vowing to abide by the verdict of the elders. She hit out at a ‘few well known individuals whom she accused of  coming  in to the fray at the last hour with the sole aim of distorting the process for their personal interest. “I would like to thank the entire Sagale's family, youth and women leaders and elders for their unwavering support for women leadership," Gure said. "The process of picking the family flag bearer for the Woman Rep seat was very tedious but well thought". She added “Unfortunately we have others who want to split our votes to the advantage of our competitors. I want to appeal to our people not to fall for that tricks". She urged her supporters to back any leader has a solid agenda for women and youth and champions for their course without fear or favour.
