Molo MP Kuria Kimani has joined the United Democratic Alliance party led by Deputy President William Ruto. The MP was welcomed to the UDA party by Ruto at his official Karen residence. The MP was elected for his first term in office on a Jubilee ticket. He will be seeking the UDA ticket in the primaries. "I have served my Jubilee Party diligently. As I look forward to serving the people of Molo as their Member of Parliament for another term, I will be seeking this mandate through United Democratic Alliance (UDA)," he stated on his Twitter handle. Other leaders present during his welcoming include Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua and his Kiharu counterpart Ndindi Nyoro. "Karibu to UDA - Kazi ni Kazi Molo MP, Hon Kuria Kimani (KK). The Hustler Nation received Hon CPA KK Sunday Morning. Karibu sana Bro," MP Nyoro stated on Facebook. Kimani has been leaning towards the Handshake team before he went under for some time. He was perhaps contemplating his political future leading to his decision to join the DP's camp.
