Kenya Premier League side Nairobi City Stars have concluded their mid-season transfer business after signing midfielder Augustine Kuta. Kuta, the second and final addition in the mid transfer window, was signed from Kibera Black Stars on a short-term deal to the end of the season. Kuta was handed a warm welcome by team coordinator, Samson Otieno. He said they identified Kuta during preseason-friendly games against Nation FC and KEFWA. “But with a full squad, and in a bid to keep him close, the best we could do was recommend him to join Kibera BlackStars with whom we share a training ground. His chance to join us is here and we welcome him to Simba Wa Nairobi,” added Samson Head coach Nicholas Muyoti said: “We have been tracking him in the last few months and I have no doubt he will bring the much-needed punch as we head into the tougher and last half of the season.” On his part, Kuta, a Business Management (Finance and Accounting) graduate from Moi University, said; “It’s a great honour to join Nairobi City Stars. I have always rated the club highly and I can’t wait to get down to work with my new teammates.” Kuta, whose last Premier League work station was at Western Stima back in 2020, bid Kibera Black Stars goodbye on Saturday during a league game against Silibwet Leons. He will don jersey no. 29 which was recently vacated by striker Ebrima Sanneh. Kuta got injured in October 2019 when he tore a meniscus on the right knee and was out of action for a whole year. On Friday, City Stars signed budding attacking midfielder Mohammed Bajaber aka Hamudi, 18, on loan from Star Field Academy.
