The Embassy of Finland has rolled out a Sh774 million three-year gender based violence programme in three counties. The counties include Bungoma, Samburu and Kilifi. Georginah Gichohi, a programme coordinator at the embassy, said  Finland has advanced Sh645,000 million grant, while the government of Kenya has given Sh129,000 million towards the programme. Gichohi said the programme is being implemented by the Ministry of Gender. "The three counties made it to the programme after serious considerations on poverty levels, cultural norms, marginalisation and political goodwill." She spoke in Kisumu after a roundtable discussion organised by Transparency International between civil societies and the Embassy of Finland. Gichohi said the programme will build on existing interventions. "Much focus will be on training the duty bearers on how to deal with cases of GBV," she said. Gichohi said harmful cultural practices against either gender will be put into consideration to help in developing a preventive and responsive programme. Deputy Head of Mission at the embassy, Otto Stenius, announced a number of collaborations between his government and the Kenyan government. Stenius said they have programmes targeting persons with disabilities, women, academic cooperation and support for TI in matters of governance and public finance management.
