A Nairobi court on Friday fined five foreigners Sh400,000 each, or in default to serve a one-year jail term, for the offence of engaging in business activity without being authorised by a work permit. The five foreigners were arrested by a multi-agency team comprising DCI and Immigration Services at a construction company in Nairobi county. The National Police Service said the five convicts will be repatriated after completion of their jail term or payment of the fine. Members of the public have been lauded by the police for continuously sharing information with them. Also, the police have said that as they appreciate and welcome foreigners, they will not hesitate to crack the whip on anyone found contravening the law. Last month, a multi-agency team comprising police and immigration department officers arrested six Chinese nationals who were working in the country without permits. The police said six; four females and two males were nabbed in the Imara Daima area, Nairobi. Police have cautioned employers that it is illegal for any foreigner to work in Kenya without a valid work permit. In 2018, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said that foreigners should apply for work permits from their home countries before seeking work in Kenya. The CS also warned that Kenya will not issue work permits to foreigners for jobs that can be done by Kenyans.
