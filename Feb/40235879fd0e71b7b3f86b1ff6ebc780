Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko is expected to announce the candidate that he will be supporting for the Nairobi governor seat in the August 9 polls. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Sonko dismissed claims that he had already endorsed a candidate for that seat. "I would like to distance myself from such malicious, rumors and false information," Sonko said. "I urge my supporters to overlook such kind of fake news as you wait for a major announcement that I'll be making soon." Sonko said the Nairobians have their votes at hand and don't need a leader to be chosen for them. He says that those eyeing for various seats should hunt for votes based on their manifestos, track record and vision for the Nairobi people. Candidates who have expressed interest in the seat include Governor Anne Kananu, Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru, businessman Richard Ngatia, and businesswoman Agnes Kagure. The battle for the capital is shaping up as the most fiercely contested gubernatorial election since the introduction of devolved units. The Jubilee party which has been in power since 2017, was not happy with how its then candidate former governor Sonko had run Nairobi for three years. This lead to the the handing over of functions to the national government, followed by formation of President Uhuru Kenyatta's brainchild Nairobi Metropolitan Services. NMS is still in charge of the capital's core functions despite Nairobi having a substantive governor who rose to power last November. The fight for Nairobi revolves around control of lucrative contracts and business interests of political elites who control the city.
