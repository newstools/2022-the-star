The Orange Democratic Movement and Jubilee parties will have joint nominations ahead of August 9 general elections. ODM party director of elections Junet Mohamed and Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju speaking separately in Migori county said the coalition will be under Azimio. Speaking in Migori town on Sunday, Junet said the deal will come in after Azimio la Umoja coalition is completely ratified. “We will conduct joint party primaries under Azimio coalition because we are partners, it will also go towards managing the business of the country jointly,” Junet said. He said the move will be cemented under ratified coalition as the cordial relationship between the two parties will be extended into long term political agreements to strengthen both parties . He said they are sure of forming the next government. Speaking a week ago at Sony Guest house during voters registration drive, Tuju said a committee formed from both parties is working on how to carry joint nominations. “We will champion for a common course, we are in the final stages of finalising the coalition talks,” he said. He said the nomination drive will be finalised and done under consensus. “In some areas we will leave nomination for one party, in others we will have candidates under Azimio so that we can not only win the presidency but also have the numbers in legislative houses,” he said.
