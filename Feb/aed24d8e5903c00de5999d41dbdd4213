Nairobi City Stars have been boosted following the return of striker  Nicholas Kipkirui to full training after recovering from a recent injury suffered during a 1-0 loss against AFC Leopards last month at Nyayo Stadium. Kipkirui limped off the Leopards' game with four minutes of regulation time left, handing John Kamau playtime to see off the game. According to team physio Brian Odongo Otieno, Kipkirui is now fully fit and ready for selection for the upcoming matches. “Kipkirui suffered an ankle ligament sprain against AFC Leopards at  Nyayo. He is now fully fit and has resumed full training,” said Odongo Due to his injury, Kipkirui missed four games against FC Talanta and Tusker, which they won, and away and home games against league leaders Kakamega Homeboyz, which ended in draws. From nine games played so far this season, Kipkirui has scored once and provided four assists. At the same time, National Super League side Shabana have suffered a major blow following the departure of highly-rated attacking midfielder Brian Michira. Team manager Onchomba Sani said Michira is in the process of signing for Kenya Premier League side, Wazito. “He is currently training with Wazito,” said Sani. He said the team’s management will seek to sign at least six experienced players in the current transfer window. “We have already signed three players including a goalkeeper, defender, and midfielder. Following the imminent departure of Michira, we must get a quality replacement,” Sani said.
