A woman who killed her son, 9,  by beating him to death for eating food meant for his siblings has been sentenced to four years in jail. High Court Judge Kanyi Kimondo on February 10 convicted Grace Njeri Kanyuru for killing her son in 2019 after she pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter. "Sentence should be commensurate to the moral blameworthiness of the offender but also guided by the nature and gravity of crime. I sentence the accused to four years imprisonment," Justice Kimondo ruled. The judge said the sentence should run from 27th December 2019, the date when she was first arrested and placed in custody. The court heard that the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of manslaughter under a plea agreement recorded on 8 February last year. The prosecution said the offence was grave and attracted a sentence of life imprisonment. The court noted that the facts were truly tragic. The court heard on 27 December 2019, that the accused beat up her son mercilessly and eft him for dead outside a tea-buying centre in Ngorogocho. The autopsy report showed that the minor died from head injury as a result of blunt force trauma. "I have paid heed to the mitigation tendered by the accused. The accused is aged 40 and has three other children. She was a first time offender and regrets her conduct," the court was told. Justice Kimondo however stated that even though the accused was remorseful, the life of an innocent child was lost.
