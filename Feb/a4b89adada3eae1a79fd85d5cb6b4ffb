Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has expressed his support for Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja movement saying they share common beliefs. While speaking during an interview on Citizen Tv, Mutua said he would vote for Raila Odinga, if he fails to be on the ballot as a presidential candidate on the August 9, polls. "I'm going to run for the presidency. But If anything happens and I'm unable to run, for whatever reason and I'm still able to vote, I'll vote for Raila. Because I know what he stands for," Mutua said in the interview on Thursday. However, Mutua said he is also open to the possibility of Raila backing him for the country's top seat. "For now, I hope that Raila will get to a point where he says 'I think Mutua is better, he is a younger version of me who can win and has the energy to work'," Mutua said. The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader labelled Raila as a reasonable man who believes in democracy. "He is a man who gives opportunities to people to compete to win. I've seen it," he said. When asked why he can't just join Azimio, Mutua said, "Azimio is a coalition, not a person. It's a movement of an ideology." He further said, "We are not joining because of a person. It's about a movement for what we stand for. Leadership can change. It's what you believe in that matters. Don't put your hopes on an individual."
