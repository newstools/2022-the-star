Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has hinted at ditching Deputy President William Ruto for ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kabeabea said he will shift to ODM if Raila picks Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya as his deputy. Kabeabea said he would rather lose while campaigning for a Raila-Munya ticket than being in Ruto’s camp. Last week Munya shelved his Meru gubernatorial ambitions to serve President Uhuru Kenyatta's Cabinet. The MP spoke yesterday when he inspected the construction of the Mikinduri-Kunati-Gacibine road and launched developments projects at Kaathi and Kiguma primary schools. He said Munya has the potential to even become the president of Kenya. Kabeabea is the only MP elected on Munya’s PNU party and an ardent supporter of DP Ruto. In 2018, Ruto gifted Kabeabea one of his escort vehicles cementing their long time relationship. Kabeabea said though Ruto has promised him the position of chairman of the Transport committee in parliament, Munya is a brother, he cannot afford to betray.
