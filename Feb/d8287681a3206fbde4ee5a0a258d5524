Diamond's baby mama Zari Hassan has of late been spending quality time with GK Choppa, a fellow Ugandan based in South Africa, too. Photos and videos of the two getting cosy have gone viral. While some of Zari's fans believe the two are just friends working on a project, others maintain the two are an item. In a video shared by the two, Zari and Choppa looked happy together, and at some point, he caressed her thighs. In recent photos, the couple is seen out shopping. All this time, they are noticeably surrounded by bodyguards. The couple can be seen posing for photos, while GK is gripping Zari's derriere.
