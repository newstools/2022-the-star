President Uhuru Kenyatta's aggressive performance on the political stage could upset his deputy William Ruto's strategy and potentially dismantle Kenya Kwanza's political arithmetic. Uhuru on Wednesday began mobilising his Mt Kenya political backyard to support ODM leader Raila Odinga and openly linked Ruto to mega corruption, saying he is not fit to lead. Ruto responded by simply saying he accepts the President's decision to endorse Raila. “I respect the decision of the President to say he supports the person who has never voted for him, who has never supported him. There is no problem. Let us relax now," Ruto said in Kitui on Thursday.
