Ukrainian authorities have announced that their delegation has arrived at the Ukraine-Belarus border to start peace talks with the Russian delegation. The main issue on their agenda, they say, is a ceasefire and withdrawal of troops from the Ukrainian territory. Earlier it was reported that the talks kept being postponed due to logistical and safety issues. In his address on Sunday, Ukrainian President Zelensky said that he didn’t expect a breakthrough from these talks. But, he added, they should try and use this chance even if it is small, so that no-one can blame Ukraine for not trying to stop the war.
