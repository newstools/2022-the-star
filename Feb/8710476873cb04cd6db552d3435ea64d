Four matches in the Kenya Women's Premier League earlier set for this weekend have been postponed indefinitely to allow national team players more time to prepare for the African Women's Cup of Nations qualifier against Uganda. Thika Queens' match against hosts Trans Nzoia Falcons, which was expected to be the highlight of this weekend, is among those shelved. The changes also affect Bunyore's duel against Gaspo as well as the Kisumu All-Starlets match versus Ulinzi Starlets. Former champions and current league leaders Vihiga Queens' match against Kangemi Ladies match has also been put off. However, match involving Kayole Starlets and Nakuru City Queens will go on as planned as well as the encounter between Wadadia and Zetech Sparks. "The national team Harambee Starlets are in a residential training camp preparing for the AWCON qualifiers against Crested Cranes of Uganda. "The technical bench would like to have more time with the players to prepare adequately for the monumental assignment," a statement from the FKF  Caretaker Committee read. The technical bench committee advised that the players in camp be exempted from club duties until the return leg against Uganda. "If a club has more than two players in the national team, the fixtures involving such a club, may upon the request by the club, be called off," the statement noted Vihiga Queens have seven players in the Starlets' camp while Gaspo and Thika have five each. Starlets have their fingers crossed that the Confederation of African Football will rescind their earlier decision to lock the team out.
