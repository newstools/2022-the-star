The state has opened more Covid–19 vaccination centres in malls, apartments and chiefs and assistant chiefs’ offices in Athi River, Machakos county. Athi River deputy county commissioner Charles Wambugu said Gateway Mall and Great Wall Gardens Apartments located along Nairobi – Mombasa highway in Syokimau and Athi River respectively had been considered as new Covid–19 vaccination centres. Wambugu said they had also extended the vaccination time to run from 7am to 5pm, daily. The administrator spoke to the press after a consultative meeting at his office in Athi River on Thursday. Present were the four assistant county commissioners Dennis Onganga (Mlolongo), Asha Omar (Daystar), Edward Wasike (Lukenya) and Abdi Mohammed (Mavoko), together with divisional security committees and other stakeholders. He said the vaccination exercise was progressing well in the subcounty. “We discussed the vaccination issue with our MoH and agreed that we continue extending timelines for the exercise,” Wambugu said. He said most families living at Great Wall Gardens Apartments were not available during working hours due to their busy work schedules. “We are going to have the exercise between 7am and 5pm in those areas. We have also agreed with the MoH that we begin having immunisations at assistant chiefs and chiefs’ offices,” the administrator said. “I also urge the people who have gotten their second jab, to go for the booster dose in any assistant chief and chief offices from Kyumvi junction to Joska between 7am and 5pm,” he added. Wambugu said those who had received first jabs should go for the second jab. “It’s for your own good and that of your loved ones and family members alongside those people you interact with during the day,” he said.
