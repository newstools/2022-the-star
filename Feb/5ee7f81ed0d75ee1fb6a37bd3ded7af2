ODM leader Raila Odinga has said they will work with President Uhuru Kenyatta when he is elected president in the August polls. Speaking during the National Governing Convention (NDC) on Friday, the former prime minister said the August 9 General Election would only strengthen the Uhuru-Raila bond. He said ODM and Jubilee came together to unite Kenyans and ensure development, and this was not going to stop after the August polls. "When we take over, we will continue with the work he has started and move on. This bond will not die with the elections. The elections are just going to strengthen it and we will work together moving forward," he said. The former prime minister said as the two parties, ODM and Jubilee come together to form Azimio la Umoja coalition, and would therefore work together as a team moving forward. He thanked the ODM members for nominating him as the ODM presidential candidate, saying at first he was reluctant to join the race. "I was reluctant to contest for the presidency for the fifth time. I had to ask the people of Kenya if I should contest, and after getting the nod, on Dec 10, I responded to the request." During the conference, ODM deputy party leaders Wycliffe Oparanya and Hassan Joho officially dropped their presidential ambitions and endorsed party leader Raila Odinga. Oparanya said Raila was more experienced and thus the best candidate to fly the party's flag. "I do hereby propose that Raila be our next candidate in the August elections. We are giving him all the powers to go out there and negotiate with other leaders to ensure he becomes the 5th president."
