Ahead of the August Elections, leaders are seeking to consolidate their vote blocks as campaigns heat up around Kenya. ODM party leader Raila Odinga who has had a strong support base in Western is expected to be in a charm offensive against the union between Deputy President William Ruto and ANC boss Musalia Mudavadi. Raila and the Western Kenya leaders are setting the stage for a major retaliation battle in Western Kenya. Expect fire, vengeance and recriminations. The leaders pledged to 'bury' Musalia and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangu'la for what they called political suicide of “mortgaging” the Luhya community to Ruto without their consent.
