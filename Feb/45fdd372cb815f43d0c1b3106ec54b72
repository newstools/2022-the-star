ODM Party leader Raila Odinga on Saturday evening met India Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi expressed his happiness at being able to meet Raila after almost three and half years. In a statement on Sunday, the PM recollected his multiple interactions with Raila since 2008 in both India and Kenya, as well as the latter’s support to the Vibrant Gujarat Summit in 2009 and 2012. The two leaders also discussed other issues of mutual interest. Raila who is in India for a private visit, expressed his commitment to further strengthening India-Kenya relations. Prime Minister Modi also conveyed his best wishes to Raila for his good health and future. Raila accompanied his daughter Rosemary for eye treatment at a hospital in India. Rosemary suffered a minor stroke, leading to her hospitalisation in South Africa in February 2017. The stroke affected her eyesight and forced her to withdraw from the Kibra parliamentary race. The former prime minister had a grand reception when he landed in Kochi, Southwest India, on Monday. According to the Indian Express, the family first took her to South Africa, Israel and China before finally seeking treatment at Sreedhareeyam Ayurvedic Eye Hospital in India.
