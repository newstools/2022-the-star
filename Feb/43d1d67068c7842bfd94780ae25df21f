The national government has been urged to help end widespread human-wildlife conflict in the Kerio Valley. Moses Lelmo, an aspirant for the Keiyo North parliamentary seat in Elgeyo Marakwet county, deplored the massive destruction of food and cash crops by rampaging elephants. The drought has caused many animals to leave their parks and reserves and seek water and food in human settlements. He said the invasion by elephants and other wild animals into human settlements was decimating  crops and endangering residents. Th Kenya Wildlife Service should ensure the elephants are driven back to their sanctuary, he said. Lelmo said the national government should call a stakeholders meeting, including KWS,  counties, affected communities and seek a lasting solution. Residents live near the Rimoi National Game Reserve, he said. Lelmo urged the KWS to swiftly instal a strong fence, to separate human settlements from the national game reserve. “When you graze your animals inside the game reserve, it displaces hundreds of the jumbos from their sanctuary and that creates conflict between residents and jumbos,” he said. A senior KWS official in Iten town, who declined to be named, said they have already arrested some of the issues that have been the main cause of human-wildlife conflicts. “There is no cause for alarm among the residents living along the Kerio Valley because all security measures have been taken to secure their lives and their property,” he said.
