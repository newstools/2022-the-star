The Kakamega-based Invest and Grow Sacco has declared a dividend of Sh844 million at 17 per cent in 2021 despite the impacts of Covid-19. In 2020, the sacco declared a dividend of Sh746 million at the rate of 15 per cent. Sacco chairman Kennedy Keya said the dividend increase in 2021 was due to the continued contribution of monthly deposits by members. The dividend was disbursed to more than 40,000 members, with every member earning based on his or her deposited amount. Keya said they are impressed by the increase in dividends to members compared to last year. He said sacco assets grew by 12 per cent in 2021 compared to 10 per cent in 2020, translating to Sh11.7 billion from Sh 10.5 billion. Keya, who is also the chairman of Kenya Teachers Sacco Association, said the income increased by 18 per cent in 2021 as compared to 0.2 per cent in 2020. This is from Sh 1.406 billion to Sh1.658 billion. “The increase in income is attributed to the opening up of the economy from Covid-19 pandemic effects as well as diversification,” Keya said. The share capital improved by 20 per cent in 2021, translating to Sh890 million from Sh 742 million in 2020. Keya attributed the share capital improvement to the annual increment of share capital by Sh4, 000 per member as per the strategic plan. The chairman spoke during the 44th annual delegates meeting held in Kisumu on Friday. Further, the non-withdrawal deposits increased by nine per cent in 2021 up from seven per cent in 2020, translating to Sh 5.4 billion from Sh5.1 billion due to the consistent contribution of deposits by members. “We have also continued to disburse loans to all our members promptly, which saw the credit disbursed in 2021 increase by nine per cent (Sh536 million) to Sh 6.4 billion from Sh 5.8 billion,” Keya said. This means the sacco disbursed Sh3 billion loans towards investment and Sh3.2 billion for income in 2021 with Sh 2.7 billion for investment and Sh 3 billion on income in 2020. The sacco has witnessed improvement in membership recruitment  despite the Covid-19 pandemic. “We still observe there are so many potential members we have not recruited,” Keya said. The sacco targets recruiting at least 2, 4000 members annually. Last year, it recruited 1,575 members as compared to 834 members in 2020. Within the same period, 402 members voluntarily withdrew from the sacco compared to 332 members in 2020. The sacco equally lost 177 members through death in 2021 compared to 126 members in 2020. Keya said they made tremendous efforts to ensure efficiency in services to members by issuing instant sacco ATM cards. “It takes a maximum of two hours for a card to be processed. We again call upon our members to come and apply for the cards to enable them to enjoy sacco services efficiently,” he said. Edited by Henry Makori
