Oil prices jumped above $100 for the first time in more than seven years as President Putin announced a "military operation" in eastern Ukraine. News also caused Asian stock markets to trade lower by 2 to 3%. Markets have been taking a battering over the last few days as tensions escalated - prices hit $98 a few days ago when Mr Putin tore up a peace deal and ordered troops into two rebel-held eastern regions. The BBC's Asia business correspondent Mariko Oi says investors have been fleeing to what they consider safe-haven assets. Gold prices are at the highest level in over a year while the US dollar and the Japanese yen are also strengthening.
