A farmhand was mauled to death by dogs at his Kerundut home in Sotik, Bomet  county, on Sunday night under unclear circumstances. The man is said to have been attacked by nine dogs some metres away from the homestead as he walked back home at around 6pm. They killed him on the spot. Manaret location chief Edna Sigei, who confirmed the incident, said the badly mutilated body of the man was discovered in the wee hours of the morning after a search in the fateful night on his whereabouts. Sigei said the dogs behaved unusually in the morning with most of them having blood stains on their mouths and claws, a clear indication they attacked the man. “The body of the deceased had marks indicating he was attacked by animals. When we looked at the dogs they were behaving strangely with some having parts of their bodies covered with blood stains,” the administrator said. The incident attracted the response of the county disaster team and veterinary officers who visited the deceased's home. The administrator at the same time used the opportunity to ask residents to have their pets vaccinated for rabies. The body of the deceased was taken to Kapkatet Hospital morgue. Police are investigating the incident.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
