Corazon Kwamboka and Frankie Kiarie alias JustGymIt have broken up. Corazon announced she has broken up with the father of her two children with a black rose. "I’m single. I choose me. Life goes on." Split rumours emerged after she posted last year: "I feel so alone and sad. I want to have a genuine smile again, to be really happy," she wrote, adding that she was the kind of a person who would flip if her man was cheating on her but she no longer cares. "Now I don't care what he is doing behind my back. You lost a good person. I know all the things I come with and have to offer." The two have a son and a daughter together. Frankie has two other sons with Maureen Waititu. The two broke up a few years ago.
