ODM leader Raila Odinga has revisited the events that led to his handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. The former prime minister said when he arrived at Harambee House in March 2018, he first called Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka. The ODM leader insisted that he never kept his then NASA allies in the dark as he went to Harambees House. "Kwanza nilipigia Steve(Kalonzo Musyoka) lakini alikuwa mteja, lakini nikapigia Musalia ambaye aliniambia alikuwa uwanja wa ndege akienda Mombasa," Raila said. This is loosely translated: "I first called Steve (Kalonzo Musyoka) but his phone was switched off, I then phone Musalia who informed me that he was at the airport on his way to Mombasa." He went on: 'I later met them, there was nothing secret because we knew where we were going." Raila who was clarifying claims that he did not inform his allies in NASA of his handshake, said the president also called deputy president William Ruto. "He (Uhuru) called Ruto as I listen telling him that as he had informed him he was meeting me," Raila claimed. The DP had claimed that he was not kept abreast of the events that led to the handshake, reports Uhuru has discounted as dishonest. At the same time, Raila said Azimo-One Kenya must win the August 9 general election. 'We cannot afford to lose this election," Raila said at the Jubilee National Delegates Convention at KICC. He went on: 'If we stand together, there is nothing that will stop us from going forward.".
