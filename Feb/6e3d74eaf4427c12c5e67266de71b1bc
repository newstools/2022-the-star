President Uhuru Kenyatta's endorsement of the ODM leader Raila Odinga was warmly welcomed by Mt Kenya delegates who had turned up for his Sagana III meeting in Nyeri county. The President's speech was characterized by disparaging remarks aimed at his deputy William Ruto. He accused Ruto of refusing to partner with him in implementing his development projects to Kenyans. Uhuru had a soft spot for the ODM leader who he said their Handshake was instrumental in maintaining peace in the country. His address was welcomed by the delegates who gave him a standing ovation after he finished his speech and began chanting "yote yawezekana bila RutoI". Loosely translated as: " All is possible without Ruto." President Uhuru appealed to his community to back Raila now and apparently suggested that he will have no problem supporting Ruto if he reforms. "I'm asking you to support Raila Odinga as he means well for the Country. When "my young man reforms", we will consider him," Uhuru said. This is the first time President Uhuru was publicly telling his community that the ODM leader was his preferred successor.
