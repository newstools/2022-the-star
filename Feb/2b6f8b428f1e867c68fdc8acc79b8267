Industrialisation, Trade and Enterprise Development Chief Administrative Secretary David Osiany's father, Mzee Jared Osiany, is dead. Osiany announced his father's death on Wednesday. "My father, my friend, OSIEPA has rested. Brave, thoughtful, wise, measured, forthright and loving. That’s who we have lost. Always referring to me as OSIEPA (my friend), my father never called me by name. The tree under whose canopy we dwelt, has finally been cut. Awuoro!" he said in a tweet. Mzee Osiany, 62, died while undergoing treatment at a Nairobi hospital. President Uhuru Kenyatta has also sent his message of condolence to the Osiany family. Uhuru described Mzee Osiany as a patriot, who served with distinction and excelled as a long-serving public servant. “As a public servant, Mr Osiany was highly respected for his excellent service, high integrity and resourcefulness, especially during his long tenure as the Community Services Manager at Sony Sugar Company in South Nyanza," he said. The President described him as an astute promoter of small, micro and medium-sized enterprises where he mobilised resources and offered professional expertise for budding entrepreneurs. “We appreciate that in his retirement, Mr Osiany fully immersed himself in the small, micro and medium enterprises sector where he supported many upcoming entrepreneurs besides investing extensively in healthcare and agro-production," Uhuru said. The Head of State prayed for God's comfort to the family, friends and relatives of the Osiany family.
