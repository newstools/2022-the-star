Chief Justice Martha Koome on Wednesday announced 18 vacancies in the Political Parties Dispute Tribunal. In a statement, Koome said applications will be open from February 9 to February 16, 2022. "The Commission recognising the strict timelines and acting in the public interest has published a call for applications from persons interested in these positions. The application window will run from February 9 to 16, 2022 and the selection will be concluded thereafter," she said. The 18 new members will help speed up the dispute resolution process from cases that will arise. "The ad hoc members are expected to increase the capacity of the PPDT to resolve disputes arising from the electoral process within the strict statutory timelines." Successful members will serve for one year. The ad hoc positions were created following the recent signing of the enacted Political Parties (Amendment) Bill of 2021 into law by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Before the amendment, PPDT was composed of a chairperson and six members who held office for a non-renewable term of six years. The chairperson and five of these members are currently in office. Other changes brought by the Political Parties Act include; the concept of coalition political parties, outlining functions of political parties as well as changing the criteria of accessing the Political Parties Fund. The law also empowers the Registrar of Political Parties to certify political party membership lists and nomination rules among other transformative provisions aimed at strengthening management of political parties and enhancing democracy.
