Women's hockey Premier League side Orange Leonas will miss this season's competition, according to Kenya Hockey Union deputy fixtures secretary Moses Majiwa. The KHU league tips off on March 5 with the first leg set to end in July. The league season ends in November. The men's top-tier league remains unchanged with 10 teams expected to fight for the prestigious gong. They include Butali, Wazalendo, Kenya Police, Greensharks, Western Jaguars, USIU-A Masshujaa, Sailors, Strathmore, Parkroad Badgers, and Mombasa Sports Club. The women's cadre will feature seven teams following the withdrawal of Leonas. Seasoned champions Blazers, USIU-A Spartans, Strathmore Scorpions, Lakers, Amira, Sliders, and Wolverines will be in the race for the title. Leonas coach and founder, Tom Olal, said he does not have enough players for the season but will bounce back stronger in 2023. "The Covid-19 enforced break really hit us hard. Most of our players are students and education is a priority to them. We need to reorganize and reconstitute to be ready for next season because there's no way for us now," Olal said. He added: "We don't want to hold onto the players and slow down their development. If those available can find clubs to play for the season, it will help them." Ironically, most of the players and teams are composed of students. Majiwa on his part termed Leonas' absence as an unfortunate situation. He, however, challenged stakeholders to establish clubs that can be sustained in the longer term. "It is quite unfortunate that a team as young as Leonas won't be part of the competition in their second season in the top tier. We need people to establish clubs that can last for a longer period," Majiwa said. Majiwa added that the level of competition won't drop despite the setback. "The women's league will even be harder with few teams. If you drop points it will be tough to recover."
