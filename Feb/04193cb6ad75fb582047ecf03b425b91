Garissa leaders have urged residents to be more vigilant and report any suspicious persons to the authorities. Their appeal comes a week after suspected terror attacks in Mandera and Wajir counties. Some 11 people lost their lives through the IED attacks. The leaders cautioned residents against hiding or collaborating with al Shabaab members. They said in the end, the terrorists will turn against them and their people. The leaders spoke to the press at a local hotel in Garissa on Wednesday. The leaders led by Garissa county peace secretary Hassan Shurie said terrorists are Kenya’s main enemy and should not be supported at any cost. “We are warning anyone who might be collaborating with terrorists that no matter how much you help them, one day they will turn against you and your people,” Shurie said “Let us not keep people in our houses because they come from our clan. Tomorrow they will attack hospitals, schools or buses. We are the ones to lose at the end of the day,” Osman Abdi, a peace chairman in Dadaab said. Shurie further called for expeditious disarmament of all illegal firearms at the hands of civilians. He said they are being used to terrorise residents. He said community leaders are ready to work with security teams to help them seize the illegal firearms. He added that the weapons may be disastrous especially during this electioneering period. “I want to urge security officials to come up with quick ways of disarming illegal firearms especially in Garissa. We are ready to work with them but action must be taken once we share the information,” Shurie said. He also urged residents to be careful in campaign rallies. “Due to the big crowds militants may hide themselves and cause harm to the people,” he said. “We are also monitoring the utterances of our political leaders in campaigns. We will recommend tough action against any politician who will incite the citizens to violence,” he added (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
