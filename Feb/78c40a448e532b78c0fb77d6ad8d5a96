Senior government officials have called on Kenyans to adopt peaceful coexistence before, during and after the August 9 general election. The officials also called for tolerance among leaders and those seeking election as political temperatures rise by the day. The senior government caucus brings together Cabinet Secretaries, Principal Secretaries and  Chief Administrative Secretaries urged political leaders to exercise restraint and emphasise harmony. They noted that violence increases during the electioneering period. They spoke at Ol-Moran trading centre in Laikipia county where they delivered foodstuffs and bursary support for the families affected by the recent conflict sparked by bandits and illegal grazers. They repeated the government’s commitment to protect Kenyans and their property and said no one has the right to terrorise others or cause mayhem at any time. Led by PSs Jonson Weru (Trade), Mary Kimonye (Public Service), Kennedy Kihara (PAS-OP), they asked politicians to avoid zoning areas saying that impedes development and services. The leaders were accompanied by Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi and Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni. They condemned banditry attacks and invasion of private farms by illegal grazers seeking pasture. They said such individuals should not be spared and the government will use all its resources to deal with criminals. The team delivered the foodstuffs and bursary cheques worth more than Sh2.34 million, a contribution from the caucus. They also visited Kisii Ndogo village and Ol-Moran police station where houses were being reconstructed. The projects are being undertaken by the national government, Laikipia county and other partners. (Edited by V. Graham)
