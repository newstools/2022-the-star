Environment and Forestry Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko has appealed to the people of Maa nation to vote out the deputy president William Ruto come August 9, elections. Speaking in Kajiado county during the Azimio La Umoja meeting where ODM leader Raila Odinga was the chief guest, the CS said the DP is not fit for the top seat. Tobiko urged his community to back Raila for the presidency saying he is the best bet for the region. "The question that begs for an answer is, in whose hands are we safe? Let us vote in Raila and send Ruto to Sugoi for retirement," he said. The CS has been open in campaigning against the DP ever since he publicly referred to the DP as a "clerk". Tobiko has attended numerous rallies aimed at drumming up support for Raila. The ODM leader was in Kajiado where he went to listen to the grievances of the Maa nation even as he consolidate his support base ahead of the August elections. Leaders present included Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole Lenku, governor Ali Hassan Joho, Peter Kenneth, MP Junet Mohamed, Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina among others. Lenku also appealed to his community to back Raila saying he understands better the grievances of the Maa nation. At the same time, the Governor said they will work on modalities of fielding candidates as Azimio team in order to ensure the camp bags the majority seats.
