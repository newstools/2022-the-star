Some images have gone viral on social media with those sharing them claiming that it is that of Deputy President William Ruto arriving in the US. The images showed the DP carrying a flag and behind him is a Kenya Airways plane. A section of social media users claimed it was Ruto's reception on Sunday after arriving in the US. However, the Star has established that the images are of the DP's past event. The images were taken on October 30, 2018, when Ruto was receiving a Kenya Airways plane from New York in its first maiden trip. During the function, he was flanked by then US ambassador Robert Godec who is also seen in the picture. The images were taken when the Kenya Airways Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner touched down at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) marking the end of a complete maiden trip to the U.S. Ruto was at the airport to receive the delegation that included then Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Monica Juma
