Two murder fugitives who were arrested in Nairobi over the weekend have been extradited to face trial in the UK. Mohamud Abdihakim ,24 and Monteiro Mangal 21, both British nationals, were arrested on Sunday in Kilimani, following intelligence leads. An international arrest warrant had been issued against them for the brutal murder of a 16-year-old Alex Smith, from Wembley, in northwest London. Smith was attacked on August 12, 2019 in Munster Square, by a rival group of six men who were driving in two stolen vehicles, a Ford Fiesta and a Seat Leon. Police said he was stabbed at least twice in the chest before the attackers took flight, a brief by police said. Metropolitan police who have been looking for the suspects believe that one of the two arrested fugitives carried out the actual stabbing, while the other one was driving one of the stolen cars. The two had been hiding in Nairobi’s upmarket Kilimani suburbs while on the run, in an attempt to escape justice back in the U.K. During the arrest, Tariq was found in possession of a Somali identification card in the name of Abdulahi Abshir Mohamed and a dagger. Both were extradited to the UK to face justice for the crimes they committed. Two other men identified as Yusuf Yusuf and Arif Biomy are already serving their sentences in the UK for their role in the murder. Director Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI)  George Kinoti said Abdihakim was busted at AL-DAR apartments while his accomplice was seized from house a house in Mideya Gardens on January 26 where they have been hiding since sneaking into the country in 2019. Kinoti said Kenya will not be a safe haven for fugitives and warned any other suspect hiding their days are numbered. “If you commit a crime be ready to face the law. We will smoke you out,” he said. Kenya and UK have an extradition treaty hence the latest move, officials said.
