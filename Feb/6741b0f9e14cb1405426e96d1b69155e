The move by Russian President Vladimir Putin ordering the nuclear defence troops to put nuclear weapons on high alert has been condemned by worldwide leaders. On Sunday, Putin gave the order that is said to have been prompted by the move taken by the west to arm Ukraine. The Russian invasion enters its fifth day even as the representatives from both the warring nations continue to negotiate at the Belarus border with the aim to end the operation. According to the United Nations, the invasion has so far claimed more than 100 lives, and about half a million have been displaced from their homes. On Monday, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that nothing can justify the use of nuclear weapons. “We are facing a tragedy for Ukraine, but also a major regional crisis with potentially disastrous implications for us all. The mere idea of a nuclear conflict is simply inconceivable,” Guterres said through the Twitter account. The UN chief expressed his gratitude for the compassion, generosity, and solidarity of Ukraine’s neighbors who are taking in those seeking safety. “It is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity.”
