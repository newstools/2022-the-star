Nigerian artiste Skales is back with 'Nobody to Somebody', which is out now on all digital platforms. It gives a concise retelling of his life story, while offering motivation for anyone hoping to make the same jump in living conditions. “Nobody 2 Somebody” moves through a series of situations that see Skales urge his audience to keep at their work a bit to make a success of their life as he simultaneously prepares for the release of his next project. Deep into Nigeria’s Covid-19-enforced lockdown, he channelled the spirit of the times on his Healing Process EP, a meditative body of work that found him in a contemplative mood, recounting the price and process that took him to the peak of his profession. Much of the singer’s output in 2021 was a return to the pop hit-making form.
