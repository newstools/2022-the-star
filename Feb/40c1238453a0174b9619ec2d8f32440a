Over 500 families affected by HIV in Migori county have benefitted from food donations to cushion them from Covid effects and slump in economy. The International Community of Women Living with HIV and UNAIDS donated the food. Beneficiaries were vulnerable families from the six Migori subcounties of Kuria East, Kuria West, Suna West, Suna East, Uriri and Nyatike. The exercise started in December and will end in March with 125 families sharing donations worth Sh300,000 every month. “We decided to bring a smile on some of our most vulnerable members  and after the four months we will do a need assessment and see if we can continue with the donation,” Lavin Kenya director Peter Gwengi said. Gwengi was speaking at Kababu Polytechnic in Suna West constituency on Tuesday when he lead the food donation drive. Margret Akeyo, a beneficiary said the donation will help them and hoped it will continue for sometime. “We had people who were considering delaying or stop taking ARVs due to lack of food, we appreciate this gesture,” she said. John Abuoro, another beneficiary said through support groups of those living with HIV, they have been able to end stigma and counsel each other and it was through this that they picked beneficiaries. The beneficiaries received food baskets which comprised of sugar, rice, beans, cooking oil, sanitary towels, sanitisers and face masks.
