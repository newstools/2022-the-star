Narok Senator Ledama Ole Kina has disowned a woman who moved to court last year seeking to compel him to pay child support. The woman wanted the court to order the senator to pay Sh200,000 as child support. She claimed that they had a relationship with the legislator two years ago but he has since cut off communication with her. But Ledama through Lawyer Kethi Kilonzo has told the court that he does not know the child. “I do not know the child. It is not true that I had any relations with the woman,” Ledama says. In a one page short response, Ledama has further asked the court to order a DNA test on the minor. He said the woman had indicated that she did not object to a DNA test. The woman moved to court in November last year and sued the senator for child upkeep, alleging that they had an affair. In court papers, the woman claimed she met the senator in September 2019 and soon after were in an intimate relationship for a substantive period of time. She wanted the court to order the senator to pay monthly upkeep of Sh200,000 as child support for the one-year-old child. Through lawyer Ojijo Kepher, she says the child was born on October 22 last year. “When realised I was pregnant, I immediately informed the senator that he was going to be a father but to my dismay and utter shock, he cut off communication with me,” she said. She alleges that she went through pregnancy and even during the birth of the child alone and without any assistance or financial help from him. The woman said she was left with no other choice but to settle the bills of the prenatal and delivery all by herself without any involvement from Ole Kina. Edited by M. Asamba
