Kenyan lawyer Paul Gicheru on Tuesday pleaded not guilty to charges of corruptly influencing witnesses regarding a case involving Deputy President William Ruto. However, an edited video appeared on social media claiming that the lawyer pleaded guilty to the charges. The trial took place before Judge Miatta Maria Samba of Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The fact-checker has established that the 36-seconds video has been edited towards the end. According to the original video that the media shared from the international court, Judge Miatta Maria Samba asked the lawyer to rise; “Mr. Gicheru, can you rise, please. Do you understand the nature of the charges read out to you today?” The lawyer responded that: “Yes, I do, madam president.” The judge continued that: “Do you make an admission of guilt with respect to any of the charges?” Gicheru also responded that: “Madam president, for the record, I plead not guilty.” But a fake clip being circulated claims that the lawyer pleaded guilty to the charges. Also, from the clip, towards the manipulated part, there is silence, whereas in the original clip the lawyer is audible, eloquent, and clear before the court. Gicheru is accused of offences against the administration of justice in a case where Ruto was linked to crimes against humanity. The Ruto case was vacated in 2016 over insufficient evidence. The ICC, however, declined to acquit him. The trial started with the reading of the charges against Gicheru. The Chamber was satisfied that the accused understood the nature of the charges. Gicheru's arrest warrant was issued by the international court on March 10, 2015, but he surrendered to the authorities of The Netherlands on November 3, 2020.
