The former Youth Principal Secretary Lilian Omollo has declared her interest to vie for the Embu Senatorial seat in this year's general election. Omollo announced her interest in the position to the residents at her Rural home in Rukira village in Kithimu Manyatta Constituency, Embu County. The former PS was in the limelight in 2018 after she was allegedly involved in the NYS Sh9 million scandal. Speaking during the event, Lilian expressed her confidence in emerging victorious in the August polls. She said that she has enough knowledge to move the county forward in terms of development, and that should give residents reasons as to why they should elect her. "We all know what the work of the senator is, it is to protect and bring home funds. In my previous work, I dealt with public service work, a lot of financial management," said Ms Omollo. The PS, who has an active case in court, refused to comment about the matter and how it could affect her bid. She said that she is yet to decide on which political party she will be vying on. Omollo also said that no one should compare her to any other aspirant. “I do not think there is any aspirant in Embu who fits in my league. I will use my knowledge to help the people of Embu,” added Omollo The senator seat has attracted close to ten aspirants from the county. They include; Alexander Mundigi, Bosco Kiura, Pithon Muchoki, former Kamukunji MP Norman Nyaga, Embu Deputy Governor David Kariuki, University of Embu lecturer Fridah Karani and former Mungania tea factory director Samuel Mwafrika. Governor Martin Wambora is also said to be interested in the position but he is yet to announce his bid.
