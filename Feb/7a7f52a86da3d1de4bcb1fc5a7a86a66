Vihiga Queens' coach Boniface Nyamunyamu feels the Kenya Women's Premier League title is still wide open despite his side opening a 5-point lead against second-placed Gaspo. The gaffer dismissed the favourites' tag after the Enez Mango captained side battered Wadadia 8-1 on Saturday while Gaspo dropped points in their 1-1 drab draw with Ulinzi Starlets. Christine Nafula, Topista Situma, Joan Nabirye, and Maurine Achieng shouldered the goal-scoring burden by bagging a brace each in the absence of top scorer Tereza Engesha. Engesha, who has nine goals, skipped the match after rumours that she had exited the club. "We have won nothing yet. What we have done is build momentum, which is very vital at this point in time," Nyamunyamu said. "It's premature to talk about the title yet the league isn't even halfway. Our rivals have room to close the gap and walk to the podium because there are many matches to play. We have to keep winning because our rivals will capitalise on any slip-ups and get themselves back on track," he said. Nyamunyamu confirmed that Engesha's expected departure is drawing closer. He, however, expects the maverick forward to feature in the remaining three matches of the first leg before moving. "The management is dealing with that but her exit is inevitable. We need her services against Kangemi, Thika, and Bunyore and we expect her to give 100 per cent." Nyamunyamu, who is in his first season as Vihiga coach, said he has enough cover in Engesha's position and their latest victory is a further testament to the quality at the club. "The team can be ruthless without Engesha because when she plays she happens to be the centre of attention and the players are forced to adjust to her style. She was out but the rest of the squad stepped up."
