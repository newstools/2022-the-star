The Elections Amendment Bill 2022 has proposed doing away with live streaming of election results. It has also proposed reverting to manual rather than electronic transmission of results. This Bill will be a backward step if it is passed into law. Rather than fixing the problems with the electronic system, it wants to turn back the clock to a manual system. Yes, there were problems with electronic transmission from around two-thirds of polling stations in 2017 but this was mainly due to 3G being inadequate for data transmission. This will be less of a problem in 2022 because telecoms have upgraded their networks. There was no 'failure' of live transmission in 2017. There was suspicion because Uhuru took any early lead that continued as results came in. But this was natural and normal. The first set of results from around 300 polling stations was effectively a randomised opinion poll across the country. It was to be expected that that pattern would be maintained as more results came in. If Parliament blocks electronic transmission and live streaming, it lays the ground for even greater suspicion of election results. MPs should not pass these amendments.
