Four cars have been burnt after a trailer transporting gas cylinders exploded at Mutarakwa on the Mai Mahiu - Nairobi road. Orange flames and black smoke billowed from the burning vehicles as a crowd mulled around the area to witness the incident. Witnesses stood at a distance as the trailer smoldered, reducing everything in its vicinity to soot and ashes. "The trailer was transporting gas cylinders along the busy highway when it burst into flames," witnesses said. Fire fighters were seen trying to put out the fire as other Kenyans were busy taking pictures. Pictures taken from the scene showed the lorry in huge flame which also caught several cars there. Several emergency teams were sent to the scene. Limuru sub county police commander Eilen Mola said the tanker was transporting gas to Kisumu, when it developed mechanical problem. It was at this point that it exploded near Ngenia high school along the Nairobi Mai Mahiu road burning four other vehicles. Mola said a team of detectives have been sent to the scene to establish the status of the victims. "As of now, we do not know the number nor the status of the victims. We have sent a team of police officers from Tigoni police station investigate"she said. The incident happened at about 11.30 am. Motorists using the route were advised to use alternatives. Police spokesman Bruno Shioso said they were waiting for more details on the incident.
