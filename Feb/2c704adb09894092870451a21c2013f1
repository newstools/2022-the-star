Kabuchai MP Majimbo Kalasinga has lauded the Senate for scrapping the degree requirement for aspirants in August 9 polls. Addressing the press in Bungoma county at the Ford Kenya headquarters on Wednesday, Kalasinga said leaders should only be judged by their ability to lead. "We have many people with leadership qualities but they lack degrees. This amendment has given them a chance to vie for elective seats ," he said. However, Kalasinga asked Ford Kenya to hold free and fair nominations for aspirants. He added that the party will field candidates in every constituency in Bungoma county. "From today, we are releasing our leader Moses Wetang'ula to go out and assist Deputy President William Ruto in seeking for votes as I take over  Bungoma campaigns," he said. The MP said DAP-K party has no capacity to compete with Ford Kenya in Western Kenya. “DAP-K party is a State House strategy to interfere with Western region votes but I want to tell my brother Eugene Wamalwa that they won’t beat us,” Kalasinga said. He urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to stop imposing ODM leader Raila Odinga on Kenyans. “I am shocked to see Uhuru endorsing Raila but even if he supports him, he won't win,” he said.
