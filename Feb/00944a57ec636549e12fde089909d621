Eric Omondi created mixed reactions from his fans when he said that he has no wife and kid. In an interview with Wasafi Media, he said "I tried to get a wife from my show 'Wife Material' but I failed. I am turning 40 years old, sina mtu, sina mtoto, sina bibi." He has now clarified that he did not deny fathering a child with Jacque Maribe and that his remarks were taken out of context. "I was talking about my life turning 40. I have no house or kids to go home to. I want kids who will welcome me when I get home. I need two kids this year (two girls), so pray for me," he told Mungai Eve.
