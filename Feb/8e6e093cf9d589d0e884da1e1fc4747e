Police in Kirinyaga County have launched investigations into the death of two robbery suspects. The two are said to have been involved in a bar brawl in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The two are said to be part of a gang consisting of nine individuals who allegedly broke into the bar based along the Kutus-Kianyaga road. According to the bar owner Paul Kigundu, the armed gang allegedly stripped the watchman, after which they tied him up before accessing his premises. They are later said to have broken into the bar counter when a quarrel allegedly broke out. They allegedly turned against each other using the crude weapons they possessed, leading to the death of the two. "I was alerted of the incident by one of my workers. When I came in to respond to the matter, I found the two bodies lying on the floor and shards of glasses all over." "The watchman narrated to me how they broke in at around midnight. They stripped him and tied him up before proceeding into the bar." Kigundu, who is still reeling in shock, says he is yet to evaluate the loss incurred. Kirinyaga county police commander Mathew Mang'ira confirmed the incident, saying they have launched investigations. Mang'ira revealed that before the incident, the gang is suspected to have argued about some money they had received from an unknown source. He said they are investigating to establish whether they had received the money from a local politician. He added that they have also launched a manhunt for the other seven members of the gang who went into hiding after the incident. "We are still probing where they came from before heading to the bar and why they were arguing. However, we suspect that they were arguing over some money they received. We have since ordered the watchman on duty to record a statement," he said. The bodies of the deceased were taken to the Kerugoya hospital mortuary by the police officers.
