Tatu City in partnership with Access Afya have launched an affordable healthcare enterprise to benefit residents living around the smart city. Patients will be charged as low as Sh100 for consultation and annual coverage from Sh1,500. Under the Curafa Medical Clinic franchise, the facility is set to improve access to primary healthcare for the community. The clinic, located near the Tatu City entrance, will serve more than 10,000 local community members and thousands of workers in the city. Speaking during the launch, Perminas Marisi, head of City Management, Tatu City, said they are delighted to open the facility as part of their commitment to social transformation and improving the lives of the local community. “We are excited to expand Curafa to Tatu City and are confident that customers will appreciate our seven-day-a-week affordable healthcare services with consultations,” Daphne Ngunjiri, Access Afya’s CEO said. Access Afya’ tech-enabled primary health clinics in Kenya have served over 350,000 patients. The company’s digital system, AfyaSmart, tracks numerous quality indicators to ensure consistent and effective care every time. Tatu City, through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes, has been empowering the local community for a decade. Some of the notable initiatives include capacity building at the Tatu City Training Academy, which offers free vocational training to the community. So far, more than 500 individuals have been trained in masonry, plumbing, plastering, steel fixing and security. Upon completion of the course, more than 80 per cent of graduates find work in Tatu City. Other CSR initiatives include educational support programmes, women empowerment and environmental conservation.
