The Eldoret derby between Eldoret RFC and the University of Eldoret’s Trojans will be the highlight of the Kenya Rugby Union matchday 8 on Saturday. Eldoret RFC coach David Wachie and Kelvin Mwisheni have promised their fans a highly entertaining game at Eldoret Sports Club. Wachie said: “Being a local derby, we expect a tough game but we will be going for maximum points. We have prepared well and the boys are ready for the game. We have a full squad and playing at home gives us an added advantage.” “We are on course for a semi-final position which is our target. Last season, we missed a playoff berth by a whisker,” he added. Eldoret’s technical bench has been boosted after former Kenyan international Lawi Buyachi joined the team as a forwards coach. Mwisheni said: “It is a must-win game for us because we are not in a good position. If we lose the game, we sink further into the relegation zone. We have already recalled six experienced players who are on attachment for the game. We want to parade our best team for the game.” “It will not be an easy game but we are going for a win,” he added. Eldoret are 7th on the log with 14 points while UOE are eighth with 13 points. Log leaders Catholic Monks hope to extend their lead when they face South Coast Pirates at Seacrest while second-placed Mean Machine will play newbies Kabarak FC in Nakuru. Bottom of the table Egerton Wasps will play former Kenya Cup side Western Bulls at Nakuru Athletics Club while Northern Suburbs will host Kisumu RFC at the Catholic University of East Africa in Langata. United States International University Africa’s Martials will be at home against Shamas Foundation.
