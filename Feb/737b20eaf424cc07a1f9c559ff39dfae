The Council of Governors chairperson Marin Wambora on Monday left President Uhuru Kenyatta and members of the public in stitches after reading an old speech. President Uhuru launched the Universal Health Coverage in Mombasa County where he was accompanied by a number of government officials. Embu Governor Wambora took to the stage with a piece of paper ready to make his speech at the function whose agenda touches on county governments. With all eyes set on him, Wambora started well by recognizing the leaders present and thereafter kicked off his speech. “Only one minute your Excellency. I always take one minute, a maximum of two. On behalf of the Council of Governors, I take this opportunity to express my pleasure to be part of this national launch. "From the onset eeh, eeeh…your Excellency hii ni ile nilisoma kule, iyo ingine…(starts looking for the other speech under his chair before turning to the mic)…oh, sawa sawa, iyo ingine nilisahau kwa gari ya Minister for Health, lakini ni sawa,” Wambora said amidst laughter from those present. He then proceeded with his speech saying the council was pleased with the president’s move to invite them to the function. “Tutahakikisha county zile zingine zote arubaini na sita, kama Mombasa, tumeiga mtindo wa president kuhakikisha tumeimarisha Universal health Coverage mara moja. Kwa hayo machache, asanteni sana.” Loosely translates to: "We will ensure as county governments that we become part of the universal health coverage. We are going to implement the programs at our county governments immediately so that we complement the president's efforts".
