Rosemary Odinga, the daughter of ODM party leader Raila Odinga, can now see clearly. Rosemary, 44, is currently in India for a routine medical check-up after she suffered an eyesight problem in 2019. “Before coming to India for treatment, I was pretty much living in darkness. I was simply existing not living,” she told India’s online news platform Don News. Rosemary said she had a tumour in the brain. "One of my aneurysms was leaking, resulting in the stroke. My father heard about the treatment from a friend,” she said. Rosemary said, after some time, she went on with the routine treatment in India. "When I went for eye testing, they checked and asked if I could not see. But I could see the doctors very clearly," she said. Early in the week, Raila opened up about his daughter Rosemary’s illness, for the first time, revealing a mistake by Kenyan doctors interfered with her eyesight. Raila explained the circumstances that led to Rosemary’s eyesight complications and plunged the family into distress and desperate attempts to help her. He spoke in an interview with Asian News International while on his trip to India. The former prime minister said his daughter had developed a brain haemorrhage and was taken to hospital for surgery. “My daughter got sick about three years ago. She had haemorrhage as a result of which she was operated in Nairobi,” he told ANI. “In the process of that operation, somehow they interfered with the optic nerve,” Raila said, lifting the lid on the genesis of his daughter’s eyesight complications. In 2017, Rosemary was diagnosed with a brain haemorrhage in a Nairobi hospital. A brain haemorrhage is leaking or bleeding of blood inside the brain caused by the rupture of a blood vessel. Medical doctor Bernard Muia said the condition has several causes including bulging of the vessels and high blood pressure.
