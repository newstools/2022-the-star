Renowned film producer and director Eugene Mbugua became a millionaire in his early 20s. In an interview with Word Is, Mbugua said he became an entrepreneur during his days at campus. "University education opens one's mind, you got to learn how to think. I was a part-time student from 5pm to 9pm, and during the day, I would work." Mbugua said university taught him how to think, and he had several hustles while still pursuing his undergraduate studies. "I had a bunch of businesses while at the university, a video game arcade, selling movies, a tour company that failed, I was teaching at Makini school." The 'Young Rich' producer said he needed to survive. "It came as a necessity, I needed to survive, to be able to save money to live. I wouldn't say I was entrepreneurial at birth, it was an instinct that came naturally." Mbugua joined the film stage after his cousin took him to a film set, where he was an extra on set and immediately started practising to make short films. Mbugua's breakthrough came just before he hit 22 years. "I held my first million just before I turned 22. I started as an extra, doing odd jobs, then started teaching film in primary school," he said. "This whole time I wanted not to climb the ladder but to own it." He has gradually become one of the most-sort-after docu-reality filmmakers in Kenya, having created 'Concert Nyumbani', 'Foods of Kenya', 'Get In the Kitchen', 'Our Perfect Wedding', 'Stori Yangu', 'Sol Family' and Wahu and Nameless' 'This Love'.
