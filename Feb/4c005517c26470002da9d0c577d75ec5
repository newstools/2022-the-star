Police in Kisii were on Tuesday pursuing two brothers suspected of slaughtering their father on Monday. The two, Boniface Osoro, alias Bob, and Geraro Osoro, disappeared at 9am on Monday. The incident occurred in Kiamiosori, Bobasi. Police said the suspects used a slasher and a kitchen knife to kill Pius Osoro, 60. They left the weapons behind. Neighbours found the body of Osoro on the floor of the house. "It had deep cuts to the left collar bone, chest and right wrist," a police report said. Neighbour Rose Tarimbo claimed the sons have been having problems with their father. County police commander Francis Kooli said the hunt for the two would continue. "Their arrest would help unravel the motive," he told journalists. Edited by A.N
