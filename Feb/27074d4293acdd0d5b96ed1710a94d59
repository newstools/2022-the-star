WildlifeDirect has launched Season two Wildlife Warriors television series. The Series produced by WildlifeDirect CEO Dr. Paula Kahumbu aims at shining a light on local conservation heroes and create a platform to educate, inspire and stir up a call to action within viewers to value and care about nature. During the official screening of the film at Karen Karen Blixen Coffee Gardens on Friday, Kahumbu shed light on the inspiration behind it. "We wanted to show how we could tap into our traditional knowledge and culture that is part of our value system as African people, as Kenyans. Wildlife Warriors is about getting people to stop and think and join us to work together to save our wildlife,” she said. Kahumbu also condemned the proposed changes to a section of the Forest Conservation and Management Act 2016, which protects forests from actions that endanger any rare, threatened, or endangered species. "We need to educate all Kenyans, we need people to understand why forests matter." Through the World Warriors Season two, Kahumbu wants all Kenyans to love their wildlife, know every single member of the Marsh Pride. ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru reiterated the importance of such films, promising that the government will support them through providing equipment and setting up funds for the same. “To protect our wildlife, we cannot do it without recording this information for everybody.  I find it very important to find ways of engaging and ensuring that these films are available to every person in the world so that they can see what we have. I feel very proud to see this done in Kenya," Mucheru said. The 13 part series that features more than 20 heroines and heroes will premiere on Kenyan television screens. The production of the series was made possible with the support of the US Agency for International Development, the US Department of Interior, the Wild Lives Foundation, and the Great Plains Foundation.
