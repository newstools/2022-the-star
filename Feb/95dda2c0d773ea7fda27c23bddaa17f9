It is all systems go for Cricket Kenya elections on Saturday after the Independent Elections Panel released the names of contestants for nine positions. Manoj Narshi Patel, Chidamabaran Swaramanian, and Tariq Iqbal have thrown their hats in the ring for the chair's post as former Kenyan One Day International captain and right-handed batsman Thomas Odoyo battles Maina Kiruma for the vice chair's post. Former national team wicketkeeper and right-handed batsman Kennedy Obuya looks set to be the new county associations representative as there is no other contestant eyeing the same post. Other candidates include Peter D’ Costa and Kalpesh Solanki (treasurer) as well as Pearlyne Omamo (director, women's cricket). While releasing the final list of those eligible for elections, the Independent Elections Panel chair Kenneth Mutuma said the nine have undergone a verification process before being cleared to vie. "A verification process was undertaken to ascertain the credibility and eligibility of the aspiring candidates. Candidates not cleared have received communication on the same with reasons as to why they could not be cleared," Mutuma said. All contestants are expected to attend a civic education program this afternoon ahead of the polls. "There will be a voter civic education program this afternoon. Communication has been made to candidates that have been cleared by the IEP," Mutuma said.
