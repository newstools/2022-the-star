Yes, these cute furry animals are edible and their meat is very tasty and soft. Tired of the monotony of beef, poultry, and seafood?  Let me introduce you to a new recipe that will have you not only licking your plate but rambling to all your friends about it. Rabbit meat is considered to be one of the healthiest meat in the world, with the highest protein content and lowest fat content. This white meat has an almost chicken-like taste but actually sweeter. Ingredients Method Place the bacon strips into a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Allow them to cook for around 10 minutes or until the fat has rendered and they're crisp, transfer them to a plate lined with kitchen towels. In a large bowl, season the rabbit legs with the spices and salt, using your hands to knead, rub in the spices so that they're well absorbed into the meat. Heat a large cooking pan with oil over a medium-high heat source, add in the rabbit meat and allow it to turn brown on each side. It would take about 4 minutes Take them off the heat source and place them on the plate with the strips. Wash and chop your onions and crush your garlic cloves. Add oil to a cooking pot and allow it to heat, add the onions and allow them to turn brown, then add crushed garlic and cook for a few minutes. Pour in cider into the pot and stir, then add the bacon and rabbit and bubble for a minute while stirring gently. Pour in the stock, add mustard stir then cover the pot. Bring the meal to simmer, then reduce to a gentle bubble over a low heat source. Once the soup reduces, stir in the cream and simmer for a few minutes. Garnish with chopped tarragon/ dill. Serve with a side of your liking and enjoy.
