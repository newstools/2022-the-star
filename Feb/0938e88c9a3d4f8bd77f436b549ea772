Deputy President William Ruto, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula have kicked off their campaigns in Kwale county. The tour is part of the efforts to strengthen friendship, seek support from the locals and popularise the Kenya Kwanza Alliance ahead of the August 9, polls. It is the first time Ruto is touring the region since UDA formed an alliance with ANC and Ford-Kenya parties. Ruto first launched the phase two construction of Sh450 million Kwale modern stadium and recording studio at Kwale cultural Centre in Matuga alongside governor Salim Mvurya among other leaders. He will later address the residents and sell his manifestos. His visit has brought together most of the Kwale leaders. The leaders have been working separately since the December 15, 202,0 Msambweni by-election. In the Msambweni mini-poll, Ruto supported independent candidate Feisal Bader who had the backing of a majority of Kwale leaders. Matuga MP Kasim Sawa Tandaza (ANC) who stood neutral during the polls, on Saturday shared the same dais with other leaders solidifying unity. On Friday Ruto was in Taita-Taveta and pitched camp in Kilifi where he drummed up support for their new alliance. They also condemned the proposed changes of the election law allowing for manual transmission of results. Later on, the DP will head to Likoni and Totonoka ground in Mombasa for a big rally before ending his coastal visit.
