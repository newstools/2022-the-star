Jubilee Party is holding the first National Delegates Conference meeting at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. The party’s meeting will be held on February 25 and 26. There is a low turnout at the party's NDC meeting, with some empty seats yet to be filled. The delegates, most of whom are in red T-shirts, caps are set to see the position the party will be taking in the upcoming elections. Among those who arrived include Naomi Shaban, former MP Kwanza Noah Wekesa and Tigania East MP Mpuru Aburi. Coast-based artiste Ali B performed for the congregation. The agenda of the NDC includes a review of the Party's policies as well as an amendment and/or ratifying proposed changes to the Jubilee Party constitution to comply with current electoral laws. The party is also set to approve the proposed new seal, symbol, and flag of the Party.
