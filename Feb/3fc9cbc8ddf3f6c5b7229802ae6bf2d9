Team ALS Motorsport's Aslam Khan and Assad "Bones" Mughal say they are ready for the unforgettable adventure offered by the East African Safari Classic. The two are among drivers who will be competing at the one-week event from February 10-18. Veteran Aslam will be navigated by his brother, Arshad, in a Porsche 911 (car no. 25), whereas Mughal will be navigating Shakeel Khan in a Ford Escort MK1 (car no. 29). Aslam said he is under minimal pressure and is hopeful this will work to his advantage. "The Classic is here with us again- let's go have some fun. When having fun, you actually do better as there is minimal pressure," Aslam said. Similarly, Mughal says their minimal target is to finish in the top 15 places. "We plan to take it one day at a time, save the cars and get to the finish line in Watamu. We want to get both cars to the finish hopefully in the top 15. In this event, there is no classification if you get out even if you restart," Mughal said. He added: "So, everyone will have to be careful. The essence is to keep it clean and bring the car home daily. After the rest day, we'll analyse where we lie, and then we can up the pace if needed. That's always the time when it dawns. This is real. This is happening. All the weeks and months of prep have now led us here." Aslam and Arshad had a very good run in last year's Mini Classic, which served as a test run for the main event. They had a good, clean run and brought their Porsche home in a credible 8th position. Shakeel and Assad had a potential 6th overall but a broken shaft ended their rally, 20km from the end of last stage. Since then, both cars have been rechecked and rebuilt in readiness for the main event. Both cars passed scrutineering on Monday well in time for action.
