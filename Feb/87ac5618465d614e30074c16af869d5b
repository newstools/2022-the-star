At least 16 people have been killed as Storm Eunice carved a deadly trail across Europe. Deaths were reported in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, the Irish Republic and the UK, as fierce winds felled trees and sent debris flying. Millions of homes and businesses lost power across Europe and transport networks were left in disarray. The Dutch coastguard said it was trying to locate 26 empty shipping containers lost in the North Sea. Gusts of more than 120mph (almost 200 km/h) were recorded on Friday.

Three people were killed on roads in England, two more died in Germany and two people have died in Belgium, including a man hit on the head by a solar panel blown off a building in Ghent.

The 40ft (12m) shipping containers were lost from the Panama-registered Marcos V around the Wadden Islands, en route to Germany.

Elsewhere in the Netherlands parts of the roof of the stadium of football team ADO Den Haag was ripped off in the Hague and high speed trains to Belgium, France and the UK were cancelled. In Germany rail operator Deutsche Bahn said "more than 1,000km" (620 miles) of track had suffered damage.
