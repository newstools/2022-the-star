The United Democratic Alliance party National Treasurer Omingo Magara has quit UDA. Magara said he quit after considerable reflection and consultation with his people of Kisii County. "..my political future and ambitions cannot be sufficiently addressed by the UDA party. I therefore immediately resign as a party member and as a treasurer," "This has been such a heavy decision to make, as we must always allow the voice of the people we seek to lead to prevail over and above our personal ambitions." Magara said the voice of the people seeks to be wanting a different direction from the path he is currently on,. "The voice of the people is ultimately the voice of God," he said. "Let us be vigilant for politics comes and goes but we as a people and as a nation, must remain united to allow us usher in the golden age of our republic." On Sunday, Magara denied claims that he had quit as his name filled the social, with claims of resignation from the party. According to the information that went viral on social media, Magara, who is a close ally of the Deputy President William Ruto had resigned and was about to join the Azimio la Umoja Movement. Through his official Twitter account, Magara dismissed the allegations as rumours and asked Kenyans to ignore them. His resignation comes a day after Kisii governor aspirant ditched DP Ruto’s party citing frustrations. Otundo said she is scouting for a new party. She said UDA pulled her down at the last minute in favour of Nyaribari Masaba MP Ezekiel Machogu, seeking to succeed Governor James Ongwae.
