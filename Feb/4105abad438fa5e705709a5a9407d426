ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his ODM counterpart Raila Odinga in 2013 locked horns in their bids to clinch the presidency. Mudavadi had given his first stab at the presidency while Raila was on his third attempt. Though the Western region was considered as the political bastion of the ANC leader, Raila dwarfed Mudavadi in all counties except Vihiga. Mudavadi beat Raila in Vihiga with less than 5,000 votes.
