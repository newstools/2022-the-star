COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli has said he is preparing to leave a rich legacy as heads to retirement after the August 9, elections. Speaking in an interview at KTN News on Wednesday, Atwoli said he is focused on leaving a mark including seeing ODM leader Raila Odinga becomes the fifth president of Kenya. He added that all the four presidents who have served this country, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, have first been in the opposition before clinching the presidency. “Ruto will never be the president of Kenya…where does he come from? You can’t come out of the blue skies and claim that you want to be the president of the Republic of Kenya…what are the credential of William Ruto? Have you listened to him every time he is talking? The same message now and then and he is bitter and Kenyans are watching,” Atwoli said. He dismissed the huge crowd being pulled by the DP in his rallies adding that some of the leaders used to pull such crowds years back but they never made it to the State House. Atwoli added there will be no rerun in the August poll and that Raila will beat Ruto hands down early in the morning. “There will be no re-run on August 9, election. Take it to the bank. That is the day you will know Atwoli is an elder.” Atwoli said he is interested in who becomes the president because that will determine the fate of the workers in this country. “Labour movements are pressure groups; any labour leader must check on the government.” Atwoli dismissed the claims that ANC and Ford-Kenya's recent move to team up with Ruto will split western region votes. He said that the region is locked in the Azimio. "UDA will be like a village party. There is nothing like Kenya Kwanza...Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula joined UDA because they were looking for an exit strategy."
