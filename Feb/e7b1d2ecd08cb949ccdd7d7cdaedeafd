ODM leaders in Garissa are recruiting members to popularise the party ahead of the August polls. Mohamed Ali, the county ODM chairman who is also the minority leader in the county assembly, said their main aim is to upscale membership. The consultative meeting was held at a hotel in Garissa town. “Garissa is a stronghold for both Jubilee and ODM. We are going to make sure it remains that way," Ali said. Ali said they intend to field ODM candidates in all positions. “This whole region is now in Azimio. In Garissa, we only have one MP left out. We want to ask Aden Duale to come back home,” Ali said. “Numbers don’t lie. In the 2013 and 2017 elections Raila led in this region. This time, we have the president on our side, we will vote at least 80 per cent for Raila,” he said. Abdi Welly, ODM secretary in Garissa county, said the former Prime minister is the only leader who has the best interests for the pastoralist community. “Raila has a special plans for education, agriculture and livestock in the North eastern which he spoke about on December 10 last year," said Welly.
