Kibaki’s grandson Sean Andrew does not want to have children of his own. The famous model said this in a recent Q and A session with his fans. "I just don't want kids. It's something I've known for a long time," he said. In a past online session with his fans, Sean was asked if he ever thought of getting married and settling down. "Yes, I’ve thought of it, but I don’t see myself being a father. A husband maybe, but I don’t want kids. Never have," he replied. Asked if he is seeing someone, he said, "Yet to find someone on my wavelength." Sean also said he had used a matatu once for the experience. "I even tipped the driver. He thought I was mad." Sean said he has faced a number of challenges in life. "Mental health, bullying, anxiety...I'm not perfect nor do I wish to be. I am sure we all have a story, someday I'll tell you mine."
