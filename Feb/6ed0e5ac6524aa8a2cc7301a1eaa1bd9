Top-notch development in wizardry technology has arrived with the new iPhone updates. Harry Potter fans who have iPhones can now cast default spells as well as create their own custom spells with the Shortcuts app to perform tasks. According to Gadget Hacks, Apple's Siri function now includes three familiar built-in spells, "Lumos" which turns on the phone's flashlight "Nox" that turns it off and lastly "Accio," followed by the name of a specific app, which will in turn launch that app. An example of the third command is uttering, "Accio Snapchat" which in turn opens the app. Notably, in order for the spells to function, Hey Siri must be enabled. This can be done by selecting "Siri & Search" under Settings then choosing "Listen for 'Hey Siri." Keep in mind, if you try using Siri by long-pressing the Side or Home button or using Type to Siri, the spells won't work. Note: however, toggling on "Allow Siri When Locked," will allow users to be able to cast spells even when their screens are locked. On the other hand, enabling "Always listen for Hey Siri" will ensure that the spells work even when the iPhone is lying face down. Some of the additional spells include "Lumos Maxima" which turns on your flashlight to maximum brightness, "Silencio" which activates the Do Not Disturb mode, "Sonorus" which turns the volume up to 100% and "Quietus" to turn the volume all the way down. On top of the default spells, users can custom make spells with the Shortcuts function, making the possibilities endless. To enable this, users go to the Shortcuts app, then tap the "plus" symbol in the upper-right corner and select Add Action. Afterwards, they can easily search and select the function they want, from opening apps to selecting airplane mode then tap Next and allocate the Shortcut name "spell." Then proceed to cast their custom made spells.
