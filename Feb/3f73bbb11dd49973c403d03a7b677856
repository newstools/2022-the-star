ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday said that he will create a ministry that will be in charge of specifically youth affairs. According to Raila, the ministry will also mainstream the appointment of youths into government. The former Prime Minister said at independence, young leaders did a significant job in preparing Kenya for the future that is now. "The foundation these young leaders laid, has brought Kenya this far. My Government will create a stand-alone Ministry for Youth affairs and mainstream their appointments," Raila said. In October last year, the Orange party boss promised to appoint at least four youths into his Cabinet if elected President on August 9. Raila insisted that he will place the young generation at the heart of his administration. He pointed out that when he served as Prime Minister during the grand coalition government, he did not let down the youth. “When I was the prime minister, I had round table meetings with the business community and also the youth. The round table meetings were being held quarterly so that we can get feedback from the youth on what problems they are facing and what we are doing. It is something I have tried before and will be part of my policy,” Raila said. He called on young people to be part of his journey by campaigning for him. The ODM boss promised to establish a youth-dedicated department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since a majority of the citizen living outside the country are youth. According to the 2019 census, the youths are 75 per cent of the 47.6 million population. These statistics have forced the 2022 presidential candidates to come up with youth-friendly policies to appease the key segment of the electorate. Deputy President William Ruto, Raila’s presumed main opponent in the 2022 presidential duel, has anchored his campaigns largely on youth-centred policies.
