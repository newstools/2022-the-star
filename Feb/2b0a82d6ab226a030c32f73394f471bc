Dancehall singer Redsan is paid more than Sh1 million per show. Speaking during an interview with Radio Maisha, Redsan said he is paid that amount because of the kind of content he has. "I am paid how I want, according to my work. 10,000 dollars (1M) is not enough, but it is a good start," he said. "I do not know about the other artistes because I have never seen their contracts. I am paid good, mkitaka kucatch ni sawa." Redsan also spoke about royalties being poorly distributed. "We are not being paid our royalties. There are cases in court going back to five years ago," he said. "People also became personal instead of working as a team. Cartels came up and you have to pay for your music to be played."
