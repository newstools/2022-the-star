Experienced winger Kevin Kimani has joined Bandari, the coastal club confirmed in a statement yesterday. "We are pleased to announce that Bandari have signed international Kimani from Wazito FC. Kimani has vast experience acquired while playing in and outside the country. Welcome to Bandari, Kimani," the statement added. Kimani's departure from Wazito is a further signal of the reported financial struggles that the side owned by Ricardo Badoer have endured over the last couple of years. His arrival in Mombasa will be welcome news to Bandari coach Andre Casa Mbungo as he seeks to bolster his goal-shy attack. Kimani is expected to form a partnership with fellow international Abdalla Hassan, Umaru Kasumba, and regular goal poacher William Wadri. The Dockers' return of 17 goals in 15 matches is the joint lowest in the top half of the table. It has undermined their pursuit for a first league title as the season enters second stage.
