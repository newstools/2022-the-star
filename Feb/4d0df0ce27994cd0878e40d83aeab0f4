Kanu chairman  Gideon Moi gets the nod to engage other political players for a partnership ahead of the August 9 polls. Kanu's National Executive Council (NEC) on Wednesday said they have given the Baringo Senator the nod to source for like-minded partners for a coalition. "We bestow our national chairman the mandate to initiate structured and honest dialogue with other political formations ahead of the stipulated April 9 deadline, as an equal partner, and nothing less," secretary-general Nick Salat said. Salat read NEC's resolution after a closed-door meeting held at Kabarnet gardens. "With the reality of coalition politics in 2022, electoral mapping of the country is inevitable for optical poll performance," Salat said
