Deputy President William Ruto will on Tuesday head to Kajiado in a bid to woo the Maa community to back his presidential bid. During his tour of the region, the second in command is expected to visit Kajiado East and South constituencies, where he will hold meetings with area residents. He is scheduled to make stopovers in Nguso, Kimana and Kitengela, where he will sell his Bottom-Up economic agenda. His tour of the county comes just a day after he launched the second phase of the Bottom-up consultative meetings in Nyeri. “This is part of the ongoing Hustler nation discourse, where Kenyans in the agriculture and business sectors at the bottom of the economic and social pyramid, will prioritize their need and propose the solutions to transform their economic welfare,” he said in a statement. The meetings will take place across the 47 counties and will end in March 2022. Early February, the DP, who had seemingly taken a strategy break from the campaign trail. had his Kenya Kwanza coalition partners, Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetangula tour the county to popularise his bid ahead of the August 9 polls. Azimio la Umoja leader Raila Odinga is still out of the country. He left last week for a 10-day tour of Ethiopia and India.
