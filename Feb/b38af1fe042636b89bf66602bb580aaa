A passenger has been nabbed with Sh238 million at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. A statement from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) shows the suspect arrived from Bujumbura, Burundi with a packed parcel containing $2 million. KRA officials nabbed the suspect after noting inconsistencies in the information he had provided at the airport. He had produced different entry and export support requests. According to the Customs and Border, Control commissioner,  the suspect had made a declaration of the currency indicating the origin as Banque de Credit Bujumbura(BCB) to a recipient, Brinks Global Services, Kenya upon arrival. He later provided the same money at the Swissport Cargo shed with different export documents for shipment to Global Services, UK after being cleared by JKIA’s Customs Unit. ''The millions have been held and the matter is being investigated by The Asset Recovery Agency(ASA),'' KRA said. The revenue agency has encouraged all passengers to correctly declare all items at the ports of entry and exit as required under the provisions of the second and third schedules of the EAC Customs Management Act,2004.
