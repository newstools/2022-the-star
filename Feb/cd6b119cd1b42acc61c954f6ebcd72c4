The feud between comedian Eric Omondi and musician Bien of Sauti Sol is far from over after Eric released a parody diss track of Bien's song Mbwe Mbwe. In the cover track Nywee nywee, featuring Aaron Rimbui, he criticises Bien for his baldness. Many people have enjoyed Eric's technique in the song, with how he put his words into the rhythms of Bien's music with unparalleled eloquence. Due to the humor in the video that Eric uploaded to his Instagram page on February 7, many have said the beef is not personal but a way to bring life to the music industry in Kenya. The two have been at loggerheads for more than two months after a scuffle ensued between them at the end of December last year in a concert. Later, Bien accused Eric of stealing his items such as car keys, phone and identification cards.
