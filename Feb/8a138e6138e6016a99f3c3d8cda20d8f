Bungoma county UDA chairman John Waluke has dismissed claims by a section of aspirants that there is zoning in Kenya Kwanza. "If there is any issue concerning UDA in Bungoma, the official communication should come from either one of the UDA MPs, more so me as the chairman. Nobody is given the mandate to hold press conferences to discuss party matters," he said in Bungoma. Waluke said Ford Kenya, ANC and UDA will field candidates and support them to take up seats in the entire country. "We have not agreed with party bosses under Kenya Kwanza that a certain party will field candidates in a certain region," he said. Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa said there are discussions on how the nominations will be held. He assured aspirants not to panic, saying the primaries will be free and fair. "UDA is a national party and it has clearly stipulated guidelines that highlight how the party will hold its nominations and campaigns. Any sentiments and posts on social media platforms that purport to disrespect the party from our opponents should be treated as gossip,” he said. Webuye West MP Dan Wanyama urged aspirants to seek votes from the areas they are contesting instead of targeting to be given a chance to speak during party rallies. "While at Posta grounds rally, we heard some aspirants complaining that they were denied a chance to speak. I want to tell them that speaking during a rally is not being elected. Aspirants should be focused on seeking votes from churches, meetings and funerals in the areas they want to contest," he said. Wanyama is the deputy chairman of UDA party in Bungoma county.
