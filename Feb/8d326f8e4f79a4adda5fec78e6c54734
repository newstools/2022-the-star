Former Kiambu magistrate Brian Khaemba who was suspended for giving former Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu an anticipatory bail has quit despite being reinstated by the Court of Appeal. A three-judge bench had ordered the reinstatement of Khaemba following his suspension. The magistrate had been suspended by the retired Chief Justice David Maraga on June 19, 2019, for gross misconduct. This is after it emerged that while on leave, he issued anticipatory bail to Waititu who faced a Sh588 million graft case. Khaemba entered a consent with the Judicial Service Commission to be paid all his dues from June 14, 2019, to December 31, 2021. And on Wednesday, on his Facebook page, Khaemba said he will not take up the job. “Even though I was reinstated to my position as a Magistrate by the Court of Appeal, I officially and mutually disengaged with my former employer, the Judicial Service Commission,” he said. He thanked the Judiciary of Kenya for allowing him to serve the country as a Magistrate for over a decade. “Indeed, it was a great honour to move through the ranks, more so having joined the institution in the early stages of my legal career. Many thanks to all those judges, magistrates, Kadhis, Judiciary staff, advocates, State Counsels, police and other players in the justice system that I served with,” he wrote. He said the hallmark of his career was when he served as the Secretary-General of the Kenya Magistrates and Judges Association and later on, as the Secretary-General of the East African Magistrates and Judges Association. I'm now ready to seek to serve my country on a different front, God willing. Khaemba has declared he will be running for the Kimilili parliamentary seat, where he is seeking to oust incumbent Didmus Barasa. Khaemba will run on a Ford Kenya ticket while Barasa is running on a UDA ticket
