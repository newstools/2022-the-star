Police in Mandera are pursuing militants who abducted a nurse in Fino, Lafey sub-county, on Friday night. According to a police officer who sought anonymity, the militants struck at around 7: 30  pm and went straight to the houses where the three medical officers lived. They then ordered them to board their vehicle before speeding off. They are said to have crossed the border into Somalia. Initially, they had kidnapped three officers, two locals and a non-local (who is in charge of the fino health centre), but then dropped the two locals before proceeding with the non-local. “Everything happened so fast. We heard gunshots and before we could respond, they had already crossed the border,” said the officer. Lafey sub-county health officer Ali Hassan Abdi said at least 10 armed militants struck the health facility and abducted the non-local identified as Jackson Kabuu. “We are still at the police station with the two nurses who were released. They are recording a statement. We will furnish you with more details later,” Abdi said in a phone interview with the Star. Efforts to get a comment from Northeastern regional commissioner James Kianda were not successful as his phone was switched off. Lafey MP Abdi Mude, while condemning the incident, called on the security apparatus to move with speed and have the medic released from his captors. "I urge the national government to continue working closely with residents in identifying these characters whose sole intention is to wreak havoc in our region and make it look like a very insecure area," Mude said. This is not the first time such an incident is happening in the area. In 2019, two Cuban doctors were abducted but released one and half years later. And in September 2020, Fino chief  Mohamed Bulle was abducted by the militants and taken to Somalia.
