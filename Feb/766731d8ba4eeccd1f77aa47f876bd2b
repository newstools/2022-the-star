In Monday's newspapers many Russian outlets have rejected western accusations of aggression towards Ukraine and have adopted a defiant tone in the face of western sanctions. The popular pro-government daily, Izvestia, carries comments from military commentator Vladislav Shurygin, who claims ongoing army drills with Belarusian forces are "peaceful," but notes they should serve as a warning to the Ukrainian government that its war with Russian backed separatists can't be won through "force". Kommersant, an influential business newspaper, tells its readers that "Moscow does not rule out that Ukraine or some third party is preparing to stage a provocation in Donbas in order to draw Russia into a war". And the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper mocks western countries for their decisions to evacuate citizens and embassy staff over the weekend. "The US and the EU are taking to their heels from Kyiv," it says. "Of course, one tends to immediately recall panic during the evacuation of the American embassy from Saigon besieged by troops of Vietnamese Communists back in 1975 and during the fall of Kabul in 2021." Elsewhere, many outlets have focused on moves in the Russian parliament, the Duma, to call on President Vladimir Putin to recognise the Moscow backed separatist regimes in Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics. While several papers say such a move would show Moscow's "peaceful" intentions, the director general of the Russian Council for International Affairs, Andrei Kortunov, told the Vedomosti newspaper such a move would attract additional western sanctions. "That is why for now it sounds more like a threat in case Ukraine does not implement the Minsk accords, and the West does not exert pressure on Kyiv for them to be implemented," he says.
