Kenya risks having over 10 million Covid vaccine doses expiring and going to waste (see P8). Kenya has received 24.6 million vaccine doses but so far only 13.7 million have been administered. Another four million doses will arrive later this month. Only 6.3 million people are fully vaccinated, and 6.9 million single vaccinated. The Health ministry wants to vaccinate the entire adult population of 27 million by December. The Health ministry is now doing another vaccination drive with some success but there is still misguided vaccine hesitancy or resistance in parts of the population. The risks of not being vaccinated are far greater than the risk of any vaccine side effect. In the UK, 90 percent of those in hospital with Covid are unvaccinated because vaccinated people are less likely to catch Covid and, if they do, the symptoms are much milder. So, if you are unvaccinated, ask yourself if you want to go to hospital with Covid, rack up a big hospital bill, and possibly die. If you want to avoid that, go and get vaccinated at any health centre. The Covid vaccines are free and safe. Quote of the day: "Time makes more converts than reason."
