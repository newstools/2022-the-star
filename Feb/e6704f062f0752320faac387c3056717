Comedian Eric Omondi has opened up about one of the biggest publicity stunts he ever did as an entertainer. During an interview with Wasafi TV, Eric was remorseful at having erected a billboard for his former girlfriend, Chantal Grazioli. He said the billboard cost him a lot of money but Chantal dumped him after that public declaration. "I bought a car, put up so many billboards and I was still dumped. I did everything," he said. "Nikikumbuka hio story ya billboard inaniuma sana roho, ilinicost sana. Kutoka siku hiyo, naogopa mapenzi sana." He said the experience had really affected the way he sees love and that he is still traumatised. Asked who is better between Diamond and Harmonize, he said, "Let us stop comparing a father and a son, we can only compare Harmonize with Zuchu and Rayvanny, not Diamond."
