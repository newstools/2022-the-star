Dustin Johnson confirmed his commitment to the PGA Tour on Sunday, and fellow golfer Bryson DeChambeau joined him with his own statement later in the day, putting to bed rumours either might jump to the Saudi-backed Super Golf League. Johnson, a two-time major champion and 24-time tour winner, released a statement through the PGA Tour. "Over the past several months, there has been a great deal of speculation about an alternative tour; much of which seems to have included me and my future in professional golf," read the statement. "I feel it is now time to put such speculation to rest. I am fully committed to the PGA Tour. I am grateful for the opportunity to play on the best tour in the world and for all it has provided me and my family. While there will always be areas where our tour can improve and evolve, I am thankful for our leadership and the many sponsors who make the PGA Tour golf's premier tour." DeChambeau, an eight-time tour winner (including the 2020 U.S. Open), released his own statement on Twitter later Sunday. "While there has been a lot of speculation surrounding my support for another tour, I want to make it very clear that as long as the best players in the world are playing the PGA Tour, so will I. As of now, I am focused on getting myself healthy and competing again soon. I appreciate all the support." Johnson, 37, and DeChambeau, 28, join a growing list of top players who have said they are not leaving the PGA Tour, including Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Collin Morikawa, Brooks Koepka, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas. Phil Mickelson is the most notable golfer remaining rumored to be considering a move to the new tour, which has received a $300 million investment from Greg Norman's LIV Golf Investments and has the backing of the Saudi Arabian government.
