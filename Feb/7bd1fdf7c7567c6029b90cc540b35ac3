When it comes to pizza, chicken is a top tier topping that you can never go wrong with. Ingredients 1 ¾ cups self-rising flour (220 g) 1 cup Greek yoghurt (245 g) ½ cup pizza sauce (130 g) 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (100 g), part-skim Boiled chicken cut in cubes, for topping Preparation Step 1 Preheat oven to 200°C Step 2 In a large bowl, mix the self-rising flour and Greek yoghurt until it comes together to form a ball. Step 3 Transfer the dough ball to a lightly floured work surface and use your hands to begin flattening and shaping the dough into about a 12-inch (30 cm) round. If the dough begins to stick, sprinkle on more flour a bit. Step 4 Carefully transfer the dough to a lightly floured baking sheet. Spread the sauce evenly across the dough, sprinkle on the cheese, and top with cut chicken cubes. You can add desired toppings like shredded green pepper or beef. Step 5 Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese, has melted and the crust has turned golden brown. Step 6 Slice and serve with a cold drink. Enjoy!
