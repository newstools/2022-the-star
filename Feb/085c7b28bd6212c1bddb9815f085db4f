Deputy President William Ruto will on Tuesday take his campaigns to Kakamega, as his three-day charm offensive of Western region comes to an end. Ruto will be accompanied by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula among other elected and aspiring leaders from the county. The DP will be hosted in the county by Kakamega senator Cleophas Malala. During the campaign, Ruto is expected to make at least seven stopovers where he will address area residents. The towns he will visit include; Likuyani, Lugari, Lumakando market, Khayega market, Kwisero market, Sabatia-Butere and Mumias. The Kakamega tour will bring to a close the second in command's three-day visit of the region that began on Sunday with Mudavadi's home coming in Vihiga and Busia on Monday. Ruto has been working to woo the Western region to back him as he seeks to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 9.
