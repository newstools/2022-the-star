Saku MP Dido Ali Raso has appealed to the residents to shun negative ethnicity and work together towards peaceful coexistence and growth. He said the journey to achieve a prosperous community begins with accepting the need for peace and preaching harmony. While condemning the killing of two people in separate incidents, the lawmaker maintained that a peaceful and secure environment is critical to economic and social development. "It is paramount to advocate for peace and observe the spirit of the unity," said Raso. In a consultative meeting with residents in Saku he urged them to support the Deputy President William Ruto's presidential bid. Raso declared that no amounts of threats and intimidation will stop him from supporting Ruto. The MP said he will defend his seat on a UDA ticket. Raso will be seeking for a third term. He said Ruto stood with Saku people by helping them in fundraisers and now the residents need to back him. Qabale Tache, a resident in Saku said the decision by lawmaker to stick with UDA is highly welcomed. She hailed the MP for his support in uplifting education standards, saying hundreds of young people in Saku are beneficiaries of his initiatives.
