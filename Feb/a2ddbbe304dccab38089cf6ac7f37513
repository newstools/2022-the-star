The Auditor General will no longer audit the accounts of political parties even if they have received public funds (see P8). This year political parties are scheduled to receive nearly Sh2 billion from the Treasury. The new Political Parties (Amendment) Bill 2021 that has just become law deletes from the Political Parties Act 2011 the clause, “The accounts of every political party shall be audited annually by the Auditor-General and shall be submitted to the Registrar and tabled in the National Assembly.” Moreover MPs have lowered the threshold for the number of seats that political parties need to qualify for financial support. This is fundamentally wrong. Political parties are still required to keep books of accounts but they can now be doctored since they will not be strictly audited. In principle, the Auditor General should check on how any, and all, public funds are used. But, equally importantly, we need to know who else is funding political parties and where that money is coming from. Is it coming from supporters, leaders, organised crime, or a foreign government? Without publicly audited party accounts, financial integrity is no longer required in politics.
