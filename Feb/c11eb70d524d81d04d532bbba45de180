The Federation of Kenya Employers and the Labour ministry are not keen on the Employment Amendment Bill 2021. The Bill will stop employers from contacting staff by email or phone outside working hours, or at least staff will be entitled to 'disconnect'. The Bill copies recent European legislation seeking to help workers to maintain a healthy work-life balance. But Kenya is not Europe and it is not clear that this legislation is needed here. There are many legitimate reasons why an employer might want to contact a worker who is off duty and those enquiries would not be a big drain on a worker's free time. The problem in Europe is that it is highly digitally connected and many people now work from home. The EU wants to ensure that digital workers are not forced to labour at the weekend and in the evenings, or outside their stipulated working hours. However if this legislation is passed, there is a risk that employees will become uncontactable when out of the office or factory. That might make Kenya less efficient and productive, to the disadvantage of both employer and employee.
