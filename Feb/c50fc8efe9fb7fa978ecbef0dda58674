Hired goons have demolished the venue for today's Kenya Kwanza Alliance meeting in Kilifi. The meeting is to be addressed by Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. Kilifi North MP Owen Baya blamed Governor Amason Kingi for intimidating other political leaders planning to hold political rallies in the county. All parties involved have been summoned to the Deputy County Commissioner's office to settle the matter Pamoja African Alliance party youth leader Samir Nyundo on Thursday oversaw the dismantling of the venue claiming it was mounted on his family land. Jonathan Nyundo, a relative to Samir, permitted the use of the ground. Jonathan lives next to the ground where the rally is to take place.
