Kitui South MP Rachael Nyamai has thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for appointing her as the Jubilee party deputy director of election, in changes during the delegates meeting on Saturday. Nyamai will deputies Kanini Kega, the director of elections. The MP said she was humbled. “On behalf of the people of Kitui South, the Kamba community and the Jubilee adherents at large, I thank the President for trusting me, to help oversee Jubilee elections across the country,” Nyamai said in a statement. She called for unity of purpose among leaders and especially those from the Ukambani region of Machakos, Kitui and Makueni. “We have to cultivate a sense of unity now that President Kenyatta has brought us together and the Azimio la Umoja umbrella and have our people in government,” the MP said. Nyamai said she was humbling herself to make the unity call so that the people of Ukambani would troop into government. She called on the leaders to tone down bad-mouthing each other. A week ago Nyamai became the second Kitui politician to declare she will defend her seat on the Jubilee party ticket during the August 9 election. The other Jubilee MP, Nimrod Mbai, of Kitui East has since defected to DP William Ruto’s UDA Last month, Former Mwingi North MP John Munuve said he will seek to reclaim the seat he lost in 2017 on Jubilee. When she hosted Jubilee followers at a rural home on Sunday but one, Nyamai affirmed the indispensable affinity with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Jubilee. Her guests had urged her to stick with and seek re-election on the Jubilee party ticket. In 2013 Nyamai was initially elected MP on Governor Charity Ngilu’s Narc party but in 2017 she switched camp and opted for Jubilee as her re-election vehicle. She reclaimed her seat.
