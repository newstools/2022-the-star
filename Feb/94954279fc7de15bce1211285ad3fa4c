Raila began his tour of the region with Kilifi on Saturday and Mombasa on Sunday. The four-day tour ends on Tuesday with a visit to Taita Taveta county. DP Ruto will also proceed with his tour of Meru county, which started on Sunday. Ruto has been in the region since Saturday. On Monday, he will visit Kemu, North Imenti and Tigania West and East constituencies. He has been selling his bottom-up agenda to area residents alongside his Kenya Kwanza coalition partners, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya).
