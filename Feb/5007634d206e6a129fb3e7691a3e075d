The first explosions were heard here in Kyiv shortly after five in the morning. There were four or five, muffled and distant. Others followed soon afterwards, the most recent sounded closer but still not in the city centre. One report suggested the airport might be under attack. A government official dealing with the foreign press said airfields and military headquarters had been attacked. Other reports have been coming in from across Ukraine, including towns in the east, like Kramatorsk, close to areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Coming shortly after Vladimir Putin’s latest speech, this appears to mark the start of Russia’s long-awaited attack.
