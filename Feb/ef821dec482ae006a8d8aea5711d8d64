Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday visited Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria at a Dubai hospital where he is nursing injuries he sustained on his feet. The MP sustained third-degree burns on his feet leading to his hospitalisation for months. Kuria took to his Facebook page to reveal that the country's second in command was in Dubai where he also paid him a courtesy call. "Today I was visited by H.E the Deputy President William Ruto and Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi in Dubai," he said. According to Kuria, he used the visit to update the DP on his recovery journey and also welcome him to his homecoming scheduled for February 19. "I updated them on my recovery progress and formally invited them to join me and all Kenyans during the February 19th thanksgiving prayer day in Thika," he said. The statement by Kuria addressed lots of concerns that had piled up about the DP who has been missing in action in the last few days. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance rallies have been led by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula. The DP is expected back in the country soon to continue with his campaigns across the country.
