Transport Chief Administrative Secretary Chris Obure has quit his post to run for the Kisii governor seat. The former Cabinet Minister resigned on Wednesday morning and declared he wants to succeed Governor James Ongwae. Ongwae is retiring after serving his mandatory two-five year constitutional terms. Obure said he is best suited to become Kisii's second governor given his immense experience in the public service. "In 2013, we wanted a governor to put systems in place, I believe Ongwae has done that and what Kisii wants now is a manager," Obure said at a press briefing at his office. Obure was Kisii's pioneer senator between 2013-2017 and was instrumental in ODM's campaigns in the region. He lost in 2017 when he tried to challenge Ongwae for the Kisii governor's seat.
