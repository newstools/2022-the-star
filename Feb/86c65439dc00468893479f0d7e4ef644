Education CS George Magoha has assured teachers, parents and learners of a smooth transition as the country head to the August 9, elections. Magoha said the looming change of government should not be a cause of worry for anybody and that they will ensure all is set for continuity of learning activities after polls. “Our not being there individually is not important, the important thing is we will be leaving a government which is fully prepared for our children,” Magoha said. This he said while emphasizing the need to train teachers for the Competency-Based Curriculum. He was speaking on Wednesday in Nyeri County where he said Grade 7 and 8 teachers will be trained by April. “There has been a lot of noise about grade 7 teachers, that we are building classrooms where are the teachers,” Magoha said. The CS was commissioning CBC classrooms at Bishop Gatimu Ngándu high school in Nyeri County. Magoha said the trained teachers will be ready to receive learners in the pioneer CBC cohort. “I would like to tell Kenyans that in April of this year, we shall not only train grade 7 teachers, we shall also train teachers in grade 8,” he said. Teachers in primary schools and part of secondary schools are set to continue receiving training on the Competency-Based Curriculum. From 2019 to June 2021, a total of 229,000 teachers received curriculum training. By April this year, the commission targets to train at least 94,000 teachers. School administrators trained on the curriculum by February this year are 23,293. The construction of classrooms meant to host junior secondary learners is set for completion before the national examinations. According to the education calendar, the 2021 KCPE exam will be done between March 7 and 10. Learners will sit KCSE between March 11 and April 1.
