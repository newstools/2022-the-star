Commonwealth Games 20km walk bronze medalist, Samuel Gathimba can not wait for the World Race Walking Team Challenge scheduled for  April 4-5 in Oman. Gathimba, who is the 2019 All Africa Games 20km walk champion, said he wants to use the Oman event as a springboard for both World Championships in Oregon and the Commonwealth Games. The two-time Africa 20km walk champion said Oman is an opportunity for Kenyan athletes to qualify for both the Commonwealth Games and World Championships later this year. “This is a great opportunity for Kenyan walkers to attain qualifying marks,” said former All Africa Games 20km race walk silver medalist. He said  Kenyan athletes have failed to compete at the Olympic Games and other major events due to a lack of top-level competition with international judges. “For us to compete at the major world events, we must compete in international events with top-level judges. This is an opportunity and we don’t want to repeat the same mistake that happened a year ago," he noted. Gathimba won the Africa championships title in 2016 and defended it in 2018. He is currently training in the Aberdare Hills in Nyeri. “My training has been going on well here and I am ready for the Oman event. My training in Aberdares is shaping up very well and I am hopeful ahead of the Oman event,” said Gathimba. Gathimba is expected to face off with Africa Under-20 10,000m champion Samson Dominic Ndigiti and Simeon Wachira in the 20km race while World Under 20, 10,000m champion Heristone Wanyonyi will compete in junior ranks (10km). Former national champion Erick Shikuku will represent Kenya in the Masters' category while Emily Ngii is the only lady in the team and will be competing in the 20km distance.
