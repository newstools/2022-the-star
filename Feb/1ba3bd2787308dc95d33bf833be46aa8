Several Kenyans are now stuck at border points as they try to flee Ukraine following the ongoing unrest. According to Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visa restrictions have left many stranded particularly in Poland boarders. The government has requested all the countries neighboring Ukraine within the EU to allow Kenyans to transit through their borders should they wish to return home. EU Member States bordering Ukraine have agreed to open their borders to Kenyans stuck in Ukraine to allow free passage following negotiations with Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Amb Macharia Kamau. In a statement on Monday, the Foreign Affairs ministry advised Kenyans in Ukraine to take necessary precaution or make arrangements to leave as they deem fit in light of their own circumstances. All the 201 confirmed Kenyans in Ukraine, 18 permanent residents and 183 students were reported to be safe as of Monday morning. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its mission in Vienna issued a cautionary advisory note to all Kenyan’s in Ukraine on February 23. African students stuck in Ukraine are now seeking refuge or escape routes following Russian invasion last week. What was meant to be a cheaper alternative to studying in Western Europe or the United States has turned overnight into a war zone as Russian tanks, planes and ships launch the biggest European invasion of another nation since World War Two. With flights grounded, African governments thousands of miles away are struggling to support their students. The students say they have had no help from home. Edited by B. Oruta
