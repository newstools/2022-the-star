Baringo's  Ismael Kurui recovered from a disappointing National Cross Country Championship outing  to claim first place in the 6km under 18 boys' race at the Agnes Tirop Memorial World Cross Country Tour. Kurui  clocked 18:15 as Vincent Maiyo (18:16) and national defending champion Charles Rotich (18:21) finished second and third respectively in the closely-contested race at Lobo village in Eldoret. He admitted he had to pull up his socks after the disappointment at the same venue over a fortnight ago. "At the national championship, I slipped and fell and so could not finish the race. I had to go back to the drawing board and work hard to prepare myself for today's competition. I won at the Discovery Cross Country Championship and I am happy that I carried the same form to today," Kurui said. The Torongo camp athlete added: "I was so heartbroken when I pulled out of the national championship but today am rejoicing. Nonetheless, the course today was a lot tougher than it was last time...I guess it is because it felt a bit colder than it was when I last competed here." He has now set his sights on the World Under-20 Championship in Cali, Colombia in July this year and said he will work hard to secure his place on the plane to South America. "My dream is to now represent the country at the upcoming World Under-20, specifically in the 3000m. I want to work hard towards the same and so, there will be minimal time to rest because the trials are not that far," he said. In an earlier race, Joyline Chepkemoi clocked 18:05 to cut the tape in the under 18 girls' 5km race, ahead of Maureen Jepkoech (18:14) and national champion in the same race category, Pamela Kosgei (18:26) in second and third respectively. Chepkemoi, who hones her craft at Lemotit camp in Kericho, described the win as unbelievable. "It was an unexpected win for me because it was a tough race today. I want to thank God for this victory," she said.
