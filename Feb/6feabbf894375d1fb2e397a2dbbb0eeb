Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga's ODM party has formally ratified the decision to join Azimio la Umoja Movement. Azimio is Raila's 2022 presidential vehicle. ODM's top decision-making organ - National Governing Convention (NDC) - on Friday overwhelmingly endorsed the decision during a meeting at the Bomas of Kenya. President Uhuru Kenyatta's Jubilee Party and ODM are the anchor parties of the fledgling coalition. Suna East MP Junet Mohammed said the coalition will be officially launched in two weeks’ time. ODM top decision-making organ also cleared its party leader Raila Odinga as the sole presidential candidate in the August polls. National Governing Convention members made the decision which will on Saturday be ratified by the Party's NDC at Kasarani gymnasium. Raila's candidature was proposed by his deputy Wycliffe Oparanya and seconded by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho. The two who had also expressed interest to fly the party's flag withdrew their candidature and agreed to rally behind the former PM as the only candidate. "I wanted to be president and made an application to fly the flag, however, after studying the prevailing circumstances, I am formally withdrawing my bid today," Oparanya said. Joho while withdrawing his candidature said this election is Raila's moment.
