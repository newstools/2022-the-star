Nairobi County Government is set to introduce a service fee between Sh20 and Sh200 for vehicles and boda bodas to access the newly constructed bus terminals. This is among the new charges contained in the Nairobi City County Finance Bill, 2021, that was passed by the Nairobi County Assembly on Tuesday. In the bill tabled by the Finance, Budget and Appropriations  Committee, boda boda operators will be charged a minimum fee of  Sh20 to access the termini. Taxis, Saloon cars and Public Service Vehicles (PSV) carrying up to 13 passengers will be charged Sh50 per entry. A 42 matatu seater will be required to pay Sh100 while 43 seaters and above will part with Sh200 per entry at the termini. GreenPark terminus is among six other termini the Nairobi Metropolitan Services is setting up at a cost of Sh350 million that will officially be pick up and drop off points once matatus are barred from the CBD. The others include Desai, Park Road, Ladhies-Muthurwa, Fig Tree terminus and Bunyala-Workshop Road. Bunyala -Workshop road termini will be reserved for matatus plying Mombasa Road, South B, South C, Industrial Area, Imara Daima, Athi River, Kitengela and Machakos routes. All matatus currently using Tea Room and Accra Road plying the Thika Superhighway and long-distance matatus from Mt Kenya will move to Desai and Park Road termini in Ngara. The terminus at Muthurwa-Ladhies will handle matatus from Jogoo and Lusaka roads. Motorists parking their cars in Nairobi’s Central Business District ( Zone 1) will still pay Sh200 for parking fees after MCAs rejected the proposed Sh400. An attempt to introduce similar charges in the  Financial Year 2019-2020 was halted after the Consumer Federation of Kenya (Cofek) went to court and successfully obtained a suspension of the levies, reverting the fees to a flat rate of Sh20 The same parking fees will be applied for Zone II, covering Westlands, Yaya Centre, Upper Hill, Community, Ngara, Highridge, Industrial area, Gigiri, Kilimani, Milimani, Hurlingham, Lavington, Karen and Eastleigh and not the proposed Sh300. Parking in Zone III, which include all areas that are not in Zone I and II or residential areas not included in the CBD and other zones, will attract a fee of Sh100 while those in Zone IV, which include areas bordering other counties will part with Sh50. Another relief to motorists as sticker fees have also been slashed with for a month’s season ticket will cost Sh4,000 from Sh7,000, while the three-month stickers will cost Sh10,000, down from Sh18,000. For a six-month sticker, motorists will be charged  Sh20,000, a reduction of Sh12,000, while an annual sticker will cost Sh35,000, down from Sh55,000. “In this regard, it shall cost no more Sh4,000 to acquire a monthly seasonal parking ticket for a private saloon car, down from the proposed Sh7,000, while daily parking fee within the CBD shall be Sh200 and Sh100 in all other business zones,” Mbatia added. Seasonal tickets paid through registered Sacco, matatu with a carrying capacity of 1-13 passengers will be required to pay a monthly fee of Sh500 or Sh2,800 for half a year or Sh5,000 annually. For Minibuses (14-42 seater), the matatus have an option of paying a monthly fee of Sh800, Sh4,000 for half a year and Sh7,500 annually. Buses with a carrying capacity of 43 passengers and above will part with Sh1,000 monthly or Sh5,000 half-year or Sh9,000 annually. Using parking slots for offloading only will attract a daily fee of Sh300  for pickup ( between 3-5 tons) and lorries with over 5 tons will be required to pay Sh500. However, the county has maintained a towing fee of Sh1,000 for all vehicles. “The committee has proposed that the maximum fee chargeable for towing be Sh1,000 thereby reducing the hue and cry which has been associated with the exorbitant towing charges imposed by the county,” committee chairperson Robert Mbatia said. The amended levies will take effect immediately after Governor Ann Kananu assents to the bill or after 14 days of the publication of the bill in the Kenya Gazette.
