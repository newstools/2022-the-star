Nairobi City Star goalkeeper Stephen Njunge believes the Kenya Premier League is within their sights. He is, however, urging his teammates to concentrate a little more even though results so far have left the team in good stead. With 18 games into the 34-game season, Simba wa Nairobi sit second on the log with 32-points, five adrift off leaders Kakamega Homeboyz. “Compared to last season, we’ve had a much-improved season. It’s been a good season so far,” said the soft-spoken shot-stopper “Even then we need to learn to finish off our games early, I ask for improved concentration, which will improve our results and give us a better chance to gun for the title.” In the 2020/21 FKF Premier League season, Njunge was the only City Stars player to feature in all 33 games. He clocked the full 2,970 minutes and registered 11 clean sheets that earned him a runner-up goalkeeper of the year award, which was accompanied by a Sh300,000 bounty. His sentiments were echoed by midfield kingpin Peter 'Pinchez' Opiyo, who revealed that the winning feeling is in the ranks of Nairobi City Stars. According to the passer per excellence, Simba wa Naiobi is at a good place, and can even scale higher should the team avoid dropping off points that are deemed collectible. “I must say that so far we’ve had a decent season and it can only get better,” said Pinchez. “Team chemistry is perfect and it’s a great plus to us. We approach all games with a winning mentality. I must say it going on well for us and we can only make it better.”
