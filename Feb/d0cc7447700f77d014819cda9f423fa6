A  woman accused of strangling her husband to death during a fight has been sentenced to 14 years in prison. Maureen Chebet was convicted after she admitted to a lesser charge of manslaughter. She was accused of killing Elias Kipchirchir Yego by strangulation on February 17, 2018, in Kapsabet, Nandi county. In a judgment delivered by justice Reuben Nyakundi on February 3, the court considered the accused's admission of  guilt, sentencing her to 15 years. But the court noted that  the  accused   was  in  custody  from  March 8,  2018,  to  date. The court could deduct three years and 10 months spent in pre-trial custody in accordance with Section  333(2) of  the Criminal  Procedure  Code. He said the offence was great and there could be no mitigating factors, so he only reduced the sentenced to 14 years. She said there could be no aggravating factors that outweigh any mitigation and sentenced her to 14 years. Chebet entered  into  a  plea  bargain  agreement  dated  February 2,  2020. The  plea  bargain  agreement  recommended  she be charged with manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years. The  court heard that Chebet was cohabiting  with  the victim and their quarrels often attracted the attention of neighbours. On the day of he quarrel, the two had struggled and the accused strangled him to death. In  mitigation, Chebet said she was remorseful and a mother of four, including one child sired by the man she would later kill. “This  court  finds  that  the  accused   must  be  made  to  take  full  responsibility  for  her  actions.  The  accused   must  learn  how  to  tame  her  emotions  to  avoid  inflicting  harm  on  others,” the judge said.
