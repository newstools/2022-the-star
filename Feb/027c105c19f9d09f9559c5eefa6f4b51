South African singer-songwriter Pilani Bubu has released 'Lockdown Lovestory', a song she says was written and recorded at the height of the pandemic. She said it is inspired by the journey she takes in a long-distance and virtual relationship. "It is all about exploring the nuances of the loneliness and yearning presented by this circumstance." Pilani explores the feelings of fantasy and nostalgia packaged in Nu-RnB, she makes references to 90s teen nostalgia in the music production as well as the visual storytelling. She collaborated with Afronautiq; Sean Peevers on the springboard track ‘As We Lay’ that began the production journey of the project. Then she worked with beatmakers and producers Samuel ’Sichangi’ Namasaka (Kenya), Ludwe Danxa (South Africa), Andras Weil (Budapest) and guitarist Bradley Prince (South Africa).
