Eastern Region chairman Ainsworth Maragara expects athletes to feel at home in the new tartan track at Kimuvia Stadium, Tharaka Nithi during the third leg of the Athletics Kenya Track and Field Weekend Meeting on March 5. Maragara said they are delighted and privileged to host such a big delegation of athletes in a long time, especially at the newly built tartan track. “As a region, we are happy that we are hosting this event will be on a tartan track for the first time ever in this region. And it will be the first time the Tharaka Nithi county will be hosting an event of such magnitude,”  Maragara said. Organisers had initially slated the penultimate leg of the track and field series for Embu University but opted for Tharaka Nithi to enable athletes to get a feel of the new tartan, which is standard. “We were to host the championships in Embu but we moved because we did not have a tartan track of this calibre. At the same time, the two counties are neighbours. It's about 30km from Embu to Chuka, meaning not much time will be wasted,” Maragara said. He said: “Many athletes hoping to compete at the Commonwealth Games and the World Championships can use this track as part of their training before the national championships. With such facilities, we really need to utilize it very well because it is the only one in the whole of the region." He assured stakeholders of a successful event without any hitches during the two-day championships. “Since we are expecting a big crowd of runners, we have put in place good measures to ensure they enjoy the championships. We will ensure they have humble time for them to compete successfully,” he said.
