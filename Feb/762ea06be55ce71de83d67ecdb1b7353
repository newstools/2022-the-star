Golden milk, also known as haldi doodh in Hindi is rich turmeric milk that is made by mixing animal or plant milk with turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, and a sweetener of choice. Some people also include black pepper, nutmeg, or other spices in their preparation. The drink not only looks but also tastes just as heavenly as it sounds. It’s also a delicious way of enjoying the immunity-boosting effects of turmeric and ginger, as the two are antioxidant-laden roots. Note: For a natural flavour and maximum benefits prepare the drink with freshly-grated turmeric and ginger root instead of store-bought. Ingredients 1/4 cup grated ginger 1/4 cup grated turmeric root 1 tsp cinnamon 1/4 cup coconut oil 1/4 cup honey 5 cups milk 5-6 whole black peppercorns 1 tsp cardamom powder Method Place the turmeric and ginger gratings in a small food processor, add the coconut oil and peppercorns then grind them into a smooth paste. In a cooking pot, add milk then place the pot over medium heat. Once it heats to a lukewarm temperature, add in the ground paste then stir gently. Add in the cinnamon and cardamom powder and continue stirring so that it doesn’t burn or boil. Reduce the heat to low and allow it to simmer, stirring often, for 5 to 10 minutes or until nicely golden. Remove the mixture from the heat and stir in honey to taste, until it is dissolved. Cover the pot with a lid and let it sit for 5 minutes for the flavours to steep. Strain the golden milk using a mesh sieve into a jug then serve and enjoy warm.
