Nigerian gospel sensation Onos Ariyo has released her fifth album, New Dimension, across all digital platforms. The album features 14 tracks intentionally curated to bless her fans. The new studio album features fellow Nigerians Ada Ehi, Victoria Orenze and Oluchi as well as Dena Mwana from Congo. Onos said she worked privately on the album. "I've been less than honest about what I've really been up to lately," she said. "For the last year, I've been secretly working non-stop on this album, hosting IG live with great people around me, which I am happy to say is finished, and frankly will speak to many of my fans across the globe." She is set to embark on a global tour that will include Nairobi.
