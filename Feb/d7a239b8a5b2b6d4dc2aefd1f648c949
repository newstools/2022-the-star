The Directorate of Criminal Investigations has considered an application by businessman Jimi Wanjigi seeking to have a 3-day ultimatum issued for the return of firearm extended. In a letter by Kuriah Obadiah, on behalf of DCI boss George Kinoti, Wanjigi has been given four more days to heed the earlier issued directive. "Reference is made to your letter OW/2022/148 dated  February 24, 2022, which I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of. The contents thereof have been noted and after due consideration, the summons is herewith extended for another 96 hours," the letter read. Wanjigi through his lawyer Nelson Osiemo had lamented that the 72 hours given was too short and asked for more time to comply with the directive. "Our client's request for your extension of summons is based on Article 50 (2) (c) that requires one to be accorded a fair trial, which includes the right to have adequate time and facilitate to prepare a defence," Wanjigi said. Wanjigi had been ordered to surrender 10 firearms and over 400 bullets he owns by Wednesday. The businessman is said to be possessing 10 firearms and ammunition illegally. In a letter to the businessman dated February 21, the DCI said they knew of the weapons on January 17, 2022, while at his Kwacha offices in Westlands while conducting an investigation on a land matter in which he is a person of interest. " The criminal investigation has established that you hold 10 firearms of different makes and descriptions which act of possession is in contravention of the law," the letter reads in part. The DCI said Wanjigi has no certificate authorising him to own such weapons.
