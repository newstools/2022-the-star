The Kenya Urban Roads Authority has now revealed that a section of the road along Ngong Road was opened due to public pressure despite it not being completed. This is after the public raised concerns over Sunday's road accident that left four people dead, including two Canadian in  Dagoretti along the Ngong Road Speaking in his office at Barabara plaza, Kura’s Director-General Silas Kinoti said the road was opened for public use due to public pressure. “ I apologise to the public over the Ngong Road accident that left four people dead. The agency regrets the accident and that it’s not its intention to see people die on the roads,” he said. The four died after the four-wheel-drive car they were travelling in hit a roadside wall before it plunged into a railway track. Two others were injured. The DG noted that staff from the road agency and the contractor have been mobilized and are on-site to rectify the section which has been blamed for many accidents. Nairobi police boss James Mugera said officials are investigating the incident and that the scene was cleared later in the afternoon. Police and witnesses said the car was moving from the Karen direction to the city centre when the driver lost control and plunged into a railway track. The two others who were injured were admitted to a hospital in Nairobi. The incident caused a huge traffic jam on the busy road as officials tried to rescue those trapped in the car for almost three hours. At the moment, Kura is putting up street lights and other safety measures including road signs. "We also urge motorists to take caution since the road is still under construction. There are sections that haven't been marked but soon, the entire road will be complete," he said. Kinoti added that Kura is not just looking at Ngong road alone but all other roads under its jurisdiction.
