A 20-year-old student from Chekalin High School in Kakamega County drowned in the Kipkaren River while on a fishing expedition on Sunday. Divers have begun searching for the body of Victor Aswan, who drowned on Sunday at around 2 pm. According to witnesses, Aswani was on a fishing expedition with his sister when he decided to swim in the swollen river but was overwhelmed by strong waves. "My brother and I came to the river to fish. After some time, he said he wanted to swim, so he jumped into the river, but he drowned," said Vancy, the victim's sister. The residents reported that the body was spotted at around 5 pm on Sunday, but disappeared moments later in the deep waters. The victim's clothes and fish were found on the bank of the river. The incident was reported at Turbo police station. Police said the divers are scouring through the river in an attempt to recover Aswani's body. According to a report by the World Health Organization, an estimated 236,000 people drown every year, and drowning is among the 10 leading causes of death for children and youth aged 1-24 years. More than 90 per cent of drowning cases occur in rivers, lakes, wells, and domestic water storage vessels in low and middle-income countries, with children and adolescents in rural areas being disproportionately affected. All governments, civil society organizations, and individuals are urged to highlight the need for urgent, coordinated, and multisectoral action on proven measures such as installing barriers controlling access to water, teaching people how to swim, water safety, and safe rescue skills. Others include; training bystanders on safe rescue and resuscitation, and improving flood risk management.
