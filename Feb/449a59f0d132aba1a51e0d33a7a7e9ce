Murang'a Woman Rep, Sabina Chege on Thursday stirred controversy when she made remarks that appeared to address vote-rigging claims. While urging residents to register in large numbers as voters so that they can vote in ODM leader Raila Odinga to be the fifth President, Chege ended up saying:  "Kule central nimeskia hapawengine wakisema hapa tuliwaibia, kuna kaukweli kidogo. Lakini mjue kama tulijua kuiba si ata hii tutafanya nini...alafu.. alafu". Loosely translated as, 'In Central, I have heard here some people saying that we stole from them. There is some truth in that. They should know that if we knew how to steal then, why not in this? Will we not do something... then.. then..then". The lawmaker went on to say that ODM Raila Odinga has gained the support of people all over the country who are not afraid to go above and beyond for him. "Wanafikiria hao ndio wajanja, lakini sisi tuko na watu. Na baba ametemba kwa watu na amekua the people's project na tunataka akue the people's president," she said. Loosely translated as: "They think they are clever but we have people. Raila has been people's project and we want him to be people's president".
