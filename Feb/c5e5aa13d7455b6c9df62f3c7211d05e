On Wednesday, WCB lead female star Zuchu cleared the misconception surrounding her relationship with Diamond Platnumz. The rumour advanced to a level where netizens believed that Diamond and Zuchu are actually getting married. In an interview with Wasafi Media, Zuchu said, "I'm happy always. I'm at a happy place." During the show, she got a video call from Diamond. Asked about it she said, "Diamond is my boss. Not lover. He is the boss he has never changed. I'm not lying to you. He is my boss." Adding, "The video call was to confirm that I got here safe for the interview. And yes he always calls on a video call. And he does that to all his artistes not just me." As Wasafi artists, don't you have a WhatsApp group where he can get updates on everything? Zuchu explained, "Yes we do but for this specific interview he had to check up on me because I'm the face of the mega-concert. So he has to make sure that everything is going well." Asked why her mother, Khadija Kopa posted a cryptic message wishing her well on Valentine's Day. Zuchu said, "Inshallah, if that (marriage) ever comes to fruition then I will be glad. But on February 14, I will be headlining a big show." Adding, "For my mother to post what she posted and my friends to follow suit was because they are happy for me. It is also about the significance of the day and how big the show will be."
