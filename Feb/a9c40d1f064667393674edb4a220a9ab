Residents of Seme subcounty in Kisumu have been urged to make use of Kit Mikayi for financial gain. Dr Richard Ayah, a parliamentary aspirant in Seme, said the giant stone has immense benefits which have not been exploited. He said the community around must organise themselves and see how they can tap economic benefits from tourists visiting the rock. Aya said it is time residents ventured into income generating activities like weaving, artistic work, and molding among others for sale to tourists. Speaking during an event at the site, Ayah said both local and international tourists will buy artwork from the area. “When someone visits the site, they should find something to purchase at the entrance so we  should take advantage of this.” He said as an aspirant, he has a vision that will help the community earn money from their work. Ayah said the rock is a magnet with several tourists visiting the site on a daily. He promised to help the elderly, who know the history of the rock, to have the message contained in a booklet which can be sold worldwide.   -Edited by SKanyara
