Diamond's mum Sandrah and Zuchu's mum Khadijah Kopa are allegedly not in good terms despite their children dating. In a report published by Tanzanian bloggers, Sandrah cannot believe her son is dating Zuchu and even her efforts to ask her son to keep off her have borne no fruits. Sources close to the family say Mama Dangote has tried in vain to make her superstar son stop his relationship with Zuchu. She says Zuchu's family might have bewitched her son with black magic. When asked about the beef, Zuchu's mum said, "We are good and we meet and laugh. So, stop creating beef. We are common people who our kids have brought together since they work together." She was asked to call her on-air to clear those allegations but she said she did not have Mama Dangote's phone number.
