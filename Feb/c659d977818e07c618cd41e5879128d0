Ten schools in Mwingi have received books from the Kenya National Library Services. The schools in Ngomeni ward, Mwingi North, received text books, revision and story books. The books were donated on Monday at an event held at Mitamisyi Primary School. Margaret Mbithuka, who works with KNLS Mwingi branch, said they were determined to improve education in Ngomeni ward. She said the ward has been performing poorly in the national exams. "We have noted the poor performance in Ngomeni and that’s why we decided to bring a library closer to the learners. We will also be exchanging the books, after a short period," Mbithuka said. The official said the initiative started by training teachers on how to start libraries in schools. "The exercise will extend to more schools in future with an aim of improving the reading culture," she said The schools benefitted from over 3,000 text books, revision books and  story books. Ngomeni curriculum support officer, Dorcas Muthui while lauding the exercise by KNLS said different stakeholders should also help boost access to education materials. "We lacked enough books thus the poor performance," she said. Muthui however said the donations will be a major boost for the school and student's performance. Gideon Kimaku, headteacher Nzaini Primary School said for a very long time, poor performance has been witnessed in Ngomeni schools. He said the Kenya National Library Service should keep supporting the schools for better results. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
