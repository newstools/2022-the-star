Nairobi City Stars' centre-half Kennedy Onyango is happy with their progress in the 2021/22 FKF Premier League. “So far, so good and I thank God for everything. Personally, I am happy with my performance during the first leg of the season, and I hope to improve in the second leg,” said Onyango City Stars currently sit second in the 18-team log with 31 points garnered from the 17 games played so far. Simba Wa Nairobi is now within three points of Onyango’s immediate former employer, Kakamega Homeboyz. “Collectively as a team, we’ve done well so far but the focus and hunger to achieve our seasons’ targets is still on course till the last game of the season,” said the defender. Out of the 17 games played by City Stars, Onyango has been in the team set up 15 times and has gone on to play  12 matches. On three occasions, he was left on the bench, and once, he came on as a substitute in the second half.  He has completed eleven games. He added: “There’s healthy competition in the team but through our  “Yes We Can” slogan, we’ve really improved as a team.” As he prepares to start the second leg on Sunday against Nzoia, he said: “It’s not over until it’s over and we will keep fighting up to the last game," he noted. Meanwhile, new signing Augustine Kuta is aiming high after arriving at Simba Wa Nairobi from the National Super League side, Kibera Black Stars. Kuta is appreciative of the fact he is back when he thought his career was over after suffering a knee injury while at Western Stima in 2020—his only other workstation in the Premier League. “I join the club with high hopes of winning my first silverware in top-flight football. I am grateful for getting a second chance to play top-flight again,” he said.
