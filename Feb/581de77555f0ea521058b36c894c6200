Kenya Forest Service men's coach Wachira Gatuiria wants Kenya Volleyball Federation to decide on whether the remaining matches will be played indoor or outdoor. More matches have been played outdoor despite the federation promising at the start of the season that 70 percent of their matches would be played indoors. The federation had agreed with Africa Nazarene University to use their hall but so far no matches have been played at the institution. Last week's fixtures at Nyayo Stadium were played under the scorching sun amid complaints from players. Worryingly, the federation is currently using the only two available gymnasiums at Nyayo Stadium and Makande Hall in Mombasa. "The facilities cannot host 16 matches in the men's category if each team were to play two matches like it was the case at Nyayo Stadium. " The current confusion is affecting teams' performance and KVF should come clear on the way forward. Playing indoor today and then outdoor tomorrow is not good for the sport," Gatuiria said. On his part, Trail Blazers assistant coach Richard Sylvain insists matches must be played indoors if the country is to bridge the gap between it and volleyball powerhouses. "Kenyan players struggle to fit into European Leagues because they are used to the outdoor game," he said.
