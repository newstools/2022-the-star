The Directorate of Criminal Investigation women's volleyball coach Daniel Bor believes his charges need more time to gel despite a 3-0 win against Kenya Army on Sunday. The sleuths had on Saturday surrendered 3-0 against Kenya Volleyball Federation league defending champions Kenya Prisons but recovered to disarm Kenya Army 25-12, 25-13, 25-9. While the third leg matches at Kenya Ports Authority KPA's Makande hall was a test of what to expect in the unpredictable season, Bor believes backcourt defence is a priority if DCI are to produce results. "We have good players who can become better if they train well and have a better understanding of each other. Bonding is a must. The result against Prisons is a reflection of what needs to be done," Bor said. "It was a good response beating Kenya Army but the team looked disjointed against the defending champions. We have many new players and the flow of the game was poor, forcing us to switch positions." Mercy Iminza was switched to her middle-blocking position after being played as a right attacker. "We need to tweak the team, work on backcourt defence and we will be good to go. I was impressed with what I saw against Kenya Army. The desire was there and with more matches coming up, I have no doubt we have a crop of players to do the job," added Bor. In another match, Kenya Pipeline made light work of Kenya Defence Forces to win in straight sets of 25-18, 25-21, 25-16. On Saturday, KCB hammered newbies Vihiga County 25-18, 25-21, 25-14.
