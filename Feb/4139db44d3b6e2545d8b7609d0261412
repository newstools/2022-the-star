Former Harambee Stars players led by Musa Otieno and Mike Okoth Origi will this weekend head to Mombasa to curtain raise the Football Kenya Federation Premier League match pitting hosts Bandari and record champions Gor Mahia. The legends will take on their Madiginho counterparts in what promises to be a great day of football. Football Kenya Federation presidential aspirant Twaha Mbarak, who is hosting the legends, says time has come for the former national team players to get proper recognition in the country — having served under difficult conditions in the previous regimes. “We have decided to work with former footballers, whom we believe are the biggest stakeholders in football,” Twaha said. Last month, the Kenyan legends traveled to Uganda and played their counterparts in a series of friendly matches that were aimed at strengthening ties between the two countries. Twaha said: “We supported the legends in their travel to Uganda and we are going to work closely with them and ensure that we bring football back on track.” The Mombasa trip is one of the many engagements the legends will have with the FKF presidential hopeful as the federation’s elections draw closer. Last week, Twaha met Kenya Women Premier League clubs in Nakuru and promised to help each of the 12 clubs comply with the Sports Act. Saturday’s game against Madiginho will kick off at 12:30pm.
