Kericho Golf Club will be a battlefield this weekend as at least 100 golfers tee off on the 9-hole par-72 golf course for the eighth edition of the ongoing Johnnie Walker Golf Series. At stake in this leg of 'Road to Gleneagles' will be a place in the semi-finals — dubbed the Eagles’ Round — set for Muthaiga Golf Club. Kenya Breweries Limited managing director,  John Musunga, expects entertainment galore in the South Rift city as the competition among participants goes a notch higher. "We are delighted to take this series to the Kericho County. Being the eighth event of the series, this has been nothing but an amazing journey for us. The tournament has provided an opportunity for amateur golfers around the country to showcase their talents as it has also offered us the chance to interact with our customers," Musunga said. He expressed the company's excitement at being part of the series of which the last edition was staged at the Eldoret Golf Club on January 29 this year. "Since our establishment one hundred years ago, we have always participated in sports as a means to support the communities where we operate. As we celebrate our centenary milestone this year, we commit to continue supporting sports now and in the future. As we head to Kericho for this event, we are excited and look forward to another amazing golf outing at the scenic golf club," he said. So far, the quartet of Felix Tarus, Peter Maritim, Paul Mwangi, and George Njoroge have joined the list of teams, which have already qualified to the next round. This is after they  jointly scored 114 stableford points to claim first position in Eldoret, ahead of Tom Mutei, James Waweru, Charles Nganga and John Kibosia who carded 113 stableford points. KBL are the sponsors of the tournament, which culminates in a trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland for the winner.
