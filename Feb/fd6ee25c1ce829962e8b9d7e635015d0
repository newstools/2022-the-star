Three-time Kenya Women's Premier League champions Vihiga Queens have suffered a major setback after their top striker Terry Engesha terminated her contract. Engesha, the all-time top scorer at the Vihiga County-sponsored club, confirmed to Star newspaper that she had terminated her contract with the club for reasons she did not explain. "Yes, it is true I have terminated my contract with Vihiga Queens. I am no longer their player," she said. “I am at pains to leave the club that I have played for for over eight years, a club that has been my home but in life, you have to make some tough decision." A source within the club told the Star that Engesha was in talks with an overseas club and that she might fly out any time to play professional football. "Talks with the club are at an advanced stage and she might be leaving the country next week to sign the deal," said the source. Club head coach Bonface Nyamunyamu said the striker had just terminated her contract with the club but she had not informed the team why. “At the moment, we are still in the darkness in regard to where Engesha is heading to,” Nyamunyamu said. Engesha has thanked Queens for nurturing her, saying that the Vihiga County-based club will forever be in her heart. She showered Harambee Starlets coach Alex Alumirah with praises saying she attributes her success to him when he handled Queens. "Coach Alumirah picked me when I was nothing in football circles. For the last nine years, he has shaped me. He has been the best coach in my career," she added. She said she will miss the club and teammates and wished them success in their football careers. First-choice goalkeeper Marcelina Seda has also terminated her contract with the club. "I have terminated my contract and I will hand over any property belonging to the club on Tuesday," she told the Star. Queens are leading the Premier League log with Engesha the top scorer.
