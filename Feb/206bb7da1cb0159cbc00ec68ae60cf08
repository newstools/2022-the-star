President Uhuru Kenyatta will not retire like any other president, Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli has said. Speaking in Mombasa on Monday, Atwoli said Uhuru will become a spokesman. “He is not retiring like other presidents who becomes old after retiring…he will remain somewhere as a spokesperson,” he said. “When Central Kenya lost Jomo Kenyatta, it took them another 20 years to get a leader who is seated right there. He will not disappear. He and Raila will only retire after Raila clinches the presidency.” Atwoli said Uhuru should lead Mt Kenyan as he led them during the Building Bridges Initiative. “Those next to Ruto in Sugoi should cut down all the trees so that he does not commit suicide when Raila wins,” he said. The vote-rich Mt Kenya region has not officially picked any other spokesperson and dismissed those promising to deliver the region to a particular candidate as busybodies. Tycoons from Mt Kenya are seeking to spread their tentacles to influence the country’s politics beyond Uhuru’s backyard. The Mt Kenya Foundation has now trained its eyes on wooing other communities to back Raila's presidential bid.
