ODM leader Raila Odinga’s campaign team has lined up a series of rallies over the next two weeks which will culminate in the Azimio delegates’ conference on March 12 in Nairobi. Raila was on Saturday last week endorsed by ODM delegates as the party’s presidential candidate at the Bomas of Kenya. The Azimio delegates’ conference will be used to pick the movement’s presidential candidate from amongst hopefuls that will be fronted by the other parties that have joined the formation. This, even as all indications point to the ODM leader as the designated Azimio-One Kenya flag bearer following his endorsement by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The two-week campaign streak is largely seen as a precursor to his official unveiling at the conference. The campaign engagements will start on Wednesday in Nakuru County before heading to Kisii and Nyamira counties on Thursday. The convoy will head to Bungoma County on Saturday before crossing over to Machakos County for a series of rallies in Athi River and Mlolongo. All Ukambani governors have joined Azimio and pledged their support for Raila as the movement's presidential candidate. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, a principal in the One Kenya Alliance, has also joined Azimio but fallen short of vouching for a Raila presidency. The Wiper boss is reportedly pushing for a raft of demands, including allowing One Kenya Alliance to negotiate as a team with Azimio. From Machakos, Raila's team will Saturday head to Nyeri County before taking a day’s rest on Monday. Rallies will resume on Tuesday with the campaign team traversing Maralal and Baragoi in Samburu County. On Wednesday, the team will tour Wajir County before wrapping up the campaigns in Raila’s backyard in Kisumu County on Thursday, a day before the March 12 Azimio delegates conference in Nairobi.
