Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has vowed never to succumb to pressure and quit the presidential race on the ODM ticket. Wanjigi said he will not allow any force to thwart his presidential bid. On Sunday, Wanjigi took his campaigns to Homa Bay where he was crowned as a Luo elder at a hotel in Kabondo Kasipul constituency. The businessman argues that he has better chances of winning the presidential seat on August 9. Wanjigi is competing with party leader Raila Odinga who is also eyeing the presidency on the same ticket through the Azimio La Umoja Movement. “I will not bow to any forces that want me to quit the presidential race. I cannot listen to anybody who wants me to drop my ambition,” he said. The businessman told residents that he had good plans for Kenya. He said he will rectify the past in which previous regimes had sidelined Nyanza due to their political stance. Wanjigi promised to undertake numerous campaign rallies in the region. “Raila has no clear path to victory, hence I’m the only one who can give the Orange party victory in the general election,” he added. He asked Raila to support his candidature, adding that he will marshal Mt Kenya people to rally behind him. “We are talking about the destiny of this country. Raila has been my friend for a long time and we have been there for each other. I am committed to serving this country as a president,” Wanjigi said. He said the people of Mt Kenya had rejected Raila in the past elections hence there is no guarantee that they are going to vote for him this time. The businessman argued that he has been welcomed both in Nyanza and Mt Kenya hence he stands a better chance than Raila. “Raila can get Mt Kenya votes through me hence he should support my candidature,” he added. He told Kenyans to focus on leaders who can transform this country’s economy. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
