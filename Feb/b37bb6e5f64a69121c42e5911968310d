Deputy President William Ruto's presidential campaign team on Thursday met the Democratic Republic of Congo's ambassador to Kenya, Malenga Omoy Charlotte in a bid to mend fences. Their meeting followed Ruto's remarks that appeared to suggest that the Democratic Republic of Congo had no cow. The remark caused uproar online. In a tweet, the DP's presidential campaign's communication director Hussein Mohamed said together with the Head of International Relations Ababu Namwamba, the DRC Head of Mission had assured them bilateral relations between the two countries remain unchanged. "DRC Head of Missions Madam Malenga Omoy Charlotte has assured that our bilateral relations remain intact and what takes precedence is the existing formal diplomatic channels of communication," Hussein said. "We both agree that cordial sister countries always leave room for engagement through formal diplomatic channels in the face of any issues." Soon after Ruto's remarks, Congolese Senator Francine Muyumba Nkanga took to her Twitter handle expressing her disappointment with the DP. She termed his remarks as undiplomatic even as she demanded an apology. Ruto apologised and he regretted the misunderstanding that his remarks caused. "I regret any misunderstanding that may have arisen on account of my speech and take this opportunity to assure the government and the people of DRC of my profound admiration and high regard," he said. Ruto said his speech was on a light note to emphasise how the DRC market is big for Kenyan dairy farmers to exploit. "My speech was informal, and my use of certain effects was purely to underscore the magnitude of the opportunity and the urgency of the moment to a local audience. It was not intended to disrespect in any way," Ruto added.
