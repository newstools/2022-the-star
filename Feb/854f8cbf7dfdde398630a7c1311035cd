National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said he has no business fighting other Mt Kenya region parties. "I have no business in fighting other Mt Kenya region parties. Let's channel through one voice, one party. Our interest is better protected by ourselves," he said. Speaking in Lari Constituency, Kiambu county on Thursday while hunting for votes, Muturi said forming Mt. Kenya party is not tribal as everyone has the right of forming a party. "Forming a Mt. Kenya region strong party is not being tribal. You have every right to create a political party, regardless of the region. Other regions like Nyanza, Western, Rift Valley just to mention a few have their own strong party," he said. In a statement on Tuesday, Muturi reiterated that the Mt Kenya region is not only seeking the deputy president slot but also the country's top seat. The presidential aspirant said the region has able leaders who can lead the country. "Those saying that they're looking for a running mate from the mountain should know we can produce the president, and they deputize as well. We're not going to beg anyone to accommodate us," the Speaker tweeted. He added: "My goal is to have a strong party from Mt Kenya".
