Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has denied reports going viral on social media that she bolted out of OKA over a looming deal with Azimio la Umoja. The reports emerged after Oka announced official engagements with the Azimio with an aim of building a grand alliance. One such report quoted her saying: "If One Kenya Alliance joins Azimio, then count me out. That is not part of the deal we signed as OKA principals" In a post on Twitter, the former cabinet minister dismissed the reports terming the "fake". Despite her clarification, questions still linger on her stand regarding the move by OKA to start talks with Azimio. Her absence at the Jubilee and ODM NDC on Saturday has raised eyebrows on her stand in the recent developments pitting Azimio La Umoja and her One Kenya Alliance. On Friday, when Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was addressing the press announcing their entry to Azimio, the Narc Kenya leader was conspicuously missing. UDP party leader Cyrus Jirongo and Kanu's Gideon Moi were present during the press conference. Her silence on the move appears tactical depicting a possibility that she is yet to make her stand to fully join the Azimio La Umoja movement. Wiper leader Kalonzo in his address at the Jubilee NDC, however, downplayed her absence saying she was absent to attend to an important matter. “…Our sister Martha Karua of Narc Kenya is here spiritually with us but she had to get over to Kirinyaga and we bring her greetings to you,” Kalonzo said. Since Kalonzo announced OKA's entry to OKA, the Iron Lady, as she is commonly known, is yet to make a statement approving or denying the motion to join Azimio. Neither has she tweeted or retweeted OKA's statement announcing a move to Azimio, raising doubts whether she approved of the development.
