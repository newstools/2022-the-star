ANC defectors left after failing to secure direct nominations, Musalia's aide has said. Kibisu Kabatesi said they have signed a five-year political contract in the cold. “The so-called exit does not impact ANC either in Vihiga or elsewhere,” he said. “The defectors need ANC more because they rely on it to be re-elected.” Kabatesi said ANC and Ford Kenya are still the strongest parties within Western, they will rule after the August polls. Those who have parted ways with Musalia Mudavadi are Lugari MP Ayub Savula who joined DAP-K as the deputy party leader. While in ANC Savula was serving as the deputy leader, however, he walked out of ANC after Mudavadi agreed to work with UDA. Others include Titus Khamala (Lurambi), MP Godfrey Osotsi (Nominated), Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu), Oku Kaunya (Teso North), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero) and some Western region MCAs. The latest defector is Vihiga Senator George Khaniri who declared support for Azimio la Umoja. “Raila Odinga will clinch the seat and once he gets it we shall be the first beneficiaries,” Khaniri said. “Those heading to Sugoi I wish you the best.” He said Mudavadi's miscalculated political move, will land him into political coldness. Kabatesi said Khaniri, Ososti, Aseka, Kaunya walked out of ANC a long time ago after the general election and they should prepare for their political downfall. He said Khaniri always won elections with the assistance and support of Mudavadi and the Maragoli community as Tiriki rejected him. Kabatesi said Khaniri is not a political factor to be considered in the Western region. He said those who are banking on Khaniri to spoil Vihiga votes are wasting their resources as he won’t bring anything to the table. Mudavadi’s aide said currently ANC is seeking strong candidates who will face off the runaway lawmakers. In Lurambi ANC has identified Stanley Khainga to face off with Titus Khamala on the ballot.
