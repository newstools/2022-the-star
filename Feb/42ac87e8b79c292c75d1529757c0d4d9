ODM leader Raila Odinga on Saturday recounted the events that led to the historic handshake with President Uhuru Kenyatta. Raila said it was not easy for the two of them - who were sworn enemies in 2017 polls - saying it took a lot of sacrifice from both. Speaking during the ODM Delegates Convention meeting at Kasarani indoor arena, Raila said Uhuru ignored his allies who wanted him to have the opposition chief 'hanged' for committing treason. "We know where we have come from, we were in bad shape, Uhuru said we go back to the ballot, but we were uncomfortable with the prevailing situation," Raila said. He added: "As Uhuru was taking his oath at Kasarani, we were headed for a similar ceremony at Jacaranda Grounds but someone disposed sewage on the field halting our plans." The ex-PM said the handshake which brought calm was a godsend and enabled the country move forward. He was speaking at Kasarani during ODM NGC, an event also attended by President Uhuru.
