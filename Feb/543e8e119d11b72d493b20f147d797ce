A court case challenging the implementation of Vihiga budget hurt development projects, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. He said his administration was blocked from accessing funds by the Controller of Budget. Ottichilo’s statement comes after the Controller of Budget's report for the first quarter of the 2021-22 financial year indicated that Vihiga had not absorbed its budget. “Yes, it's true we have not absorbed our development budget but this is because of the situation we were in the first quarter of 2021-22 financial year,” he said. Ottichilo said the court case regarding the budget did not give room for his administration to undertake development projects. “Even those projects we had scaled down were halted due to the budget crisis that I was facing by that time,” he told the Star. “The county was denied access to its funds, so we were unable to do anything. We were not even able to pay salaries at that period.” The petition challenging the budget was filed by former county secretary Francis Ominde and activist James Simekha on the grounds that due process was not adhered to in budget-making. Court orders stopping the county from implementing the 2021-22 budget approved by the county assembly were issued on July 5. But in November last year, Vihiga county finally got its 2021-22 budget approved after the court case collapsed for lack of merit. MCAs approved the Sh6.408 billion budget. Ottichilo told the Star at his home in Emanyinya, Emuhaya subcounty, that it has not been easy for him. During that period of the court case, the county was allowed access to only 30 per cent of its budget for recurrent activities. “We have now been allowed to access our funds, and we have advertised all projects in print media and on our website. We are going to do our best to ensure we recover what we have lost,” he said. Ottichilo urged the youth to apply for jobs via the county website. Edited by A.N
