Migori police are on high alert over rising cases of conmen ripping off residents in the county's major towns. Traders and several residents have reported losing money to conmen who have been selling fake fish feeds and promising huge profits. “We have seen a spike of cases where traders and innocent citizens have lost money over 'wash wash' business in Migori. We have placed a special ring of sleuths to crack open the ring,” Mark Wanjala, the county police commander, said. Wanjala said in most cases traders have been duped to pay huge sums of money and only realise they have made big losses after payments. “The criminals first get wind of traders and people who have huge cash, before they pounce to make a killing. We want residents to keep off get-rich-quick schemes,” Wanjala said. A victim, Chacha Rioba who runs an hotel business in Kegonga town, said he was in Nairobi on January 26 when he received a call from a man who claimed to be a police officer in Ntimaru. “He said he had a business plan that brings huge profits,”Rioba said. When he came to Migori he was told a European trader wanted to buy fish feed smuggled from Tanzania at Sh7,000 each tin. Convinced, Kimono said he withdrew Sh235,000 from his business account and bought six cartoons of the ‘fish feed.’ He said from the transaction he was expecting to earn Sh2,000 per tin, making a total of Sh288,000 in profit. “It was when the 'European trader' failed to come and pick his stock  that I realised I was conned. On opening the cans I found expired beans which had fish food wrappers and the conmen had switched off phones,” Kimwama lamented. Police said they have trailed the phone numbers and realised some were registered to dead people with their last location being in Migori county. There are fears the cases could escalate around the election period as there is flow of money, police have warned.
