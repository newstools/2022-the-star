More youths in Kilifi county are gradually embracing vocational training colleges to gain technical skills. Education executive Rachael Musyoki said the number of students in the VTCs in the county has grown from about 1,600 to 5,400 in the last five years. Speaking during a skills exhibition at Pwani University on Tuesday, Musyoki said many youths used to shun the VTCs due to the perception that they are meant for academic dwarfs. “We had to do a rigorous campaign to change the mindset of our youth. We began by moving from village polytechnics to vocational colleges," Musyoki said. "We also introduced youth-friendly courses and we are still upgrading to more course." She said the county has established hospitality courses and other market-driven courses. “We normally tailor the courses according to the needs of that particular area while, at the same time, giving a thought to the market," she said. "Our colleges are also well equipped and we link the students to major companies for attachment.” Kilifi county has 41 vocational training colleges across the 35 wards. The exhibition was organised by StartUp Africa, a skills exchange organisation. Startup Africa CEO Erastus Mong’are said the aim of the exhibition is to give a platform for the youths to exhibit their products. Mong’are said many youths have great innovations, but lack the appropriate platform to showcase them. “Our aim is to empower them through training and market linkages so that they can show what they do and earn from it," Mong'are said. "We have been doing this through other avenues but we are now partnering with the county governments, starting with Kilifi.” The exhibition brought together youths from Kilifi, Kwale, Tana river, and Taita taveta counties. The schools exchange programme is also in secondary schools where 850 high schools in Kenya have benefitted from the training by StartUp Africa.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
