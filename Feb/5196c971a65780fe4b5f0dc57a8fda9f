Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo's aide and a CEC have resigned to join the Luanda parliamentary and the Woman Representative race. Noah Okaya, who was the liaison officer in the Nairobi office, is seeking the Luanda MP seat. Before that, Okaya served as chief of staff in Ottichilo’s office in Mbale. Environment executive Mary Amalemba has also handed in her resignation as she prepares to contest for Vihiga Woman Rep seat. Amalemba contested for the seat in 2017 as an independent candidate but lost to incumbent Beatrice Adagala. Speaking to the Star on the phone, Amalemba said this year's race will be a do or die contest. “I'm yet to choose the party but I will be working with the Azimio La Umoja movement. I will declare the party in a week’s time,” she said. Okaya is also yet to declare which party he will be using to contest for the Luanda MP seat. Okaya said his aim is to bring change and development in Luanda constituency. “I will not just focus on that Sh120 million at the NG-CDF kitty because with Luanda’s population, then you can’t meet our people’s demand,” he said. “I will source donors from outside so that I am in a position to deliver in education, water and sanitation, environment, electricity supply and health.” Okaya said he has a good network with donors that will help secure funds for development if elected. He said Luanda town is the engine of Vihiga’s economy and it needs to be developed to high standards that will even attract investors across the globe. “Luanda town, and the constituency at large, should have a modern design and setting it to that need funds,” Okaya said. He said Luanda constituency is the economic heartbeat of Vihiga county.
