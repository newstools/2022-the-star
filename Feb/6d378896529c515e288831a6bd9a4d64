A Form Two student at Ndarawetta girls’ secondary school in Bomet central died by suicide after jumping off the rooftop of their classroom Thursday morning. The lifeless body of the 20-year-old was discovered by students who were attending their usual morning preps. They immediately alerted the administration. Bomet central sub-County police Commander Musa Imamai said they received the report about the incident prompting his investigating officers to visit the institution. Imamai said preliminary investigations indicate that the deceased may have been depressed and wanted to end her life. She left a suicide note. He said that she might have waited for the rest of the students to go and sleep the previous night before returning to the class to commit the act. “Our investigation shows that she was disturbed... We found a note inside the locker in her classroom stating that she wanted to meet her God. She also wished her parents and family the best in life,” he said. By the time of going to the press, the school management was yet to comment on the matter. The police boss appealed to parents and teachers to regularly offer counselling to the students to avert such cases. “Let us be close to these children whether in school or at home so that such incidents can be prevented,” he said. Her body was moved to Longisa referral hospital.
