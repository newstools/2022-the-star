Kiambu county has launched a titling programme for all towns and trading centres. Governor James Nyoro said the county has 100 towns which are affected since many of the people who reside in them do not have legal documents to prove ownership. Nyoro said at the end of titling exercise, residents who have never had title deeds will be issued with those documents. The county boss said the process will end perennial land disputes that have affected investments, planning and development in urban areas. “We have seen families embroiled in disputes over land. The most affected are those living in plots in our trading centres. Some had allotment letters and leases,” he said. He spoke at Gikambura trading centre in Kikuyu subcounty on Tuesday during the launch of preparation of title deeds to all allottees in town centres in the county. He was accompanied by National Lands Commission officials led by commissioner Esther Murugi, Lands executive Eunice Macharia and MCAs Henry Kagiri (Kikuyu Town) and Gideon Gachara (Ndeiya), among other county officials. Nyoro said the county will work hand in hand with NLC, subcounty land boards and the county government. He said the exercise will be taking less than one month to complete. Murugi said the challenges faced by NLC during such an exercise was unresolved matters left by land buying companies. She said some grabbed lands were meant for churches, hospitals and schools, among other amenities. Murugi said the exercise was a project launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta to be implemented in all 47 counties to ensure people acquire title deeds of lands they have live in for many years. The objective, she said, was also to get rid of fraud in land acquisition and transfer processes. This would, in turn, end disputes among families and land buying companies, among other challenges affecting Kenyans.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
