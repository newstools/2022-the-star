Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo says there are no cracks in ODM and the party is intact. He said those propagating such narratives are opponents who want to destabilise supporters across the region to gain popularity and to be glorified as the strongest. Ottichilo said missing in the previous Azimio la Umoja campaigns within the region was not a key factor to be considered to say ODM has cracked. “In politics, your opponent will say anything to woo your supporters and we must be careful,” he said. “I am an ODM founder, my political career will end up in the party. Oparanya, our deputy party leader, is leading our presidential campaigns.” The governor spoke Wednesday at Emuhaya CDF offices. He said those in the Azimio brigade should clear the way for Raila who will tour the region soon. He said the party has its structures to be followed and newcomers should comply. “You can’t walk in and start making noise in all corners of someone’s house, sit down and wait for the way forward,” the county boss said. His sentiments come after Vihiga Senator George Khaniri’s camp said they already had the ODM ticket. Otichilo said Khaniri is not loyal to ODM and cannot acquire a ticket to run for the governor seat. “Ever since he joined politics he has been to Kanu, Narc, ODM, UDF, ANC and he is now planning to come back and after the election go elsewhere,” the governor said. “ODM can’t walk away from its loyalists to strangers who can’t be trusted.” Khaniri is eyeing the ODM ticket after failing to secure one from the ANC party. He was locked out by Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi who is eyeing the same ticket under Kenya Kwanza. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
