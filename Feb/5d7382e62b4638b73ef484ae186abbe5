Northeastern regional commissioner James Kianda has urged unvaccinated residents to get inoculated. There has been hesitation by some residents to get vaccinated. Kianda said this had been proved as the best way to fight Covid-19 infections. “There are a lot of stories being peddled about the Covid jab; unfortunately, they are not scientifically proven. This has caused fear among residents,” he said. Kianda spoke Wednesday to the press in Garissa. He said he was looking forward to his first 100 days in office and will work closely with county commissioners, local administrators, clerics and village elders to ensure Covid-19 vaccine uptake goes up. “I am expecting Northeastern to register a mass vaccination target of not less than 100,000 people in the next three months,” he said. “We will work with public health officials from the counties and the health executives to ensure that this is done. I am urging the National Government Administration Officers to ensure eligible residents are vaccinated.” Recently, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe urged county officials to start campaigns in the counties to increase the number of vaccinated residents. Last week, Mandera Health executive Mohamed Adan said the Health Department will hold radio talk shows to educate the community on the vaccine importance. The health executive said the risk of transmission of Covid-19 to unvaccinated persons was still very high. Among the measures put in the place by the county are, all passengers coming in or going out of Mandera will be required to show proof of vaccination. Persons seeking services from government offices will also need to show proof of vaccination. Colleges, prisons and secondary schools are all encouraged to make sure those eligible are vaccinated.
