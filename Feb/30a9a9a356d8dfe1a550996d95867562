The founder of beer brand Cobra has said prices will have to rise because of a "vicious cycle" of cost pressures. Lord Bilimoria told the BBC that "virtually every business in every sector" is being squeezed by inflation, interest rate rises, and tax increases. The Cobra chairman, who is also president of the CBI employers' group, said the picture had become really challenging for firms and consumers. On Sunday, Tesco's chairman warned the worst price rises are yet to come. John Allan told the BBC he expected food price inflation to reach 5 per cent by the spring, hitting the "hardest-up harder". The warnings from two of Britain's most prominent executives come as UK inflation stands at a 30-year high of 5.4 per cent, and it is forecast to top 7 per cent by April.
