Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has urged Nandi Governor Stephen Sang' and his Uasin Gishu counterpart Jackson Mandago to keep off Vihiga politics. He asked the two governors to give the residents room to elect leaders of their choice. The lawmaker said he will continue engaging voters on the ground and convince them why he is the best candidate for the Vihiga senatorial seat. The lawmaker spoke to the Star on phone on Monday morning. "Sang is trying to impose senatorial candidates from Nandi county in order to starve our people," he said. During a funeral service in Hamisi subcounty Sang urged Vihiga residents to elect Jackson Swadi saying he has vast political experience to spur the county's development. Osotsi’s sentiments after Sang and Mandago accused him of disrespecting ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. “Mudavadi is a national leader and he must be respected the likes of Osotsi who are abusing him should be stopped,” Mandago said. Osotsi said the statement made Sang don't scare him at all because his stand against Kenya Kwanza coalition is known. “If they are there to market Kenya Kwanza then they should do so and not peg that alliance to my name to gain popularity,” Osotsi said. “They are attempting to sanitise their unpopular movement using my name. They are targeting me because I am a strong pillar of Azimio who rightly predicted their selfish agenda long before it happened,” Osotsi added. He said Vihiga voters will believe more in his political stand than Kenya Kwanza. The lawmaker said Azimio is still intact in western Kenya.
