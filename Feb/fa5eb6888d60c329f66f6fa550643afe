The Competency-Based Curriculum will not be scrapped, Education CS George Magoha has told critics He said CBC is in its seventh year and in a few weeks will be on the eighth as Grade 6 prepare for Grade 7. Grade 7 is the first year of junior secondary school. Magoha spoke while opening new classrooms at Ingidi Secondary School, Vihiga county. “We won’t allow anybody to take back our kids to KCPE no matter who takes over the presidency,” he said. Magoha said CBC is steering learners away from exam-oriented learning and equipping them with skills that will enable them to prosper in future. He said money pumped into implementing the curriculum would have been wasted if CBC is scrapped. Magoha said they have trained enough teachers for the programme. The CS said the national government is in the process of setting up 10,000 new CBC classrooms countrywide to enable smooth transition. “In Garissa we are at 99 per cent; in Meru, Mandera and Wajir we are at 95 per cent; in Migori and Siaya we are at 87 per cent,” Magoha said. Magoha's remarks come in the wake of threats by Kenya Kwanza Alliance to scrap CBC if they get into power. Kenya Kwanza, while on a tour of Kakamega, Vihiga and Busia counties, said the curriculum is complicated for teachers and parents. Magoha said more than 500 classes have already been opened nationwide. He said their aim is to meet the set target. Only 28 per cent of the works remain in Vihiga county. “The contractors given that work must work with speed to ensure everything is complete before March 7 this year,” Magoha said. The CS said at that moment candidates are sitting their exams but once they are done the ministry will move to the second phase. “We are also doing payments via Safaricom [to ensure] records will remain for future reference,” he said.
