Yote yawezekana bila Ruto...yote yawezekana bila Ruto...! Youths chanted as they met President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday at State House, Nairobi. In a clip circulating on social media, the youths were seen singing and clapping in unison as they said Kenya can move on without Uhuru's second in command. The president hosted thousands of young leaders from across the country at State House to discuss the progress of various government youth empowerment programs. The president was joined by the ICT CS Joe Mucheru. “Yote yawezekana, bila Ruto yote yawezekana bila Ruto (Everything is possible without Ruto).” This comes after the President’s earlier indication that he will support ODM leader Raila Odinga under the Azimio la Umoja Movement in the August 9 election. The meeting comes after the president winded his two-day visit to the coastal area where he launched a number of projects, including the Universal Health Care. Youths are among the majority in the country, and many of them are jobless. They play a big role also in politics, as a number of them are voters who are expected to influence the August election. During his visit to Mombasa, the president said Kenyans need to choose between development-oriented leadership and busybodies. Speaking during the official commissioning of the multi-million-shilling Regional Cancer Treatment Centre at Coast General Teaching and Referral Hospital, President Uhuru said he is interested in the continuity of live-saving projects. “Porojo haimalizi umaskini, porojo haitibu Cancer,” said the head of state. Loosely translated, “empty rhetoric does not eradicate poverty or cure cancer.”
