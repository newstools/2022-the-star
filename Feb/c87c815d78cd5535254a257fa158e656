Struggling Kenyan Premier League club, Mathare United, have appointed John Kamau as their new head coach, following the departure of Ezekiel Akwana a fortnight ago. Kamau will be assisted by Francis Xavier and Julius Mativo. Speaking during the unveiling ceremony, club chief executive officer, Jeckto Obure, heaped praise on the immediate former Wazito assistant coach, describing him as a certified performer. “Mathare United is delighted to announce the appointment of John Kamau as head coach until the end of the season,” said Obure. “Kamau has extremely impressed us with his understanding of the game and above all understanding of the situation that he is coming into. He is determined and understands the task at hand. We are certain that this will be a positive partnership,” added Obure. The seasoned gaffer comes along with a wealth of experience, having held similar roles at Kenyan Premier League clubs Thika United, Posta Rangers, and Wazito. “He has also coached the Kenyan U-20 national team as well as served as an assistant to the Harambee Stars squad that claimed the 2017 Cecafa Senior Challenge title,” added Obure. He will be joined by goalkeeper trainer Samuel Koko who he worked with at Wazito and will be returning to the club after one and a half years. The development comes at a time the Slum Boys are battling to fend off relegation after surviving the axe in the preceding season.
