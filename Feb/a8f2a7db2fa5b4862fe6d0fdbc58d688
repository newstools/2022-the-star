UDA, ANC and Fork Kenya on Thursday took campaigns to Kajiado. The team led by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, UDA chairman Johnson Muthama and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula toured Ilbisil in Kajiado where they spoke of economic liberation. They made several stops where they addressed residents. On one stop, Mudavadi reiterated his plans to create jobs for unemployed Kenyan youth. He also urged Kenyans to be alert to know that Azimio la Umoja is a state project. "These people will lie that they want to pick people from different places across the country to fill up vacant positions of those who have resigned. Do not be deceived," Mudavadi said. "Kajiado is yearning for better leadership. Resuscitating the economy and bringing in new policies that will rebuild our business environment. Kenya Kwanza has the solution, lets support the movement."
