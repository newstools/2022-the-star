Ulinzi Starlets' coach Joseph Mwanza is happy with his charges following their defensive improvement in the ongoing Kenya Women Premier League. He said the team has only conceded twice in the last five matches, describing the run as remarkable. The soldiers' porous defence saw them ship out four goals in the opening two matches of the season. Ulinzi won 6-2 against Kangemi on Matchday One and lost 2-0 to former champions Vihiga Queens. Ulinzi are unbeaten in the last five matches, emerging as the meanest defence over the same period. The Diana Shakava-captained side have scored 13 goals in five matches, propelling Ulinzi to the third position in the 12-team league. A drab 0-0 draw with Wadadia was followed by a 6-0 hammering of Bunyore Starlets. Ulinzi drew 1-1 with Nakuru City Queens, edged out Thika Queens 1-0, and reaped big in the 5-1 thumping of Trans-Nzoia Falcons on Sunday at Ruaraka. "After losing to Vihiga, we had to restructure our backline. The defence gave too much space to opposition attackers and marking was disastrous," Mwanza remarked. "We had to work on closing the gaps, master on zonal marking and I believe it was down to basics and elimination of mistakes. The best way to build the team is to be watertight defensively." At the same time, Mwanza said teen sensation striker Lanoline Aoko has a bright future but challenged her to remain level-headed. The 20-year-old, tasked with filling the void left by Lucy Mukhwana and Neddy Atieno, is living up to the billing after scoring five goals this season. Mwanza predicted that it won't be long before the Nyakach Girls' alumnus gets Harambee Starlets call-up if she continues with her current form. "It is a pleasure coaching her. She's promising and has a bright future ahead of her but needs to continue working hard. I can't rule out her being called for Starlets duty in the future." Ulinzi take on Kisumu All Starlets this weekend.
