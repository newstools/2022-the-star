Deputy President William Ruto enjoys the support of a majority of Mt Kenya MPs' backing him for the presidency. With reports indicating that the DP is likely to pick a running mate from the Mt Kenya region, many of his allies have strategically positioned themselves as potential candidates. Considering the region is rich in votes, Ruto has also kept his Mt Kenya allies close ostensibly to ensure that he does not lose his ground. His Mt Kenya allies comprise those elected on an independent ticket, other parties and a majority of them from the Jubilee party.
