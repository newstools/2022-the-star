Former Law Society of Kenya President Nelson Havi on Saturday said the Western Kenya community has resolved to back Bishop Margaret Wanjiru for the Nairobi governor seat. In a statement with a group of ANC party leaders eyeing elective seats in Nairobi, Havi said the group unequivocally opted for Wanjiru as their preferred candidate for the City's top seat. The ANC party delegates are from the Western Kenya region. Havi said Bishop Wanjiru will not only be a UDA candidate but also the Kenya Kwanza Alliance flagbearer. "As the larger Western Kenya community that votes here in Nairobi, we have unanimously resolved to put our support behind Bishop Margaret Wanjiru for the Candidature of the Governor of Nairobi," Havi said. The lawyer, who is eyeing the Westlands parliamentary seat, said they will campaign as a team for UDA candidates from the presidency to the MCA seats. "We shall, henceforth, work together as we seek the votes of the governor, Senator, MCAs, Woman Rep and for the presidency in tandem with our resolve here today," he added. He openly ignored Senator Johnstone Sakaja as a potential candidate for the Governor seat saying nobody else has expressed interest in the governor seat apart from Bishop Wanjiru. Sakaja defected from Jubilee to ANC  and has already hit the ground campaigning for the Nairobi governor seat. The move signals a looming bitter rivalry given that Sakaja has fashioned himself as one of the Luhya community members. The Nairobi senator is one of the influential ANC members who played a huge role in influencing the entry of Musalia Mudavadi to WilliamRuto's camp. Reports suggest that backing  Mudavadi's candidate for the Nairobi governor seat was part of the agreement that saw the ANC leader team up with Ruto.
