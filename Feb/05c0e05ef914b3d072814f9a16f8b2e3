Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has urged administrators, clergy and politicians to encourage eligible Kenyans to register as voters. He said the turnout in the second phase of enhanced continuous voter registration has been low due to poor civic education. The lawmaker was speaking to the Star on the phone on Tuesday. IEBC officials have decried low turnout of those registering as voters in Vihiga county. Vihiga county IEBC returning officer Jackline Osiemo said they are targeting to register 63,190 new voters. The registration drive started on January 17 and ends this Sunday. By last week, the county had registered 4,909 new voters. According to last week report, Hamisi subcounty topped the list in terms of voter registration with 1,444 voters, Emuhaya was second with 987 new voters, while Vihiga and Sabatia subcounties had 868 new voters and Luanda had 742. This week, the number has increased to 8,251 across the county. “Currently we still have Hamisi subcounty on top with 2,425 new voters, then Emuhaya with 1,647, Vihiga 1,581, Sabatia 1,403 voters and Luanda with 1,195,” Osiemo said. “We are still optimistic that the numbers will increase as time goes," she said. Osiemo said Kenyans always rush at the last minute. She said the county has 295,135 registered voters, but they are optimistic that the number will increase before the close of the second phase of voter listing. Speaking to IEBC field officers across the county, Osiemo said most youth ​​have refused to register, saying most state appointment go to the older people. Alexander Ainea, one of the field officers in Luanda said a number of young people he has approached have refused to register as voters. “The youth are not willing to register as voters and their complaint is that once they have voted in the political class, they do not benefit,” Alexanda said.
