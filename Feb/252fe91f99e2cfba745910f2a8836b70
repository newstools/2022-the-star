The ruling Jubilee party has intensified efforts to revamp itself ahead of the August 9, elections. Kieni MP Kanini Kega on Friday led the Jubilee party team in a consultative meeting in Nyeri county. The meeting brought together party members, locals and aspiring leaders. The meetings were replicated in Mathioya, Gatanga, Kipipiri, Kangema and in Njoro. In all the meetings, the clarion calls were to rally locals behind the party and ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid. The move seeks to popularise the Jubilee party ahead of the National Delegates Conference slated for February 25 and 26. The NDC will culminate into a joint NDC  meeting with the ODM party which has also slated its NDC meetings on the same dates. Speaking during the Nyeri meeting, Kega said the region is now ready to vote for Raila. "We as Jubilee will not have a presidential candidate. But we have decided to look for friends with whom we will work. We have decided it is Raila whom we will back," he said. The Jubilee party is apparently working hard to bring back the mojo that characterized it in the 2017 polls. The party lost its key members to the UDA party now led by deputy president William Ruto.
