Presidential aspirant Reuben Kigame has claimed his life is in danger. He was driven to the Directorate of Criminal Investigation headquarters in Nairobi where he told the police he had been threatened through an audio sent to him. He shared the audio with the police who said they are investigating the same. Kigame later tweeted that he was “at the DCI headquarters to report an audio threat to my candidacy.” The nature of the said threats in the audio was not immediately revealed. Police handling the matter promised action. There are plans to offer Kigame armed officers. But police said they will wait until he is cleared as a candidate for the seat. All candidates are usually offered police protection. Kigame met the head of investigation John Gachomo who handed him to the serious crimes unit which is pursuing the claims. Kigame has announced his desire for the top seat on Kongamano la Mageuzi. The outfit is a coalition of diverse Kenyan individuals, organisations, initiatives and movements, generally identifiable as progressive within struggles for civil, political, social, cultural, economic and ecological justice and freedoms. The coalition says its ideological grounding seeks to unify the national agenda and lead the fight against the imperialism, all forms of fascism and colonialism.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
