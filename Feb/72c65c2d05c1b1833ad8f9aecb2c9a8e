Zetech Sparks hope to maximise on their home advantage to bag maximum points when they host Bunyore Starlets at Gems Cambridge on Sunday in one of the two Kenya Women's Premier League matches this weekend. The Benard Kitolo-coached side will, however,  miss the services of experienced goalkeeper Stellah Ahono who has been out for the last three weeks with a knee injury. Wingback Lavender Akeyo is with Harambee Starlets and will also miss out. Kitolo has cautioned his charges against underrating Bunyore, who have managed two wins in the KWPL at their Mumboha backyard. However, their diminishing away form has been a cause for concern for coach Daniel Arunga who has previously insisted on the need to grind points on their travels. The match was initially set for Sunday at 3 pm but was rescheduled to 10 am, according to Kitolo. "We are at home and aiming for nothing short of three points. They (Bunyore) have not won away from home and that is another reason for optimism. The match will be in the morning because the ground is booked in the afternoon," Kitolo said. "We can't afford to be complacent. Being newcomers, the only way to minimise their attacking threat is to deny them the ball by keeping possession. If we give them room, they will haunt us." Zetech are more fit after playing Ukunda and Harambee Starlets in friendly matches. On Saturday, Kangemi Ladies tackle Wadadia at Ligi Ndogo as they seek their first win of the season. Rooted at the bottom of the table on zero points, the Kawangware-based side are having a season to forget with a leaky defence and a confidence-deprived attack proving hard to fix. Postponed matches include Nakuru City Queens vs Gaspo Women, Thika Queens vs Vihiga, Trans-Nzoia vs Kisumu All Starlets, and Ulinzi vs Kayole.
