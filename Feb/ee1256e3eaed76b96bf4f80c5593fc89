Kirinyaga governor Ann Waiguru has dismissed claims that she has been handed a direct UDA party nomination ticket for the Kirinyaga governor seat. Speaking on Thursday, Waiguru reiterated that the April nominations will be conducted in a free, fair and credible manner. She appealed to her rivals to disregard the reports and ready themselves for a battle that she said will be credible and transparent. Waiguru said none of the UDA aspirants had been given a direct ticket and called on the party members to exercise decorum while campaigning. "Whoever citizens will rally behind will be given the party nomination ticket. Therefore, I urge all of you to carry out campaigns in a peaceful manner." Her sentiments come a month after Kirinyaga woman representative Wangui Ngirici decamped from UDA citing bias. Ngirici claimed the governor had already secured the nomination ticket adding that there was no need for her to be a party to a sham exercise. Ngirici is now seeking the governor seat on an independent ticket. Deputy President William Ruto had earlier assured both Waiguru and Ngirici of a transparent nomination exercise before her defection. Speaking in the Kanyekini-ini ward in Kirinyaga central, Waiguru exuded confidence that the Hustler Nation camp is poised for victory. She urged area residents to rally behind the team saying she was certain they will bag the majority of elective seats in the county. "We have a remarkable scorecard. Those with eyes can see our work. We are marketing what we have done and what we intend to do, should we be re-elected. Those going around peddling lies and hurling insults on my administration will be in for a rude shock because the people believe we have tangible projects on the ground which have transformed their lives." Waiguru at the same time rallied her residents behind the DP saying he is the best bet for the region. She said the DP understands their needs better and will address them if elected into office.
