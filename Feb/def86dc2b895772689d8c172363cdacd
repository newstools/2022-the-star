African heads of state are meeting in Addis Abba, Ethiopia, for a two-day summit that began on Saturday. This year's meeting comes at a time when Africa is reeling from a worrying resurgence of coups and the impact of Covid-19. Created in 1963, the AU previously known as the Organisation of African Unity was aimed at charting the continent's future as countries in the continent broke from the colonialism yoke. However, 59 years down the road, the 55-member group has little to show for its existence. The continent suffers from dictatorial leaders, coups and internal conflicts that have left thousands dead and millions displaced and exploitative trade deals with the West and China. The European Union formed way after the AU has greatly benefited member states by promoting fair trade deals, regional integration, ease of travel for residents of the bloc and joint infrastructural development. The AU is riddled with suspicious, selfish and egoistic leaders who have turned the Heads of State summit into a mere talk-shop where old friends meet to catch up. In the past 18 months, Africa has witnessed six coups or attempted coups but the AU maintains its usual see no evil, hear no evil stance. It's best shot has been the suspension of the errant member states. The AU must act and not engage in mere lip service in order to transform Africa.
