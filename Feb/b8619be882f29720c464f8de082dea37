Migori county finance officer Samuel Omuga has received a reprieve after a court squashed the decision by county to send him home. Omuga sued at the Employment and Labour Relations Court in Kisumu on February 14 after he was sent on compulsory leave. A letter copied to Central Bank of Kenya and Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang'o barred him as a signatory to the county funds. On February 15, Judge Stephen Radido gave Omuga stay orders until Monday, February 21. Omuga sued the county public service board, county and Governor Okoth Obado as first, second and third respondents respectively. The Controller of Budget and CBK were sued as first and second interested parties respectively. The respondents have been given up to February 18, to file their responses with the court offering further directions on February 21. On February 4, Migori CPSB secretary Martin Arondo said Omuga declined to honour summons on September 27 and October 19, last year to shed light on irregular engagement and payment of casuals. In the letter Omuga is also accused of “continued payment of casuals and/or contract employees who are only known to him without valid agreement.”
