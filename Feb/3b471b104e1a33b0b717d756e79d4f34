A veteran radio presenter from a prominent family, whose parents are highly placed government officials, is on the spot for his bad habits. The personality is known for going out almost every night, mostly weeknights. He goes, gets drunk and ends up fighting with security men at the joints. He eventually gets so high that he can't walk and even pees on himself. Most of the time when he is drinking, he is with young girls aged 20- 25 years. He is in his 40s and is alleged to be picking the girls from colleges. The girls he goes out with end up feeling very embarrassed hanging out with him, and most of them end up leaving him behind after he can't even recognise where he is and who he is with. He is also a well-known senior bachelor.
