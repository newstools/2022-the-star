Jubilee party on Saturday approved radical changes to its constitution including splitting the position of deputy leader into four, consequently handing President Uhuru Kenyatta sweeping powers at the apex. Further, Uhuru has put together a powerful political machine of more than a dozen parties. Curiously, most of the parties that back Raila in the State House race have joined Azimio through Jubilee. They appointed the President their lead negotiator in Azimio. Uhuru will definitely have major political say in the next government if Raila’s Azimio vehicle manages to edge out William Ruto’s Kenya Kwanza Alliance.
