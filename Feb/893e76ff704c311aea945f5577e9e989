Socialite Huddah Monroe is advising her fans about living a minimalist lifestyle. Through her Insta stories, she shared how she once went overboard to please her social media 'in-laws'. She said she will no longer do anything to please people. "I had a five-bedroom house and I only lived in one room and never ever used my two living rooms," she said. "The rest were empty. Filled with things I didn’t need. Clothes I never wore, shoes I never needed, just for show on these IG streets." She added, "I wanna be a minimalist in living, but not in the bank. If I’m alone, a two-bedroom condo is it for me, kinda things. I have lived in a large home and the only thing is never, it never brought me satisfaction, show off in 2019. If we wanna show off, show me the best self in 20 years." Huddah added that living a minimum lifestyle does not mean you are broke. "Check around what you don’t need and give out asap! Minimalist doesn’t mean broke, just better use of $$ you didn’t come to work and slave all your life. You dig?" She will be giving out everything she no longer uses, including her clothes, and she said she will get a few which she will keep wearing. "Like I said last year, I wanna be wearing the same style outfit, mtongea mchoke… Giving out 90 per cent of my clothes and shoes to charity this weekend. I wear most of my stuff once, and I always feel good giving back." In another post, Huddah complained about how people love exploiting celebrities and overpricing for everything they buy online. She said whenever she goes shopping, she is charged triple the amount just because she is famous and most sellers assume she is rich. "I am just an entrepreneur, not your ordinary girl, and every cent in my business counts. You can overcharge your sugar babies coz that is sugar daddy money. Mine is sweat and blood money."
