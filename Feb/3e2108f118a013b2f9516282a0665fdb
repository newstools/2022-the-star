Former gospel artist Weezdom has said he has no qualms with Diana Bahati who made her debut in music recently. Diana, who released a song dubbed mubaba a few days ago, has continued to impress her supporters ever since she made entry into the music industry. The song is doing well on Youtube and other streaming channels. Speaking to blogger Nicholas Kioko, Weezdom lauded Diana saying she has admirable songwriting skills whose end product is easily memorized by fans. Weezdom added that he was stunned by Diana's musical prowess considering that she had no signs of joining the music industry when he was still under EMB records. Given the long-standing differences between Weezdom and Bahati who is Diana's husband, his kind remarks will be a surprise to many. Regarding his art, Weezdom said despite calling it quits his gospel music career, his faith in God is unshaken.
