Long-serving Vihiga Queens'goalkeeper, Winfredeh Seda is not about to quit the club any time soon until she achieves her targets. Seda has been with the club since 2012 under the stewardship of Alex Alumira and currently Boniface Nyamunyamu. "I started playing for Queens while I was still in school and I have been there for the last 9 years," she said. She said prolonged injuries and financial crisis were the major reason why she suspended her contract with the club. Seda said her shoulder injury kept her off the club's activities. " I didn't play in both Caf and Cecafa tournaments, because of the injury," she said. Currently, she said she is working on her personal activities to restore her financial status as she recovers. While her injury is fully recovered, she said she will still need light training and simple matches to restore her fitness. "I am currently testing my fitness with a lower division side, Kisped Queens to see if I am in a position to return fully," she said. Seda was speaking at Maseno University, where she led  Kisped Queens in Maseno University open tournament over the weekend. Seda was responding to claims that she had retired from football. "Once I am fit to play for Vihiga Queens, you will all see me on the field, and am still working on my fitness," she said.
