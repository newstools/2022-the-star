Kenya Volleyball Federation League men's champions, General Service Unit face Prisons Mombasa and Kenya Defence Forces in two of the 16 matches lined up this weekend. The third leg of the men's league is set for the Nyayo gymnasium. The paramilitary side have won the last three KVF titles under coach Gideon Tarus, who doubles up as the national team gaffer. GSU began their title defence with a 3-0 thrashing of the Kenya Army during the first leg in Kapsabet last November. GSU will be without the services of middle blocker Simon Kipkorir 'Kosirai' who moved to Saudi Arabia top tier side, Al Ibtisam last month. Kosirai was the captain of the Kenyan champions. GSU also lost Cornelius Kiplagat to an Egyptian club in October but he was replaced by Equity's Joshua Kimaru. Last season's runner-up Kenya Prisons take on debutants Prisons Central and Trail Blazers respectively. Rejuvenated Kenya Ports Authority have a date with Prisons Nyanza on Saturday (10 am). The coastal side will also hope to disarm Kenya Army on Sunday. Kenya Forest Service face a tricky tie against KDF and Vihiga County. KFS finished sixth on their return to the top-flight league last season, scooping 22 points in the 13-team league, and have set their target of a top-four finish. The team, coached by  Wachira Gatuiria, are banking on new signings to give them a competitive edge. Vihiga will also target scalping Prisons in Rift Valley. Newbies Trail Blazers won't be pushovers as they seek to maintain their top-flight status. Coached by former national team coach Geoffrey Omondi, Blazers entertain Equity Bank on Sunday with the latter settling scores with Prisons Nairobi. Supremacy battle awaits Administration Police, who are hoping to stop their Kenya Army and Prison Central counterparts. An all-prison affair will see Prisons Western confront their Nairobi and Mombasa counterparts.
