A family from Ol Rongai, Rongai, in Nakuru county is distraught by the detention of their father’s body for four months over a Sh5.5 million hospital bill. Humphrey Kirega Mwai, 72, succumbed to Covid-19 on October 6, 2021, and his body has been held since then as his family has been unable to raise the medical fees. “My father was admitted to Nakuru Nursing Home on September 4, 2021, and we managed to pay a Sh90,000 deposit. He stayed in ICU for one month and two days until he passed away on October 6. The bill was Sh5.5 million. We are distressed,” daughter Grace Kigera told the Star on Friday. Mwai was a subsistence farmer. They took the body to Umash mortuary, where it remains.  That bill has also accumulated to Sh138,000. “We as a family have tried in vain to seek for a waiver from our Governor Lee Kinyanjui but he said it was not possible to give a waiver as the hospital is private,” Grace said. In another attempt to get the body and bury their father, the family organised a harambee and only managed to raise Sh250,000. The hospital said the amount was too small for them to make any payment arrangement. To release the body, the hospital is demanding Sh2.5 million and a title deed, which the family doesn't have. Even part of the Sh250,000 they managed to collect has been spent. This is because, Grace said, on December 10 they had to borrow some of the money to buy Actemra drug for Mwai, which cost Sh210,000. They money was demanded back, and they first offset Sh100,000 of the debt and the amount at hand now is Sh150,000. Grace said they really want to bury their father but they have tried their best and it's not good enough. The family is seeking an intervention that will result to a waiver or clearing the bill as they cannot afford to raise the Sh5.5 million. Grace can be reached on 0703 334 440. (Edited by V. Graham)
