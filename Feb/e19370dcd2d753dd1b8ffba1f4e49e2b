President Uhuru Kenyatta has explained how 2017 became one of the worst years in his tenure. Uhuru who was speaking when he met over 3000 youth at State House on Friday said 2017 was the most difficult year for him. “2013 tulipata nafasi na tukatenda yale ambayo tuliyatenda na tunamshukuru Mungu. Lakini in 2017, it was one of my worst and difficult year,” he said. Loosely translates to (In 2013 we were elected and we worked well. We thank God. But in 2017, this was one of my worst years...) Uhuru said that year was also one of his most trying times. “We were caught with two scenarios whereby our country was split into two and we had to make a choice and that choice was not an easy choice,” he said. “Because when you have to share and consult it's more difficult. But we took the hard route to the disappointments of even some of my own friends who thought we should take the easy route.” He said the issue that plagued Kenya was lack of representation amongst the people. "...which we tried to resolve through the Building Bridges Initiative. However a few individuals poisoned the minds of Kenyans," he said. In 2017, the August 8 presidential election left a mark as one of the most competitive polls ever held in the country's history since independence in 1963. It was the first to be annulled by the Supreme Court on grounds of massive irregularities and illegalities. The poll was cancelled following a petition filed by The then NASA leader Raila Odinga who argued that Uhuru of Jubilee was not validly elected. This caused a push and pull in the country with the opposition declining to accept Uhuru as their president and instead installed Raila as the people’s president. This dived the country into two. It was only in March 2018 that the two leaders shook hands to end the stalemate that saved the country.
