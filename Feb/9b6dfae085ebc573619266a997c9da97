About 13 million people in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia are facing severe hunger in the first quarter of this year due to drought, World Food Programme has said. In a statement on Tuesday, WFP said three consecutive failed rainy seasons have decimated crops and caused abnormally high livestock deaths. "Shortages of water and pasture are forcing families from their homes and leading to increased conflict between communities," the statement read in part. "Further forecast of below average rainfall are threatening to worsen and compound dire conditions in the coming months." Regional director in WFP Michael Dunford said harvests are ruined, livestock are dying and hunger Is growing as recurrent droughts affect Africa. "The situation requires immediate humanitarian action and consistent support to build the resilience of communities for the future," he said. He said further forecasts of below-average rainfall are threatening to worsen and compound dire conditions in the coming months. Following this, WFP has appealed for assistance in order to avoid a major humanitarian crisis, like the one the world witnessed in 2011 when 250,000 people died of hunger in Somalia. Last week, Marsabit county commissioner Paul Rotich flagged off consignments of relief food to cushion vulnerable families against drought. At least 32,000 vulnerable families across the county will benefit from the food supplies. Each beneficiary received 10kgs of rice, 7kgs of beans and fortified wheat. More to follow
