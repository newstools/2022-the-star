Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria on Saturday walked independently for the first time in 137 days following a 2021 accident that left him immobile with third-degree burns on his feet. Kuria was seen walking with a group of friends and relatives. After a 4km walk with the team, they were seen taking pictures as they posed for the camera along the roads. With T-shirts written “Keep fit to keep feet”, the team walked again around the hospital vicinity as they looked for other spots to take the pictures. “Thank you very much American Hospital and to Science. I am very proud to be part of this pioneering cutting edge technology and it is my prayer that this will work for many other patients who have given up on other forms of treatment,” the legislator said. He is expected to return to Kenya on February 19. A welcome party will be held at Thika stadium. "Lets keep the spirit and the faith. I want to welcome you to JKIA 6am," Kuria said. Kuria is currently in Dubai where he is recuperating after undergoing stem cell surgery. In December, Kuria revealed that he would be among pioneers to undergo stem cell surgery in the world. “I am scheduled for stem cell surgery this week. This is a rare surgery and I will be among the pioneers to undergo it in the world,” he said. The legislator's feet exploded after standing on an electric mat for four hours, sustaining third-degree burns. He thanked Kenyans for standing with him in prayers throughout the tough time he has been through.
