Old town residents in Mvita have blamed narrow feeder roads for the Wednesday fire at Kibokoni that left five people dead and three others injured. They say the roads are too small for fire extinguishers to pass through. The residents have urged the government to put up a fire assembly place and mount fire extinguishers, for easy access to water in case of any fires. Red Cross coordinator Rajab Musa said the fire was caused by a gas cylinder explosion. He said the three injured who are in critical condition, are being treated at the Coast Referral Hospital. Musa said Red Cross is planning on training youths who helped put out the fire to perfect their skills and have enough equipment in case of such incidents. Abdallah Amur the area MCA said with the fire extinguisher and efforts from residents, they managed to put out the fire. He said investigations are still ongoing. Mahmoud Ibrahim who lost his sister Faiza Ali and the brother-in-law Jamal Ahmed, said the fire spread fast because the house was made of wood. “One of the deceased is a woman and had managed to get one of her children out of the burning house, but as she went back to pick the second child, she was unable to find her way out and they lost their lives,” he said. The residents also blamed the government for laxity after they arrived at the incident at 8.30 am, an hour after the fire broke out. “If we had a safe place with enough water, this could not have happened. They need to address our challenges,” Abdallah, a resident said. Resident Mohammed Samata said the Kenya Power lines are very low, endangering their lives and the problem needs to be sorted out. “This is a heritage area that needs to be taken care of, we need an alarm to alert residents in case of any fire incidences,” Samata said.
