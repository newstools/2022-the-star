Deputy President William Ruto left the country on Sunday morning for his UK and US tour. The DP is set to take a 12-day break from active political campaigns to attend to various matters in the two countries. His head of the Presidential campaign secretariat Governor Josephat Nanok was with him at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Nanok revealed that he will be part of the DP's tour. "Accompanying DP William Ruto on an official whistle tour of the West, with a post 09 August 2022 message of hope and a better future for Kenyans and our nation. Lord, continue guiding and protecting us," he said. Also present was Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya. His head of International relations Ababu Namwamba had earlier announced the tour. He said he was honouring invites by senior officials and top policy institutes in Washington, DC, and London. “In Washington, DC the Deputy President is scheduled to meet, among others, officials of the State Department and the Pentagon as well as the US Government National Security Council (NSC) Advisor.” Ruto will share his thoughts on foreign policy, democracy, and governance, and expound his economic vision for Kenya and Africa. He will also speak at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and at the University of Arizona’s Washington Entrepreneurship Hub. The USA leg of the trip will conclude with a meeting with Kenyans in the diaspora. "In London, Ruto will meet senior UK Government officials, visit the NationalCounter-Terrorism Center and speak at both the Commonwealth Secretariat and the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). He will also engage the Kenyan Diaspora in the UK, and pay a courtesy call on the archbishop of Canterbury, His Grace Justin Welby," Ababu added. Ababu said the Ruto trip seeks to further strengthen ties with the country’s traditional friends and partners.
