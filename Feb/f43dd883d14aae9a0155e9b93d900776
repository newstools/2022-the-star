Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu seems to have taken his rivalry with deputy president William Ruto to another level. Speaking in Kitui County during the Azimio la Umoja rally on Wednesday, Ngilu said he no longer watches the DP on TV. Ngilu accused Ruto of letting President Uhuru Kenyatta down in the running of the government saying he does not deserve the presidency. “I’m shocked. Mimi nikimuona huyo mtu kwa TV saa zingine na swtich off until atoke (whenever I see him on TV I sometimes switch off the tv until the news is aired," she said. The governor termed the DP as a pirate who has scuttled the government’s projects and efforts to unite the country. He appealed to Kenyans to consider electing someone who will listen to their grievances and address them. “Tunataka kiongozi ambaye atafikiria maslahi ya watoto, kina mama, wazee na familia (We want a leader who will listen to the needs of the children, women, men and families),” Ngilu said. She added: “Instead of laptops, he is opting for a wheelbarrow…for those who understand English, tell him the difference between a laptop and a wheelbarrow”. The governor further claimed that the 50 per cent he was given in the Jubilee administration was awarded to his proxies who performed poorly. She further criticized the DP for associating himself with the construction of the Thwake Multipurpose dam. Ngilu said the project was initiated by the grand coalition government led by President Mwai Kibaki and ODM leader Raila Odinga who was then a prime minister.
