Gospel singer Ben Cyco says his friends were against him marrying his YouTuber bae Wanjiru Njiru. Cyco said most of them wanted him to marry from the church. His friends were also against Wanjiru's dressing. Speaking on their podcast The Joyride, Ben shared, "When I started hitting on Wanjiru, I mentioned it to my friends and most of them were from church. "They were against me marrying her. They were like, 'Is she saved? Are you sure?' I decided to give this 'Jezebel' a chance but she would sometimes choma picha by showing up wearing a mini skirt when meeting my friends." Cyco said he has not lost friends because of his relationship with Wanjiru. "The friendships I have lost is because of life. But my ex had warned me against talking to you," he said. The two tied the knot last November at a private location.
