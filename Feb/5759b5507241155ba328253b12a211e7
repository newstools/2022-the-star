Coffee farmers from Mt Elgon region in Bungoma county have linked the hike of fertiliser prices to poor production. Bungoma county is ranked sixth in coffee production behind Murang’a, Nyeri, Embu, Kirinyaga and Kiambu counties. Coffee farming is practiced in Sirisia, Mt Elgon, Kabuchai and Bumula constituencies. In an interview with the Star, Ben Mulupi, Kimama Farmers Cooperative society chief executive officer, said that the hike in prices has negatively impacted coffee production. “The hike in fertiliser prices has affected coffee production in Bungoma county as farmers depend on it. My appeal to government is that they should not wait for farmers to lament before reducing the prices,” Mulupi said. “We only play our part as cooperatives to ensure that farmers are getting all they need but government has failed to support us,” he said. He added that being a political season farmers should avoid concentrating on politics and prepare their farms ahead of the rainy season.
