Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth has said President Uhuru Kenyatta remains the undisputed Mt Kenya region kingpin. While reacting to Uhuru's endorsement of ODM leader Raila Odinga, Kenneth said the backing will earn Azimio La Umoja 40 per cent of votes from the Mt Kenya region. “Wengine wetu tumekua na Raila kwa miaka mitatu na tunaamini ya kwamba kwa uchaguzi uliopita alikua na less than 3 per cent, lakini kwa huu uchaguzi bila shaka atafikisha 50 per cent,” Kenneth said. Loosely translated to: "Some of us have been with Raila for three years and in the last election, he got less than 3 per cent votes from the region. But I have no doubts that he will now get 50 per cent of Mt Kenya votes". He spoke on Thursday during the burial of former Kangema MP Tirus Nyagu who passed away after suffering from stomach cancer. Ngahu died on February 12, 2022, in a hospital in Nairobi where he had been admitted since January 13. He served Kangema constituency after being elected in a by-election that followed the death of former MP John Njoroge Michuki in 2012. Kenneth welcomed Uhuru's remarks in the Sagana III meeting saying they were factual. The politician is among the Mt Kenya leaders billed as Raila's potential running mate.
