Democratic Action Party - Kenya (DAP-K) on Friday pitched a tent at Posta grounds, Bungoma County. The party, which is affiliated with Azimio la Umoja movement led by Raila Odinga, held a major rally that brought together a host of leaders from the region in a bid to unite the Luhya nation. The rally is expected to counter forays made by the Ford Kenya party that has dominated Bungoma and parts of Trans Nzoia County for years. Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa is among the leaders who have graced the events. CS Wamalwa is deemed as the de facto party leader of the outfit as he has been receiving defectors to the party lately together with other leaders. The Friday rally is expected to welcome Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati to the DAP-K. Wangamati fell out with Wetang'ula who is now campaigning for the Speaker of the Senate Ken Lusaka for the governor seat. Kakamega County Governor Wycliffe Oparanya was also present. Other leaders present include DAP-K secretary-general Eseli Simiyu, DAP-K party leader Wafula Wamunyinyi, former Westlands MP Fred Gumo, former Kanduyi MP Alfred Khang'ati,  former Bungoma county woman MP Regnalda WanyonyiKa.
