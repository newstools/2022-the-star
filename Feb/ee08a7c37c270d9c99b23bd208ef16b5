Up to 65 per cent of water springs in Nyamira and Kisii counties could be contaminated by human waste, Nema has said. National Environment Management Authority board member Samuel Nyang’eso said latrines are the source of contamination. He urged residents to boil the water or treat it before drinking. The official spoke on Sunday at Kisii Sports Club during a church fundraiser for gospel artist Riziki, who is undergoing osteoporosis treatment at Tenwek Hospital. "With declining land in Gusii, some people settle near water points and dig latrines there. This is very dangerous. We ask chiefs to intervene whenever they see such incidents," Nyangeso said. He said while the phenomenon is widely prevalent in Kisii and Nyamira counties, there is a possibility that other counties with huge populations are experiencing the same. "You walk through some villages and find a latrine near a borehole or a spring. We are sitting on ticking time bomb if we can not quickly address this,’’ the former Kisii town Mayor said. He said about 65 per cent of all water points may be contaminated by faeces. "We ask health officers to team up with the administrations to create awareness on where people should set up latrines. This will reduce diseases among our people,"Nyangeso said. He also urged political leaders to help artistes during times of need. Some artistes, he said, die poor because of poor remuneration. "Let’s not use them when we want entertainment only, some have serious challenges which require our collective help," Nyangeso said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
