Former Wiper Executive Director Dr. Jared Siso's bid for Borabu Constituency received a boost on Friday after receiving an endorsement from Borabu elders. Siso will be seeking to replace the incumbent Ben Momanyi who is seeking to unseat Nyamira Governor Nyaribo in the August 9 General Election. Siso resigned from Wiper last year to concentrate on his campaigns. He was the longest serving Wiper executive director. He will be contesting the seat on a Wiper ticket. "Today (Friday) I received useful endorsement from our community council of elders, who endorsed and blessed my candidature for the seat of MP Borabu Constituency in August 9," Siso told the Star on phone. "I thank the people of Borabu and I am humbled by your trust in my capacity to serve." Siso was replaced by Justine Kyambi as the new Wiper executive director in changes to announced by party leader Kalonzo Musyoka in July 2021. In the changes, former Nasa chief executive officer Norman Magaya who worked closely with the ODM leader during the high stakes 2017 elections was announced as Musyoka's political advisor. The Nasa CEO was unveiled on the day Wiper unanimously resolved to leave the opposition coalition for One Kenya Alliance. “Norman is a very famous name. He said before they wind up Nasa, they might wind him up as well. Norman, thank you so much for joining Wiper. He is going to work closely with the party leader going forward,” Kalonzo said.
