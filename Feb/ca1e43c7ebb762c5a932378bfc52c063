Comedian Eric Omondi has locked himself inside a 'transparent cube' outside parliament buildings in an effort to lobby MPs to debate on increasing the local airplay and content. He says the parliamentarians should ensure up to 75 per cent of music and other artistic work played on Kenyan TVs and radios is local content. "I will remain here until they start the debate. This is a hunger strike," he said. Six heavily built men in black suits, apparently his bodyguards, are surrounding the cube. Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie said Omondi's demands had nothing to do with the Copyright (Amendment) Bill, 2021. "Eric is championing for 75 per cent of local Kenyan content. So we want to lobby our MPs to be on this course and to champion the course," he said. Omondi said he will stay at the Parliament Building as long as it takes. "Tomorrow you will find me here. I'm not going anywhere until the MPs start this conversation," he said. In November last year, Omondi was arrested after attempting to storm Parliament buildings. The comedian had tried to lead music artists in storming Parliament in a bid to fix the music industry in Kenya. Taking to social media, he said, "History loading...Tomorrow 10 am!!! Tuesday, November 16th will be remembered for years to come. Calling Upon all musicians/artists and all media houses/outlets to meet us at Parliament Building tomorrow 10 am."
