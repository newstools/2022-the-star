Vote wisely to ensure you are in government Defence Cabinet Secretary for Eugene Wamalwa has told the Luhya community. Wamalwa said as the political temperature in the country continues to rise the Luhya people should find a shorter route to power. He urged the residents to ensure they fully participate in the formation of the next government to be among the top communities that will benefit. Wamalwa said with too many political formations in the region they will never achieve their dreams. “I am not buying my brothers idea saying that it's wise to have many political formations that will just split our votes and weaken our preferred candidate for state house,” Wamalwa. The CS said the more they fragment as a community the more they will stay out of government. Wamalwa said if the Mulembe nation can cast their vote in one basket their stake will be a bit higher on the negotiating table. The CS said he has never voted for Raila Odinga nor supported him politically but he is doing so because he is sure the former Prime Minister will form the next government. “We have no time to gamble with our votes, nothing hurts like being in the opposition,” CS said. “God has given me power to predict where power goes, and I have always casted my vote on the government side,” he added. Wamalwa was speaking at Mumboha ground during the funeral service of the late Mama Dorina Marende, mother to former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende. Eugene’s sentiments were echoed by Kakamega governor Wyclife Oparanya. “In 2002-2007 I was in opposition service delivery for my people was a problem, things only changed when I joined the government under Nusu-mkate government of 2008-2013,” said Oparanya.
