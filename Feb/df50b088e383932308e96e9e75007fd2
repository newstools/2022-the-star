The immediate Transport CAS Wavinya Ndeti has officially started to mobilise voters in Machakos County to vote her in as their next governor. She visited Joska, Malaa, Koma, and Nguluni. Wavinya tendered her resignation as a public servant on Friday. Her resignation comes days after Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua issued a notice detailing the deadline for the resignation of public servants seeking elective positions. She will be seeking to succeed Governor Alfred Mutua who is serving his second last term. Wavinya is the latest aspirant to announce her candidature and will square it out with State House Chief of Staff Nzioka Waita among others. Waita stated that his plan is to serve the people of Machakos. He insisted that he will make Machakos a city in five years if elected governor. Wavinya's resignation comes after Tourism CAS Joseph Boinnet resigned from the seat on Thursday. The former Inspector General of Police made the disclosure at a meeting with MPs at the sports committee. “Today’s assignment is the last because I am tendering my resignation to seek a leadership position in the county where I was born and brought up,” Boinnet said.
