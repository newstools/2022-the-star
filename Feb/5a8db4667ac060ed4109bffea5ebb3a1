The Kipsigis' Myoot council of elders and group of religious leaders from Bomet have struck a deal that will see the three governor seat aspirants from the county attend a prayer meeting this Saturday. Council's chairman Paul Leleito who brokered the deal said there was a need for Governor Hillary Barchok, his rivals John Mosonik and CCM party leader Isaac Rutto to come together for the common good of the people. Leleito said despite their political differences, the leaders ought to conduct peaceful campaigns to redeem the image of the county. "We know there exist political supremacies and differences but when we unite and avoid attacking or using abusive words in public gatherings our people will also remain as one," said Leleito. The Saturday's meeting will now proceed as organised with only prayers being conducted. No cleansing will be undertaken by the elders as had earlier been announced. The three aspirants will be required not to ferry their supporters to the prayer venue. The attendees will also not be allowed to don their party merchandise or symbols during the event. The trio further affirmed that they will be meeting after two weeks to review the progress. "We have agreed to conduct peaceful campaigns and we shall be meeting once in a while to discuss how we are progressing," said Mosonik in a statement echoed by Barchok and Ruto in their addresses. Barchok had last week announced that the event was meant to cleanse Bomet green stadium from evils. Mosonik had, however, rejected the invite saying he was not a party to it. College of bishops chairman Stanley Koech who was part of the deal called on leaders to maintain peace and avoid inciting their supporters.
