South Rift top guns on Wednesday backed ODM leader Raila Odinga's bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 9 General Elections. The delegation led by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos described the opposition chief as the best bet for the South Rift region. Tolgos said his team will deliver at least 40 per cent of the South Rift vote to Raila. "My job is to coordinate the leaders from the region and I am certain we will push Raila's vote to at least 40 per cent," Tolgos said. The powerful delegation also had the former head of Public Service Sally Kosgey, ex-MP Paul Sang, CAS Stephen Tarus and Kipkorir Menjo.
