Luanda MP Chris Omulele has urged aspirants in Vihiga to support ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid. He said Raila is the best candidate for the seat as he has promised to revive the economy if elected in August. Omulele spoke at Kidundu Stadium on Monday where Governor Wilber Ottichilo had organised an Azimio la Umoja rally. “We need to support him [Raila] to the fullest to ensure he wins this time round,” he said. “If Raila wins the presidency, I will be happy as Omulele because Kenyans will count on democracy, economy and equality that Raila has fought for many years,” he said. He urged Vihiga residents to vote in aspirants allied to Azimio la Umoja. The MP said ODM nominations will be free and fair. Five aspirants have expressed interest in the Luanda parliamentary race in a bid to unseat Omulele. They are Noah Okaya, who is planning to vie as an independent candidate, Dick Maungu DAP-Kenya, Tom Atingo-UDA, Albert Obbuyi DAP-Kenya and Edward Magomere. “I'm urging Luanda people to elect a sober leader who will protect the interests of the people and support Raila’s presidency,” Omulele said. Earlier this month, all aspirants said they appreciate the work done by the incumbent, but it is time he gave space for fresh leadership. Omulele said those eyeing the seat are welcome, and that voters will decide. The lawmaker will be banking on his track record to secure a third term as Luanda MP. However, some voters have urged the MP to seek a higher political position. Boda boda riders across the subcounty have, meanwhile, urged all aspirants to deliver to residents. Edited by A.N
