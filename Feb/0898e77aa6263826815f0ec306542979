Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro has joined the list of celebrities who have declared their type of who they should date or marry. Kamene said she cannot get married to any Kenyan celebrity as no one matches her 'standards'. "I can't get married to anyone, these people are very dramatic," she said  during the Morning Kiss. Comedian Elsa Majimbo, while appearing on The Wicked Edition weekly show, said her type of man should be wealthy. "My type is rich. You know? (Laughs). What I expect is that someone who is broke or someone who doesn’t have money shouldn’t approach me," she said. "First of all, my dowry is $4 million. If you are unable to afford that… (laughs)… I cannot even consider." And Huddah complained about the poor servings available as far as Kenyan men go.
