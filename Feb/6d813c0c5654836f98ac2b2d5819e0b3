Tanzanian actress Wema Sepetu has responded to the claims she has been using a taxi for years because she can't afford a car. In a recent interview uploaded on YouTube by Foxe TV, Wema said she has a right to live the way she wants. "So what if I use a taxi? It is my own life and as long as I am okay with it, I care less," she said. "Everyone is entitled to their opinion. People can talk all they want because it is normal to talk about others. After all, I also talk about other people but you don't have to make somebody know what you gossip about them." Her response comes after Aristote, a popular Tanzanian salon owner went in an interview and said Wema is poor. In a viral video, he said Wema does not make money from her social media. "If that is what makes him happy, let him continue because I don't care as long as it does not cost me anything." Wema added that she has not owned a car for two years.
