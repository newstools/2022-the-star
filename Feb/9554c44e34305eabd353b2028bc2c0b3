A storm has erupted in Mombasa’s Governor Hassan Joho's paradise after his wife of 10 years filed for divorce. Madina Giovanni Fazzini said her marriage to Joho was beyond reconciliation as it had broken down irretrievably with no chance of revival. Fazzini said each party had moved on with their separate lives and therefore there was need for official divorce. “There is no hope or possibility of reconciliation or compromise of whatsoever nature between me and the governor,” reads part of the suit. Fazzini, who is reportedly an Italian, filed a suit at the Kadhi’s court in Mombasa on January 26 through Aziz M Ngare law firm. In her affidavit, the mother of two said she got married to the flamboyant politician in February 2011 and they were blessed with two children. She said they lived as husband and wife for only two years before they separated. In June 2013, Joho is said to have moved out of their matrimonial home worsening the already troubled marriage. Fazzini said she continued living in the same house with her children until in 2020 when she decided to move out and relocated to Malindi, where she currently lives. The wife said she was sure the marriage cannot be revived either legally or socially. Fazzini said with the grounds, she had not been coerced into filing the matter and had done so by her own volition. The Kadhi’s court granted the governor, who is on the campaign trail for Azimio la Umoja, some 15 days to enter appearance and file his responses to the suit.
