The revised academic calendar released in 2019 spells that the 2021 KCPE exams be written between March 7 and March 10, while KCSE will be conducted between March 11 to April 1. These will also be the last KCPE and KCSE examinations done outside the traditional November-December period as the school calendar normalises. Those in Class 7 and Form 3 will sit their national examinations between November and December 2022.
