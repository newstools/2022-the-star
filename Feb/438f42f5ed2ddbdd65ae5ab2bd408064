Kenya Private Schools Association has appealed to the Teachers Service Commission to relax rules on the employment of teachers by the private schools. Kepsa national chairman Charles Ochome said TSC must remain flexible and allow private schools to employ teachers based on talent. Ochome said TSC has directed that they must strictly employ registered teachers to take pupils through the Competency Based Curriculum. “We are ready to bring in tutors who can train pupils in different talents, not necessarily trained and registered ones,” he said. He added that there is no need to put obstacles and barring talented people from employment opportunities. Ochome who was speaking in Kisumu added “We have talented people like coaches who can teach our children football, music yet they don't require to attend teachers training colleges,”. He further urged TSC to allow them scout for talent. CBC, he said was is a new concept which should be moulded to success but putting roadblocks will just hinder its implementations. “A lot of investments, from both government and private sector have been put into this curriculum and it will be unfortunate if we waste those resources,” he said. He lauded Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha for easing up the guidelines of registrations of schools that are supposed to offer junior secondary. “I think that is the best thing Magoha has ever done for us in the private sector and we applaud him,” he said.
