Parents and residents of Nyeri Central subcounty have raised concerns over staffing parity in mixed primary schools, with some having all-female teachers. Though the number of female teachers is relatively high in many schools in the subcounty, there are cases where some schools have no single male teacher. A case in point is Kiganjo and Ndurutu primary schools which have had no male teacher since 2020. Resident Brian Githinji alias Teckno said this has left the boys without a male figure to guide and listen to them. “You know as the students approach Class 6, 7 and 8, they are in their adolescence and puberty stage and they will need guidance and counselling. The most appropriate person to do so should be a person of the same gender as the pupil,” he said. The schools are compelled to seek help from the institution's night guards whenever male pupils have issues that ought to be addressed by a male. Githinji said in cases where some boys have no father figures at home to guide them, the gap is usually filled by male teachers. He called on staffing officers at the Teachers Service Commission to address the issue. Muthoni Muruku also from the area said the problem is replicated in many other schools. Education CS George Magoha during his recent visit to Nyeri told the media that there has been a problem with ensuring there is gender balance in schools across the country as a large number of teachers are female. Magoha, however, said it was still good for pupils because at that age, they need mother figures but added that the ministry was doing everything possible to ensure there are teachers of both genders in secondary schools. “For high school, there is a good mix. If you go to a boys’ school, you will find a few female teachers there to provide the mother figure connection,” he said. Edited by A.N
