Two people were on Friday charged with conspiring to defraud CIC General Insurance Limited Sh9.2 million. The charge sheet indicates that the Sh9.2 million was fraudulently paid into an account belonging to one Jacqueline Wambua upon processing fictitious KPLC public utility claims in her favour. It is alleged that Michael Mwangi, a Claims analyst at the firm, facilitated the fraudulent processing of KPLC Public liability claims in favour of Wambua. Mwangi and Wambua both purported that the latter made genuine and valid claims with CIC Insurance arising from fire damage to her properties. Mwangi is also charged with intent to defraud CIC General Limited  Sh1.9 million. It is said he fraudulently uploaded a payment requisition of the KPLC public utility claim in the names of Wambua. He did this by manipulating the firm's electronic data system in a bid to show that he was making a genuine and valid payment requisition in favour of Wambua. Mwangi faced other counts of fraudulent false accounting, stealing and forgery. The offences are said to have been committed between 25 January 2016 and September 2021. The duo appeared before Chief Magistrate Susan Shitubi and denied the charges. They were each granted cash bail of Sh1.5 million or a bond of Sh2 million. The case will be heard on February 18.
