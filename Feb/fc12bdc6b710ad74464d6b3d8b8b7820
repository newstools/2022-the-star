Two men have been sentenced to 50 years behind bars and a fine of a 63million slapped on them by a Wajir court, for trafficking in narcotics. In a ruling delivered by Senior resident magistrate Mugendi Nyagah, the accused Mohammed Oloo and Abraham Hassan were handed a heavy sentence after they were arrested by detectives ferrying a consignment of cannabis Sativa worth Sh21 million. On April, 4,2021, the two were intercepted at Athibool in Wajir county, ferrying 700kgs of the illegal drug to Nairobi. The lorry ferrying the consignment had been divided into compartments at the top, where the drug disguised as bags of cement was carefully concealed. The second accused person Abraham Hassan who absconded the court session was sentenced in absentia and his Sh1 million bond was forfeited to the State. Consequently, a warrant for his arrest was issued and detectives have launched a manhunt for him. Meanwhile, the owner of the lorry has been granted 14 days to show cause why the lorry should not be forfeited to the state.
