Dismas Indiza, Eric Ooko, Greg Snow and Jacob Okello are among top golfers headed for the penultimate round of the Safari Tour slated for Karen Country Club this weekend. The event will be curtain-raised by the ProAm on Saturday. Vincent Wang’ombe of Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) said the ProAm will give the professional players a chance to practice for the event. Other top players include Edwin Mudanyi,  Zimbabwean Robinson Chinhoi and Ugandan Philip Kasozi. The event will be played on a 72-hole stroke play format. “The event will feature a big field of over 40 golfers. Being among the last two events on the road to the Magical Kenya Open, we expect the golfers to give their all,” said Wang’ombe. “The Safari Tour will pick 10 players for Kenya Open qualifications. Two of the 10 will be pros from the African region. For pros, the season ends this month. We will have a new Safari Tour season in May.” Wang’ombe added that the numbers allocated by the Kenya Open to Safari Tour might increase depending on the latitude given by European Tour. Among those tipped to qualify early are Indiza (Mumias), Simon Ngige (Thika), Ooko (Golf Park), Greg Snow (Muthaiga) and David Wakhu (Golf Park). Meanwhile, KCB Bank has injected a Sh4million sponsorship towards the 2021/2022 Safari Golf Tour series. The funding channeled through the Kenya Open Golf Limited (KOGL) will go towards supporting the three legs of the series. The first round was played in Limuru two weeks ago, the second leg will tee off in Karen on Saturday while the third will be played on February 16 at Muthaiga Golf Club. “We are keen on supporting sports at all levels, to build talent for local and global competitions. The Safari Tour Series has been key in developing professional golfers in East Africa and beyond,” said KCB’s Rosalind Gichuru.
