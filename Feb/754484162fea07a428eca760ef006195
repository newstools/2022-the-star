Former Tahidi High actor Abel Mutua says his wife Judy Nyawira is free to walk out of their marriage anytime she feels it's too much. The actor said there is no way he can fully make his wife happy forever. In an interview with SPM Buzz, the celebrity narrated his marriage life and what has made it thrive thus far. The two have been married for seven years. "The trust that's in that marriage is out of this world," she said. "How we have planned ourselves is working for us. I told her, 'Babe, the day it gets to a point and you feel now this is it, do not feel guilty to tell me you have reached the end." He said the funniest part about their pact is that where people have been given freedom, they never do what they have been asked to do. The father of one said they agreed to protect their peace at all costs. "There's no marriage that's perfect. Once in a while, there will be issues, but when it gets to a point where it starts affecting you healthwise, then no."
