Karen Nyamu, who is vying for Nairobi senatorial seat, has promised to pay for treatment for a boda-boda rider who had an accident. She also promised to buy him a car for his taxi business. The controversial politician visited boda-boda driver Enock Nyanchoka at his rented house on Kawangware Street after a relative wrote her a message on her Facebook account asking for help. Nyamu said the young man wrote her a touching message that he had an accident and was going through a rough time. He needed medical funds to help finalize his leg treatment, so as to get back to hustling. Nyamu promised to take him to Kijabe Missionary Hospital and cover his medical expenses. "Before the accident, Enock had a dream to become a taxi man. I will look for donors and my good friends to fulfill his dream of owning a taxi," she wrote. Nyamu has been on the spotlight for different reasons, not just vying for a political seat. She made headlines when she was in a love triangle with talented musician Samidoh. Recently, photos of Nyamu kissing a man who was allegedly a member of the county assembly in Nairobi, circulated on the internet but she publicly denied the allegations.
