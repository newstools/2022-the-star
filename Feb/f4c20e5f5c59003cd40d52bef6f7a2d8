A total of eighteen men's and ten ladies' teams have registered for the third leg of the 2021/22 Homologated National Beach volleyball tour set for this weekend, Mombasa. The first and second legs took place in Homa Bay Beach Resort and Wote, Machakos respectively. The Mombasa leg offers national team coaches Salome Wanjala (women) and Patrick Owino (men) the opportunity to monitor the progress of their players ahead of the Commonwealth Games qualifiers next month. Olympians Gaudencia Makokha and Brackcides Agala headline the women's teams for the Mombasa show. The pair defied odds to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic Games for the first time in Kenya's history. The pair of Phosca Kasisi and Yvonne Wavinya are also regulars in the game while Naomi Too and Veronica Adhiambo cannot be overlooked. The aforementioned players are in the initial squad for the qualifiers slated for Accra, Ghana, between March 24-29 and are expected in residential training camp immediately after the tournament. Ibrahim Oduor and James Mwaniki highlight the men's cadre. The accomplished duo is favourites to win the competition because of their invaluable experience but will not get the going easy. Trail Blazers' Juliard Mbappe and David Neeke won the Wote leg and will give Oduor and Mwaniki a run for their money.
