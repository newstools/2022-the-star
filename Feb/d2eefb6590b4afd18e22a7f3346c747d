Some aspirants in the Luanda parliamentary race fear they will ruin their chances of being on the ballot if they go for nominations. The aspirants are urging voters to elect leaders based on their capacity to deliver and not party affiliation. The Luanda race has attracted five aspirants Noah Okaya, Tom Atingo (UDA), Dick Maungu, Abert Obbuyi (DAP-K) and Edward Magomere. The five are set to face incumbent MP Chris Omulele of ODM. Okaya and Maungu have yet to pick their political vehicles. The two said they will support Azimio la Umoja under ODM leader Raila Odinga. Maungu dismissed claims he has joined DAP-K party. “There are those saying that I have gone to DAP-K, I don’t know who confirmed to them because as ​of​ now, I have not announced my political party,” Maungu told the Star on the phone. "On this party issue, we must be keen otherwise it might turn out to be a slaughterhouse for our political careers.” Okaya also confirmed he has yet to settle on a party. He said with the new rules on party nominations they must be keen so they do not lose out. Last month, Omulele urged aspirants in Vihiga to support Raila's presidential bid. He said Raila is the best candidate for the seat as he has promised to revive the economy if elected in August. “We need to support him [Raila] to the fullest to ensure he wins this time round,” he said. “If Raila wins the presidency, I will be happy as Omulele because Kenyans will count on democracy, economy and equality that Raila has fought for many years,” he said. He urged Vihiga residents to vote in aspirants allied to Azimio la Umoja. The MP said ODM nominations will be free and fair. Edited by A.N
