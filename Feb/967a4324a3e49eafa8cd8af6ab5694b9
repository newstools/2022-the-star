If you’re a fan of margaritas, then you’re going to love this fresh, minty spin cocktail. Note: If you don’t have syrup with you or any other sweetener, you can use honey as a substitute. These margaritas aren't too sweet, but pack a nice, punchy flavour from lots of lime juice. The mint adds a clean, fresh note to the finish. Ingredients Method Squeeze a lime wedge on a flat plate then roll the rims of your glasses on it. Place salt in a small saucer and proceed to dip the rims in salt to coat the top of the glass. Fill the glasses with crushed ice. In a large jug/pitcher, pour in the tequila, lime juice, orange liqueur, agave syrup, and mint sprigs. You can switch up this recipe to your liking by adding strawberry syrup if you want something sweeter. Using the handle of a wooden stirring spoon, gently muddle (squeeze). Empty the mixture evenly into your prepared cups through a fine-mesh strainer/ sieve and throw out the solids left in the jug. Garnish with additional mint sprigs and serve.
