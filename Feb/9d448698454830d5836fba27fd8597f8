Five Chinese accused of mining  in Migori county without a licence will remain in custody pending their bail application. Yao Youming, Edion Lion, Wangizi Ling, Shun Ming and Wang Yang were detained bail by Milimani senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi. He said they refused to produce their documents to the investigating officer for verification. The charge sheet says that on January 26 this year at Arundo area of Rongo in Migori county, the five were found engaging in mining activities without a valid licence or permit. Others not before the court were also charged. They are charged with engaging in mining business without being authorised to do so by a permit from Rio-Kavirondo Ltd. They face a further charge of being in Kenya unlawfully. All five denied the charges and were detained at Industrial Area remand. The investigating officer told the court that the accused persons refused to identify themselves and he suspected the names they gave were not their real names. Meanwhile, a nursery school cook was charged with defiling a four-year-old child. Alex Opicho Wafula was charged with defiling the minor while at school on January 26. He denied the charge before Milimani chief magistrate Wendy Kagendo. The victim’s lawyer objected to his release on bail on grounds he is a flight risk and may interfere with investigations. The lawyer said the accused person is still an employee of the school and therefore a risk to the minor and other pupils. The court heard that the suspect was positively identified by the victim and the prosecution is waiting for the medical report from the government chemist. The minor is still admitted in hospital. A pre-trial hearing will be held on February 6. (Edited by V. Graham)
