The construction of a green stadium in Nyamira will start in April, sports executive Grace Nyamongo has said. Nyamongo said the stadium will be built at Esanige community grounds and will be one of its kind in East Africa. She spoke Thursday after receiving contractors, submitting tenders for the work. Late last year, the National Stadia Board chairman Fred Muteti and other officials toured the area. President Uhuru Kenyatta said the stadium will be fully funded by the national government. Muteti said the stadium will have green energy harnessed to all the functions that will be attached to it. The entire grounds will be served with solar-powered installations to be used for energy needs. “We don't have a green stadium yet here in Kenya. But we are going to have one in Nyamira,” Muteti said. The chairman said after the completion,  the design will be borrowed to build other such stadia across the country. This will promote environmental campaigns aimed at lowering degradation and global warming. The stadium will also have technology solutions that will be key in enhancing technology-driven sports. “We cannot continue watching developed countries use video-aided refereeing. We can also bring technology to our playgrounds and use it effectively in advancing the level of our sports,” Nyamongo said. Ten contractors made a pre-tender site visit where they verified the construction location. Nyamongo said tendering process will begin after one and half months after which a successful bidder will be expected to begin the works by April Edited by Kiilu Damaris
