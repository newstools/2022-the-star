President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday evening held talks with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. He also held a meeting with the Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. Uhuru and the host discussed strengthening bilateral ties for the mutual benefit of the people of Kenya and the UAE. Leading their respective delegations at the meeting held at the Sea Palace in Abu Dhabi, the two leaders agreed on the need for Kenya and the UAE to explore the possibility of signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to enhance trade. They also discussed measures to be undertaken to address the trade imbalance that is currently tilted in favour of the Gulf nation. Earlier, the President, who invited Gulf investors to set up shop in Kenya, said the country needed to adapt to what investors wanted and remove the bureaucratic red tape that undermined trade. Uhuru directed Kenyan Government officials to be at the forefront in facilitating trade to give the country a comparative advantage as an investment destination of choice.
