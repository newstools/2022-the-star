If you want to keep your bread fresher for longer, wrapping it in plastic and storing it in the fridge should be the last thing on your mind. Several people have preferred to store bread in the fridge, but science has since proved that it is a wrong idea. Whether homemade or bought from the supermarket, scientists advise that the bread should be stored at room temperature. “The cold temperature makes bread lose their moisture and they end up tasting dry,” Kimberly Baker, Extensions Food Programs and Safety director at Clemson University said as quoted by Southern Living. Apart from that, refrigerating your bread makes it go stale faster. After the bread is heated while baking, as it begins to cool, the starches, which were rearranged when you were baking, begin to regroup to their original state, a process called crystallization. This process makes your bread go stale faster or becomes hard. “Instead of putting in the fridge, remove from the plastic paper and store it in an airtight bread dish, then freeze it,” Baker says. Freezing slows down the process, but defrosting can leave your bread soggy. If you don't want to store it at room temperature, which is the best option, once you remove bread from the fridge, heat it in the oven before consumption.
