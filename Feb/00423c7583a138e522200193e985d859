Turkana South MP James Lomenen has abandoned Deputy President William Ruto's UDA party and joined Treasury CS Ukur Yatani's Upya party. Upya party is affiliated with the Azimio La Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Lomenen, who is eyeing the Turkanagovernor seat, was on Tuesday welcomed to his new party by Yatani and other party officials at UPYA offices in Nairobi. Several North Eastern leaders attended the meeting including Isiolo Senator Fatma Dulo, Wajir south Mohamed Sheikh, Former Garissa Governor Nathif Njama and Former Wajir Governor Ahmed Abdullahi. Party leader Yatani said the party is seeking to engage with other parties from the region. "The dream that we had a few months ago as individuals and communities that were perceived to be on the bridges of the politics of this country are now clear, loud unison," Yattani said. "We are delighted because we are bound by a common agenda not only to empower people but to be part of the social-economic and political process of this country." The Treasury CS reiterated his party's commitment to supporting a Raila presidency. "We are alining ourselves with Raila Odinga because we believe he is going to be the strongest ally who understands the problems of the region," Yattani said.
