Kenya  Morans were torched 105-51 by Egypt in a Group 'D' FIBA Basketball World Cup African Qualifiers in Dakar, Senegal Saturday. The Kenyans, playing their second fixture after falling 66-56 to DR Congo in their first match, had nothing to offer from tip-off as they trailed 25-9 in the opening quarter. The second stanza was more or less the same story as the Egyptians continued to torment them at will, taking a 21-12 edge for a 46-21 half-time lead. The Pharaohs got off the third quarter in style cruising to a 61-26 scoreline mid-way through. They were up 77-34 as the horn sounded. In the deciding stanza, they continued to toy with the  Morans, building a 88-39 cushion with 5:00 to play. They iced it with a three-pointer. Shehata led the rout with 17 points, Amin managed 14 and Anas bagged 12. Valentine Nyakinda was the only Moran to hit double figures, he scored 14. Joel Awich was pulled out injured and Albert Odero was hit with a technical foul late in the encounter. It was not immediately clear if the duo would be available for the next game. Kenya will play host Senegal in their final fixture on Sunday. The top three from each group advance to the next window. In another group tie, host Senegal had a record 20 rebounds from towering center Youssoupha Ndoye as they easily dispatched Egypt 75-57. In Group B, Kuany Kuany shot 18 points as South Sudan made a good debut as they stunned Rwanda 68-56 in their opener.
