Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli has hit back at deputy president William Ruto's director of presidential campaigns communications Hussein Mohamed after he chided him in a statement. Hussein, on behalf of Ruto, had labelled Atwoli's remarks during a Universal Health Care event in Mombasa on Monday as 'unfortunate'. He condemned Atwoli's use of suicide as a form of humour even as he castigated the whole event for allowing such remarks to prevail. "We understand our competitors cannot comprehend because theirs is a coalition of the elite to maintain the privileged they enjoy at the expense of ordinary Kenyans," he said. "Nonetheless to use suicide as humour in electioneering at a national event is a demonstration of just how far these elite are from the realities and struggles of the Kenyan hustlers. The contempt is mind-blogging." Atwoli has now responded to Hussein saying he does not speak for the Azimio movement but for Cotu even as he demanded to be addressed correctly. "Somebody should tell Hussein Mohamed that I am COTU(K), Secretary-General. I have an office and I have no office in Azimio. He should address me correctly if he’s to help JUDA," he said in a tweet on Tuesday. During the event attended by President Uhuru Kenyatta, Atwoli drummed up support for ODM party leader Raila Odinga and trashed Ruto saying he won't be president. "I want to tell those close to Ruto to cut all trees around his home so that he does not commit suicide after the August 9 general elections." Edited by B.Marita
