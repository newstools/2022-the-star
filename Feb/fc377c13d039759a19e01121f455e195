Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria's Chama Cha Kazi party has scheduled itS National Delegates Conference on March 15. The move has raised eyebrows considering Deputy President William Ruto is set to have his NDC on the same date. A notice by CCK party secretary-general Kimani Nage stated that the NDC will be held at the Bomas of Kenya. "Take notice that pursuant to the Chama Cha Kazi party constitution, the National Delegates Convention will be held on March 15, 2022, at the Bomas of Kenya from 10 am," the notice read. The agenda of the meeting includes reviewing, formulation and approval of the Chama Cha Kazi policies and consideration and approval of any other party matters. The DP's NDC will be held at Kasarani Indoor arena on the same day. The move to schedule the NDC the same day as that of UDA has generated a lot of buzz with Kenyans on social media expressing mixed reactions. A section of Kenyans thought the move was to enable Kuria to have an excuse why he will not attend Ruto's meeting. Others questioned whether he will be joining Ruto's camp on the same day. "I see what you did there...... the same date with UDA. Why? So that people won't say you were boycotted like Thika. The obvious reason will be UDA had their meeting too," a social media user Albert Muge stated. Obonyo Majiwa on his part posed: "Then you guys will walk from Bomas to Kasarani Stadium to endorse Ruto as Kenya Kwanza's Presidential candidate?" The UDA party is expected to endorse Ruto for the presidency on March 15, given that nomination of the party's presidential candidate has been listed as one of the agenda. So far, no UDA member has expressed interest in battling out with Ruto for the UDA party presidential ticket.
