Makueni MP Dan Maanzo has come to the defence of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka over bribery allegations indicating that he has demanded money before joining Azimio La Umoja spearheaded by ODM boss Raila Odinga. Maanzo termed the claim by Ukambani Governors, led by Machakos county boss Alfred Mutua, as propaganda. He said the former Vice President has not put any conditions on any political formations ahead of the August 9 General Elections. “The character and conduct of Kalonzo speaks for itself and is above reproach. He is a man who has no single tangible scandal to his name after being in leadership for almost four decades,” Maanzo said. He added: “The vile scheme to perpetuate a hopeless propaganda that the options of Kalonzo are limited to joining Azimio is defective and cooked from the pits of hell.” Maanzo was speaking at Parliament buildings on Wednesday afternoon. The lawmaker also warned Ukambani leaders against making disrespectful remarks against Kalonzo whom he noted remains the undisputed kingpin of the region.
