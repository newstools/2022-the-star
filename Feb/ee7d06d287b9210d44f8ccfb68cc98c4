President Uhuru Kenyatta in a fiery speech on Wednesday delivered an unequivocal endorsement of ODM leader Raila Odinga for president. He told Kenyans DP Ruto was linked to graft and stole project funds meant for the people of Mt Kenya and elsewhere. He donated that money to churches, the President said. For the first time, Uhuru publicly asked his Mt Kenya backyard to strongly support Raila, saying the country would be safer in his hands.
