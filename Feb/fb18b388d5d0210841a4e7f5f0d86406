Rescue operations are in top gear continued to save two people trapped by cane waste at the banks of Keiyan River in Transmara West in Narok county. The pair were covered alive as they turned the smouldering waste , witnesses told journalists . The accident occurred on Tuesday night. One worker escaped from the accident unhurt. He had taken a break to quench thirst when his colleagues were buried alive. "It was a stroke of luck and God's hand as I had just excused myself to take water. I am still praying for my friends to be rescued," he said. By Friday dawn no recovery had been made as emergency teams continued to comb through the debris. An officer said they were rushing against time to see if the pair could still be retrieved alive. The waste stands at about 100 metre high at the bank of  River Keiyan. It blocked water flow along the river when it came tumbling down. Residents told journalists how they sought for help from sugar factory management to move the waste from the area but in vain. They made numerous unsuccessful protests but the firm refused to heed, to their calls. "We have protested many times about this hill of waste, but no measures have been taken,"Daniel Mombish, a resident said. " It's so sad that the factory continues with normal operations without taking care of workers' welfare,"John Olbungei said. The sugar factory management was yet to make a formal statement about the incident by the time of this publication. Trans Mara West police boss Hamisi Ganzallah however said they are working with the management to coordinate rescue efforts. "We will deploy sniffer dogs to help locate the two victims," Ganzallah said.
