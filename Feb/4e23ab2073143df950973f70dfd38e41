More than 200 bishops and pastors in North Rift have said they will remain neutral in the election campaign and focus on preaching peace and unity. The clergymen led by Bishops George Gichana and Mark Kariuki of the Deliverance Church said they would use the pulpit to urge Kenyans to avoid acts that may cause chaos or disunity during the election period. “As churches, our main interest is not to take sides but to ensure peace and unity among our leaders and Kenyans in general as we head to the challenging elections period," Bishop Gichana said. He also urged eligible Kenyans to use the few remaining days to register as voters and be ready to participate peacefully in the August 9 polls. The clergy who met at the Deliverance Church in Eldoret cautioned Kenyans to keep peace and unity despite the highly competitive elections. “This will be a very competitive election but Kenyans should freely elect their leaders while ensuring our country emerges stronger and peaceful from the polls," Kariuki said. Bishops Gichana, Kariuki and John Masinde said the church was sensitising all its clergy to spread messages of unity and peace and pray for the country to remain stable during and after he elections. Bishop Gichana said Kenyans, especially the youth, should register as voters so that they participate in deciding the country's leadership. “We urge Kenyans to use the elections to get good leaders who will serve the country with dedication and not selfishness." They urged leaders running for election not to use inciting language that may spark hostility. The bishops also demanded speedy and thorough investigations into the killing and dumping of bodies of more than 25 people in Yala River. Bishop Kariuki said all those behind the torture and killing of the victims must be brought to book. He said the police should thoroughly investigate and tell Kenyans the truth. (Edited by V. Graham)
