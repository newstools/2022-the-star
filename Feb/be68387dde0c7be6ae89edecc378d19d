Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich, who owns Premier League club Chelsea, has accepted a Ukrainian request to help negotiate an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, his spokeswoman said. “I can confirm Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,” a spokeswoman said. “Considering what is at stake, we would ask for understanding as to why we have not commented on either the situation as such or his involvement.” Abramovich, who is Jewish and has Israeli citizenship, was one of the most powerful businessmen who earned fabulous fortunes after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. The news of his involvement in talks was first reported by the Jewish News which said Ukraine had reached out through Jewish contacts to seek his help in seeking peace. It was not immediately clear what role Abramovich would have in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials which began on Monday at the Belarusian border. Earlier the Ukrainian president’s office said Ukraine’s goal for the talks was an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. The Kremlin has not said explicitly what its aim is in the talks. Elsewhere, German soccer club Schalke 04 said on Monday they were cancelling their partnership with Gazprom GAZP.MM ahead of schedule. “Management and the supervisory board are in discussions with representatives of the current main sponsor, further information will be published in due course,” Schalke said on Twitter. The decision does not affect the club’s financial capabilities,Schalke, who currently play in the German second tier following the relegation in the 2020-21 season, added in a statement. The club had already said on Thursday they were removing the logo of Gazprom from their jerseys following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
