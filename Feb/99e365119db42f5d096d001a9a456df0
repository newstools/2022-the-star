Rogue sleuths attached to DCI Langata have been arrested by Serious Crimes detectives on charges of robbery with violence. The four are said to have abducted a man at NextGen Mall on February 6, 2022, at around noon and forcefully demanded money from him. The detectives said that the victim was accosted by the officers after requesting a taxi by the roadside along Mombasa Road, and was forcefully bundled in a waiting Subaru, that had five occupants. According to the detectives, whilst in the vehicle, the in-charge Corporal Tom Otieno forcefully transferred Sh40,000 from the victim’s Mpesa account to his Mpesa account. They then proceeded to the victim’s apartment where they took a further Sh272,760, from him, before dumping him at Choma Zone located at Total petrol station along Mombasa Road, after a 2-hour ordeal. The following day, the victim went to Akira police station to make his report, only to find the vehicle he had been bundled into parked at the station. He immediately rushed to our headquarters where he reported his discovery at the Serious Crimes Unit. Investigations were launched, and the serious crimes detectives established that the vehicle indeed belonged to DCI Langata. All the four officers who were involved in the criminal act have since been arrested and identified positively by the victim in an identification parade conducted this evening at the DCI headquarters. The suspects are currently guests of the state, facing Robbery with Violence charges, contrary to Section 296 (2) of the Penal Code. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations condemns the unfortunate behavior of the four suspects in the strongest possible terms.
