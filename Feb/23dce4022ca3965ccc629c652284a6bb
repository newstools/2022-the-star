White House press secretary Jen Psaki says banning Russia from the Swift payment system remains an option. "We've never taken that off the table and I'm certainly not taking it off the table today," she said. Swift allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders and links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries.

She responded by saying it's not a time for "equivocation or hiding or waiting to see what happens next" and that any discussions are part of an effort to mitigate the conflict's impact on the global markets. When asked whether China was equivocating, Psaki responded by saying that "every country should think about what side of history they want to be on".
