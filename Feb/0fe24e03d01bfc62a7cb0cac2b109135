The Anglican Church of Kenya is in the process of adopting 3,000 acres of degraded forests for three years to help in replanting trees. The Kenya Forest Service embarked on demarcating and setting aside some 32 sites in different forests in the country measuring 3,000 acres for the church. KFS board chairman Peter Kinyua said the service has prepared a framework for collaboration with the ACK on adopting degraded forest areas for rehabilitation. According to KFS, a bigger percentage of Kenya’s forest was destroyed by loggers many years ago, who cut trees without replacing them. ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit applauded the KFS for partnering with faith-based organisations in replanting the gazetted and ungazetted forests. He said this will achieve the 10 per cent forest cover as envisioned in the government’s Vision 2030. Sapit added that the church will mobilise its followers across the country to participate in tree growing and increase awareness on the importance of forest conservation. “As Anglicans, we shall be guided by ‘Green Anglican Movement’ whose main aim is preserving God’s creation for future generations," he said. "By so doing, we shall be conserving forests, its vegetation, protecting even wild animals, birds and other creatures that depend on the forest for livelihood.” He spoke when he visited Sigiria block in Karura forest on Tuesday, where he was hosted by KFS board chairman and KFS deputy chief conservators Alex Lemarkoko and Charity Munyasia. Kinyua said they have been working closely with faith-based organisations and churches to plant trees in gardens, homes, farms, streets and in the gazetted forests. He said, “Such initiatives create room for people with little knowledge about tree growing to learn about environment and its conservation.” The chairman requested Sapit to build a prayer station at Sigiria forest block where visitors can connect with God.
