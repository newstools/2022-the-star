Traders in Homa Bay town have been warned against cartels soliciting funds with the promise of allocating them stalls in the market. The new Homa Bay Municipal Market was constructed at Sh117.8 million. Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata said on Tuesday they have received information that some people are swindling traders. “Let traders not be hoodwinked and give out money to someone for stalls. We will announce when the stalls distribution begins,” he said. Orata said the government had put proper strategies in place for the distribution of the stalls. He said traders who were relocated to pave the way for the construction of the market in 2019 will be prioritised in the allocation. “The remaining stalls will be distributed to other traders fairly and transparently,” Orata said. The market can accommodate more than 2,000 traders. Orata warned residents against soliciting money from any trader on grounds that they will be given stalls in the market. “Let cartels keep off the stalls distribution because the government is going to do it objectively,” he said. The Homa Bay County Giant Traders Association chairman Geoffrey Okoth Onduso told traders to avoid those peddling rumours about confusion in the distribution of the stalls. Okoth assured the traders, those who were relocated before the construction of the market began will get stalls. “Traders should avoid conflicting information about the distribution of stalls,” Onduso said. The market whose construction began in 2019 has been completed and stalls are due to be distributed. The project was funded by the World Bank through the national government and implemented by Homa Bay Municipal Board. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
