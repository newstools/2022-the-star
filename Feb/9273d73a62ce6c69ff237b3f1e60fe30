On Monday a post making rounds in social media claimed that Ex-Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has thrown his support behind Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Richard Ngatia on his candidature. According to the post, Sonko was hinting at who he will support to become the fourth governor of Nairobi ahead of the general election. “I will announce my stand soon… but on the issue of Nairobi Governship I think Ngatia has already run away with the seat. Tukubali na tuondokee Bazenga achukue hii kitii,” the post read. The fact-checker has confirmed that the post was fake and it did not originate from any of Sonko’s social media accounts, which are all verified. In fact, Sonko had not posted anything on social media since last Friday, with his last post being a picture of a young child sitting on a weighing machine. That is, until on Wednesday morning when the former county boss addressed the issue and termed it fake news. He put up a post in his Twitter account, which is verified with a blue badge, has 1.6 million followers and is following 199 people. “Avoid fake news being peddled around of me having endorsed a Gubernatorial candidate for Nairobi County,” reads the post “I would like to distance myself from such malicious, rumors and false information.I urge my supporters to overlook such kind of fake news as you wait for a major announcement that I'll be making soon."
