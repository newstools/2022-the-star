The political tension is ratcheting up in the run-up to the August presidential, parliamentary and county elections. Unfortunately mudslinging between politicians is becoming the norm.  Criticism is being personalised rather than being based on fact and track record. Mutual personal attacks between the President and Deputy President have not enriched political debate. Not surprisingly, their followers have copied them by insulting their personal rivals and our national leaders. Character assassination of someone as 'reckless', 'ruthless', 'corrupt', 'senile', or 'weak' does not help the voter to make a better-informed choice. Indeed, this mudslinging increases the likelihood of violence around the August election. Insults inflame voters and make them less likely to accept election results, even if that election is clearly free and fair. Politicians should focus on promoting their own policy proposals and track records. And they should criticise the manifestos of their rivals and analyse whether they are viable and affordable. And if they want to directly attack their rivals, let them stick to facts from their careers. It's time for us all to tone down the rhetoric so that we can have election campaigns that focus on policy issues rather than insults.
