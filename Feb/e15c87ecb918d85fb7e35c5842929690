A Garissa court on Friday allowed police to detain three suspects behind the poisoning of Garissa nominated MCA Queen Teresia for five more days. Bernard Katana who was arraigned in court last week appeared alongside Josphine Mbula, the house help. The two allegedly attempted to murder the MCA by mixing her prescribed syrup with a liquid substance suspected to be poison on January 11. A third suspect, Emily Ndunge was also arraigned. Ndunge, who had been on the run since the incident was arrested in Mwingi. The prosecution led by Victor Owuor urged the court to detain the suspect for more days. Owuor said they needed time to get the results of the recovered suspected poisoned substance. He said the liquid had been forwarded to the government chemist in Nairobi for analysis. Chief magistrate Cosmas Maundu granted the request and ordered that the three suspects be detained at Madogo police station until Monday, when their bail request will be determined. Maundu said that the offence being investigated is serious and appears to be complex. He said the five-day period being sought by the prosecution appears to be reasonable. “As much as the respondent are entitled to bond, their constitutional right to bond is not absolute. Bonds can be denied where there are good reasons to do so,” Maundu said. “We find that the report from the government chemist directly affects the direction this case will take. "These are very critical reports and I therefore find that they are a good reason to allow the application. I proceed to extend the custodial order until February 7 when this case will be mentioned in court,” he added. Efforts by the suspects’ lawyer to have the three freed on bond failed.
