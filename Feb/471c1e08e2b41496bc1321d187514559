The weekend is approaching and perhaps you are looking for better ways to spice up that weekend recipe for your kids, friends or family. French toast is my go-to for breakfast or brunch because it is not only convenient with simple ingredients but also it can be prepared in different ways. The name French toast is said to have been used first in the 17th century in England. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Mix all your wet ingredients first, beat the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. Step 2 Mix all the dry ingredients together then combine the wet with the dry to create a batter-like consistency. Step 3 Place your bread into this batter to soak. Step 4 Pour vegetable oil into a pan and set it on medium-high heat. Step 5 After about 20 seconds turn the bread over and allow to soak some more, then add a slice of bread (the soaked ones) and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, until a nice golden brown is achieved. Step 6 Remove from heat and put desired toppings, syrup, and desiccated coconut. Enjoy with a glass of cold beverage with friends and family.
