Kakamega Homeboyz have made an 11th-hour rush to complete the signing of attacking midfielder Gaitan Masha to replace Stephen Etyang who left for Ulinzi Stars. The Kenya Premier League leaders who are enjoying a good run under coach Benard Mwalala, have also finalized the signing of defender Evans Maliachi from Talanta and Mike Isabwa from struggling Vihiga Bullets. Team manager Boniface Imbenzi said Etyang was a key player whose services will be missed. He wished him well in his future endeavours. "Our left-back Thomas Wainana has also been released and signed by Talanta, thus paving the way for new players,” said Imbenzi . “At the moment we have the depth to make us compete effectively for the title. We have managed to acquire three more quality players and we believe we are formidable enough now,” he observed. “We want to appreciate our Chairman Cleophas Shimanyula for the support and the passion he has for the club. We will strive to give our best to maximize on the investment pumped into the club.” He called on their loyal fans to rally behind the team as they bid for their maiden title. Former Kakamega Green Commandos star Evans Maliachi expressed his excitement after joining Kakamega Homeboyz — the club he supported during his days at Kakamega High School. “It's a great honour to get an opportunity to play for this club that is proving to have a great future. I hope to give all my best," noted Maliachi. Homeboyz are currently sitting at the top of the table with 33 points from 16 matches, five above second-placed Kariobangi Sharks.
