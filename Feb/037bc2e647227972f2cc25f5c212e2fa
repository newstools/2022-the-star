President Uhuru Kenyatta's ruling Jubilee party has unveiled a major rebrand exercise, affirming final divorce rites with DP William Ruto. Ruto has irretrievably fallen out with his boss and is engaged in a bare-knuckled political fight over succession politics. The Star has established that the National Management Committee-the party's ruthless organ with unfettered powers- has approved radical changes to Jubilee's outlook. The NCM, which held a close-door meeting on Wednesday, recommended that the party tweaks its colours, symbol and logo. This would signal new dawn without Ruto. This is part of the preparations for a fresh future with ODM leader Raila Odinga's ODM under the Azimio la Umoja. The party's current colours are red, yellow, black and white. The party is doing away with the yellow colour that was derived from Ruto's defunct United Republican Party. Instead, Jubilee is adopting white and red colours that were predominant in Uhuru's defunct, The National Alliance Party. At the same time, Jubilee is changing its symbol to a dove, the symbol that was used by Uhuru's former TNA outfit. The dove will assume red colours in a circled white background. The dove will replace the palm handshake that depicted the marriage between Uhuru and Ruto. Severing the ties with Ruto further, Jubilee has also adopted a new slogan Mbele Pamoja, dumping the Tuko Pamoja one. Ruto is set to officially join his United Democratic Alliance as he seeks to succeed President Uhuru in the August 9 General Election.
