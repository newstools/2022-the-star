Bongo star Juma Jux says doing a video for his song with rapper Nyashinski took a year. The Tanzanian artiste said it had always been his dream to work with Nyashinski. "He is talented and I knew it was not easy to get him, but I was looking forward to working with him," he told Mseto East Africa. Jux said Nyash tweeted, appreciating a song Jux had done, and so he decided to take that opportunity to request for a collaboration. "Immediately, I reached out and asked if we could work on a collaboration. I sent him a DM. He responded and gave me his WhatsApp number, and I sent the verse of the song, 'In case you didn't know', and he liked it." Nyashinski was quick to send his verse after they had agreed upon a song that the Tanzanian artiste had shared with him. "He was impressed and in two to three days, he sent me his verse, but it took a year to do the video," he said. "I was busy and he was busy. We decided to do it at the end of the year. I communicated on the day we would shoot the video. He was not available the day I'm in Nairobi. "Everything was set but he was not available even on phone. I went to look for the outfit but coming back, I found Nyash on the location and all set." Jux said getting him since then has not been easy. 'In Case you didn’t know' is a song with the theme of love. Juma Jux said the song is not just for lovers but for any individual trying to express their love not just to a spouse but it factors everyone in.
