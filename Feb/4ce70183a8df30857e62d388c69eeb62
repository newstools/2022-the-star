Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini is set to miss the Turin derby and the Champions League last-16 first leg clash with Villarreal due to a calf injury, the Italian club said on Tuesday. The 37-year-old was replaced in the 75th minute of a 2-0 Serie A win over Hellas Verona on Sunday. Italian media reported that the Italy international will be sidelined for around three weeks. That would rule him out of Thursday’s Italian Cup quarter-final against Sassuolo, league games against Atalanta, Torino and Empoli, and the European clash in Villarreal. Chiellini has made 16 appearances in all competitions for Massimiliano Allegri’s side this season.
