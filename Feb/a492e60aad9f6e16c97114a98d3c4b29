Gospel DJ Mo turned 36 years old on Sunday. He celebrated his birthday with the less fortunate in society along with his wife, Size 8, and a few friends. Speaking to Word Is, Mo said he chose to do a different thing from the norm to celebrate his friends. "I have done all kinds of birthdays — bashes, travelling, high-end birthdays — and this time, I felt I needed to do it differently by sharing with VIPs in town," he said. "Most of the time, when I'm passing by, they stop me, ask for kitu kidogo, and I told God my birthday, I want to share with them." Mo said they were left in awe by two boys who showed their musical talent. "I also spotted two artistes and we are planning to help them record and see what next for them. That is what I call service to the society." Speaking about what inspired him to go back to the streets, Mo said he used to sleep on the corridor for lack of house rent. "I have slept outside, kwa corridor ya mlango, coz most months I couldn’t pay rent in Githurai 44," he said. "I used to go home very late, sleep kwa mlango, and then leave very early before everyone else wake up. That was around 2005, when life was too hard." DJ Mo is currently one of the successful DJs in the country. His message to those starting up is everyone has their time. "Never give up, focus, push (jitume) and always consult God. Kabisa," he said. " I really wanted to have a beautiful family, car, events company and above all help, someone achieves their dreams or be part of it. "I am pushing up and I want to leave a legacy that I was part of many people's dreams — in one way or another — I played a part."
