Sauti Sol's Savara says the title of his album Savage Levels means unlocking one's potential. He launched it on Tuesday at a listening party. Savara said he initially had a different title for the album but changed it after writing a few songs. "At first, the name of the album was Misunderstood. But when you think of that name, it means you have not unlocked something," he said. "I was timid, but as I was writing...things grew and I started unlocking other levels... getting confidence in things. "I approach it as another level of thinking, you unlock a lot of things about yourself. I have grown unlocking myself, and I want to be an example to a lot of African kids who can unlock their potential and savagery." Who can relate to the album? "Anyone who is trying to be in a good relationship with others. One who relates well with their environment. Many people have potential but lack the savage level to unlock. Savage levels unlock that energy."
