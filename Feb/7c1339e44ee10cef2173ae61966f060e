Church leaders and residents held prayers to cleanse a blackspot  at Matakari along Embu-Kiritiri road on Sunday. On Thursday, one person died while another sustained injuries in a recent spate of accidents at Matakari. The area which is about 500 metres from Embu town, has recorded an increase in accidents, claiming over five lives in less than a month. The clergy said there were demonic forces taking people’s lives. They said there is need to hold prayers and pour anointed oil to destroy the evil power. Pastor John Mukundi of Reigners Church in Embu town, said despite  KeNHA's intervention and residents erecting artificial bumps, the area still experiences grisly road accidents. “As the church, we are concerned over the rising number of road accidents at Matakari. That is why we have decided to cleanse this road through supernatural intervention,” he said. Mukundi said prayers are essential in fighting demons that were causing the accidents and death of innocent travellers. “There are demons here. We cannot have accidents every now and then because that is not normal. We have come to say enough is enough in Jesus name. "We have come here to say demons have no power in this area. We are tired of losing our people,” he added. Rev Eve Kihara of Deliverance Church in Embu urged road users to drive safely. "As a church, we have come here to say enough is enough. We are tired of mourning. God said if there is any calamity, call unto my name and I will answer you. "We are calling our God to intervene and arrest the perennial accidents that are happening hear," she said. Pastor Mugendi Nyaga of East Africa Pentecostal Church, said they will continue praying to keep the accidents at a bay in Matakari. Road users and residents have however attributed the accidents to lack of standard road bumps. They have urged the government to erect enough bumps to deal with the speeding motorists.
