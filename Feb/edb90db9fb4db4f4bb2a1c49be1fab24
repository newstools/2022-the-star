Police in Kisumu have launched investigations into the Nyando Boys High School latrine collapse that left one student dead on Monday. Three other students were injured and hospitalised at Nyabondo Mission Hospital. The latrine caved in on Monday at around 4pm. According to witnesses, four students had gone to the latrine when it caved in. Speaking to the Star on the phone on Tuesday, Nyakach OCPD Daniel Chacha said they will find out whether there was anybody involved in the incident or it was a natural tragedy. Chacha said they are in the initial stage of the investigation. “Investigations are already underway to determine what happened even though it is still not conclusive,” he said. It took the intervention of residents and teachers to rescue three students. However, the fourth student died. Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o, who called for speedy investigation into the incident, said the county government dispatched rescue teams who tried their best to rescue the boy. Former Kisumu county executive member Vincent Kodiera who was at the scene on Monday night, said it is not time for blame games. "We have seen police officers here and we know investigations will be done into the matter," he said. Edited by A.N
