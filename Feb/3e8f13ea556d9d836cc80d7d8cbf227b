Kenya Sevens star Alvin Otieno will make his debut for champions KCB in their rearranged match against Mwamba on Saturday at the Lion's den in Ruaraka. Otieno was signed from Homeboyz RFC during the transfer window in November but could not play as he had commitments with the Kenya Sevens outfit playing at the Dubai, Malaga and Sevilla Sevens tournaments. The match against Mwamba was initially set for early December last year but was called off due to positive Covid-19 cases in both teams. Otieno, who has been a revelation on the global stage will start on the right-wing with fellow international Jacob Ojee starting on the left-wing, replacing Isaac Njoroge and Geoffrey Okwatch. Darwin  Mukidza starts at fullback. Samuel Asati starts at scrumhalf and will link up with Kenya Sevens star Levi Amunga at flyhalf. In the forwards, the bankers s will rely on Oscar Simiyu alongside George Asin and Nelson  Nyandat with the evergreen Oliver Mang'eni starting at lock alongside Brian Munyali. Felix Ojow, Peter Waitere and former Simbas skipper Davis Chenge complete the back-row. The bankers lie third on the log on 31 points and a win will see them jump to second on the log with Menengai Oilers dropping to third. Mwamba will be seeking to bounce back from their shock 31-14 defeat to Impala, which ended any hope of a place in the playoffs. Mwamba coach Kevin Wambua will bank on the experience of Kenya's all-time top try scorer in the World Seven Series Collins Injera in the backs alongside Ronnie Omondi and Joel Inzuga while Salaton Muturi, Paul Opiyo, Eliakim Kichoi and Yayha Hussein will do duty in the forwards. Mwamba are sixth on the log with 14 points. Leaders Kabras Sugar entertain Nondies at the Kakamega showground looking at solidifying top spot ahead of the playoffs. The sugar millers have 35 points while Nondies are fighting for survival, having lost their last four matches to drop to the bottom of the table with just seven points.
