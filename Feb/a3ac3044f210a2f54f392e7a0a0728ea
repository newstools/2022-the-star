Foreign Affairs Chief Administrative Secretary Ababu Namwamba has been appointed to the William Ruto presidential Campaign Secretariat. In a statement on Wednesday, Ruto said the team welcomes his wealth of experience as a leader, lawyer and politician. “We have worked closely with Ababu over the past 10 years on many fronts and I have come to value his leadership, experience, and empathy,” he said. “It is because of those qualities that I could not be more grateful to have him on our campaign team.” Ruto said Ababu will lead the international relations within his presidential campaign. "With his considerable diplomatic talents, deep knowledge of the continent, strong network in the global stage and unwavering determination, I am confident in his role," he said. He said Ababu has a highly impressive profile as a public interest attorney. "...and has previously been active on the international lobbying circuit, strongly, advocating for international human rights and fair trade practices," he said. Ruto said he is 'humbled and fortunate' in continuing to attract, able and distinguished group of citizens to deliver his presidency. Last week, Ababu said he will not contest for any seat but will focus on marketing Ruto’s presidential bid. He said he will not seek to recapture the Budalang’i MP seat. Raphael Wanjala is the incumbent MP. He defeated Ababu in the 2017 polls. Before being elbowed out by Wanjala, Ababu had served as MP for 10 years, between 2007 and 2017. “I have already announced that the Budalang’i parliamentary seat is one shoe that my foot no longer fits. I'm now an international figure and I can’t play in amateur leagues again. I have already declared that I will not contest for any political seat during the August general election,” he said. Ababu on December 31 last year officially declared he had joined UDA. The CAS said he will not support leaders he described as "story tellers". He said that Kenya needs action-oriented leaders like Ruto.
