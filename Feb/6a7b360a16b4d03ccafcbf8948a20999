If you’re a salad lover, then this simple yet incredibly tasty salad dressing is perfect for you. Most salad dressings are usually a mixture of extra virgin olive oil and acids like vinegar. Although other ingredients are usually added to spice things up, enhance flavours, and boost the dressing. This recipe has the same richness and tanginess as a classic ranch dressing but is simpler and with fewer ingredients. The main ingredients for this dressing are jarred pepperoncini and sour cream. All you have to do is mix together 1/4 cup of full-fat sour cream with one tablespoon of minced pepperoncini and two tablespoons of the brine from the jar. Add salt and pepper to taste and stir gently until everything is well mixed. And there you have it, the dressing is ready to be tossed to your favourite salad or any other meal you love to drizzle it over. Note: if you don’t have sour cream or pepperoncini in the house, you can use whole milk Greek yoghurt and crème fraîche as substitutes. For pepperoncini, you can substitute them with dill pickles or pickled jalapeños. Use the same amount of the substitute ingredients as you would the main ones and you’ll have a perfect drizzle for your salads and meals.
