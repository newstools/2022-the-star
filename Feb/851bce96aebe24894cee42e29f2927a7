Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege wants Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to reschedule her 'vote rigging' case citing health conditions. Through her lawyers James Orengo, Otiende Amollo and Martin Aloo, the lawmaker asked for another date saying she is unwell and admitted to Nairobi Hospital. The case was scheduled for hearing on Tuesday morning before IEBC's Electoral Code Conduct Enforcement Committee. Otiende tabled the letter from Dr Eric Munene confirming the lawmaker is unwell. "Allow me to introduce a letter to confirm that the respondent is indisposed and was admitted on February 16 at Nairobi Hospital," Otiende said. He added: "We request that we reschedule the hearing to when she will be available." The Rarieda lawmaker also informed the Committee that they had moved to the constitutional court to get an interpretation on whether the committee chaired by IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati had jurisdiction over the matter. The Committee adjourned for 15 minutes to consider the issues raised by the defence team. The Electoral Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee last week summoned Chege over her utterances regarding the 2017 presidential outcome. While urging residents to register in large numbers as voters so that they can vote in ODM leader Raila Odinga to be the fifth President, Chege ended up saying:  "Kule central nimeskia hapawengine wakisema hapa tuliwaibia, kuna kaukweli kidogo. Lakini mjue kama tulijua kuiba si ata hii tutafanya nini...alafu…alafu." The utterances were made at a public rally in Isibuye in Vihiga County on  February 10, 2022, during the Azimio la Umoja Movement mobilisation rally. Edited by B. Oruta
