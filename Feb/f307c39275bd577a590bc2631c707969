When you are picking green beans, here is a tip, you might think bigger is better but go for thin sturdy beans. They should be able to snap quickly and easily, otherwise, you will lose that sharp, fresh green bean flavour. Green beans are highly nutritious as they are high in Vitamin K and B. The nutrients are good for maintaining healthy bones and they have a decent amount of calcium. Green beans are a great source of fibre and folic acid, which is beneficial for pregnant women. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a large sufuria or pan heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook garlic 30 seconds to 1 minute or until fragrant.
