The Oman-based duo of Ariel Okal and Fidel Okoth will miss today's Kenya Morans FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 African Qualifiers opener against DC Congo. Coach Cliff Owuor in an interview from Dakar, Senegal, revealed that Okal and Okoth, who plies his trade for Ahli Sidab have yet to arrive in the West Africa city. "They did not make it as expected and are not here with us. The earliest they are expected is after our opening match today," said Owuor. "This now means we will go with ten players. But they will be available for our next match." Kenya meet Egypt tomorrow and host Senegal on Sunday. Morans left for Dakar on Wednesday without an out-center as Rwanda-based Tom Wamukota and Desmond Owili, who is in Australia are unavailable. Owuor said he will use France-based Joel Awich and local-based players Valentine Nyakinda and debutant Job Byron, to do the job. "I will have to rotate Awich, Vale, and Job for this position.  Despite the handicap at the post, I am sure the boys will give it their best shot," said Owuor who handles APR of Rwanda. Kenya are in Group D alongside Egypt and Senegal. In Group B Africa champions Tunisia, Cameroon Rwanda, and South Sudan will be battling it out. Algeria, Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Nigeria, and Tunisia are the only teams that have represented Africa at the World Cup.
