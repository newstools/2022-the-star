The Azimio La Umoja movement has started enrolling Embu delegates. Chairman Andrew Ireri, who is also the Embu Nyangi Ndiiriri cultural group chairman, said Raila Odinga's movement aims at identifying delegates who will represent Embu county at the negotiations table. Ireri spoke during the launch at Runyenjes on Monday. The chairman said they will sign delegates based on equal representation of gender and special groups. “Each subcounty is supposed to enroll five delegates consisting of all groups in the society to represent the county nationally,” he said. Ireri said Azimio aims at giving a fair share of development once it clinches power in the next general election. He said those who will volunteer in the steering positions will play a negotiations role. The chairman said their duty will be to ensure Embu receives ambassador positions, parastatal heads and to seek solutions on challenges facing different areas of the county. “I welcome you all to unite and have a written memorandum to our president who is in charge of appointing major positions. "We want to end the narrative of leaders hosting discussions elsewhere without involving citizens. We don’t want to be directed on who to elect without the knowledge of our share as a county,” Ireri said. The chairman said President Uhuru Kenyatta should come out clear and tell the people of Embu what they stand to benefit in the next government. “The President is endorsing Raila and calling on us to elect him, let him come and tell us what they have in store for the people of Embu,” he said Ireri also said that Uhuru should consider giving jobless youths the positions vacated by those resigning to join politics. The chairman said the positions will expose them to master governance. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
