President Uhuru Kenyatta has defended ODM leader Raila Odinga’s actions in the past after the general elections, saying that the system is the one to blame. Speaking in Kasarani during the ODM NDC, the president said if Raila was a man of war, he would not have agreed to form a coalition government with former President Mwai Kibaki. While praising Raila for the bold move that he took to work closely with him, the president denied the claims that they were after his succession. “Let me tell you, it is not Raila who is a man of war, because if he was a man of war, he would have resisted any attempt of peace between him and President Kibaki. If he was a man of war, he would have resisted any attempt of making the Handshake happen,” Uhuru said. He continued that: “What is the truth I that what creates violence is the system of governance that we have had in place of the winner take it all and having the other communities feeling like they have been left out of government.” He said that since Handshake, a lot of government projects have been successful. The president added that at no point did Raila prefer himself for the August polls. Uhuru revealed that he partnered with Raila to have his government agenda at parliament sail through. "The person who will ensure that system of governance to be inclusive is non-other than Raila Odinga."
