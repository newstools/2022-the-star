Tanzanian musician Diamond Platnumz is being criticised online for featuring a Confederate flag in the video of his latest hit song. The Confederacy was the group of southern states that fought to keep slavery during the US Civil War - and the flags are seen as divisive and a symbol of racial tensions in the US. One of Diamond's video scenes in the song Gidi has two of the flags displayed as he dances while donning a cowboy look. Some tweeters have reacted to the musician's video. "The Confederate flag in your video is disturbing," a user wrote. "Confederate flags?" Clyde Blaise tweeted while adding a dustbin emoji.
