Residents of Matunda Village in the Kiminini sub-county have held a peaceful demonstration over increased cases of livestock theft in the area. A section of them marched to the chief's office to present their petition after torching houses of suspects believed to be behind the cattle rustling. They accused the local police of failing to apprehend a notorious gang of thieves that has terrorized them for a long time. "We are asking the Trans Nzoia county security team to tame these thieves who seem to be well connected to security officers," said a resident who sought anonymity. The residents said in the past few days, they have been spending the nights in the cold to guard their animals against the daring thieves. Some of the locals claimed that they were forced to keep their cows in their main houses for fear of being robbed. According to them, their reports at Matunda chief’s office which is manned by critical infrastructure police unit officers CIPU has not born any fruit. Matunda location acting Chief Sammy Yaola condemned the torching suspects' houses and warned those behind the act of arrest. "It was only better for victims of cattle theft to record statements to allow the police carry out investigations than resorting to hooliganism," he said. The administrator said police had launched investigations into the matter. “Residents have failed to volunteer vital information to net the culprits. Their silence has made it very hard for the administrators to follow up on such cases,” he said. Birunda ward representative Martin Jamanoor said locals cannot continue to lose their livestock and asked the police to handle the matter once and for all. "Instead of taking the risk of torching houses of suspects and later on being hunted by the police, I would rather encourage you to seek better ways to get justice through legal means," he said.
