Sweden, Finland and Denmark said they were preparing to close their airspace to Russian planes on Sunday (Feb 27), joining a string of European countries taking this measure after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The moves follow similar closures of airspace of Britain, Poland, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Romania to Russia's aircraft. Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are also closing their airspace to Russian airliners, while Germany said it was preparing to do so. Iceland has also decided to shut its airspace to Russian air traffic, Icelandic Foreign Minister Thordis Kolbrun Gylfadottir tweeted on Sunday.
