Over 60 people have died in the last four years due to the Kala-Azar disease in Ngomeni, Mwingi North subcounty, MCA Eliud Mutati has said. Mutati said the deadly disease is caused by the Leishmania parasites spread by sandfly bites and usually affects the spleen, liver and bone marrow. He said the sandflies are found in camel grazing areas and when the desert animals invade parts of Ngomeni that border Tana River in search of pasture, the flies then bite the residents. Its symptoms are swelling of the liver or spleen, fever, weight loss, among others. However, despite the area being so vulnerable to the sand-fly bites, the MCA said dispensaries are not equipped with the required medicine. He said treatment in private facilities is very expensive and most residents cannot afford it, hence most of them end up dead. “We plead with the county government to equip our dispensaries and evict camels from our peoples’ farms for peace to prevail,” the MCA said. He said following the invasion, there is conflict as residents and camel herders fight for pasture and water. “We call on the national government to solve this misery, it has left most families devasted for losing their loved ones,” Mutati said.
