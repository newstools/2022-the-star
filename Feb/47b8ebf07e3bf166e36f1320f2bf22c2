Makueni governor Kivutha Kibwana has welcomed the One Kenya Alliance leaders to the Azimio La Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. In a statement on Sunday, the governor said Oka leaders namely Wiper party's Kalonzo Musyoka and KANU's Gideon Moi are allowed to join Azimio la Umoja. He, however, cautioned the leaders to be wary of early birds who have been supporting the Azimio movement from the onset. "As Chairperson of the South Eastern Economic Bloc (SEKEB), and my two governor colleagues Dr Alfred Mutua, Charity Kaluki Ngilu and the Ukambani people, we welcome OKA into AZIMIO. "The grand vision is genuine unity to save and prosper Kenya, not to share positions. Let the new entrants honour the Early AZIMIO Birds," he said. Reports of OKA leaders sealing a deal with Raila's Azimio have been rife recently after the ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi together with Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula ditched the outfit and joined deputy president William Ruto's camp. Kalonzo has however maintained that he is in the race to the ballot as a presidential candidate.
