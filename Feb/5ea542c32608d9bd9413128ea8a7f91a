Baldev Chager, winner of both the first mini classic rally in 2018 and the 2021 edition, eclipsed American driver Ken Block to finish day two of the East African Safari Classic at the summit. The Kenyan speedster assumed the lead with a total cumulative time of 05:04:58.8 to top the chart. Day two of the World’s Greatest Classic Rally started off in Nakuru County and finished in Nanyuki, Laikipia County covering a distance of 451km. The 47-year-old in his trademark Porsche 911 endured the rough terrain to beat a strong field of 42 competitors after 5 of them retired from the initial list of 48 drivers. The Kenyan-born driver attributed his win to local knowledge of some of the routes with which he is quite familiar. “We’ve been consistent and not far off top three, I think we’ve found reasonable balance and ready to enjoy the race,” he added. Day 2 of the rally saw the drivers traverse a wider area of Laikipia County in the areas of Ol Kalau, Moguni, and Loldaiga. The teams will also tackle a few of these stages tomorrow. 39-year-old Swedish national, Patrick Sandell, in his Porsche 911 came in the second position with a total cumulative time of 05:07:06.0. Third place was taken by Ken Block whose total cumulative time was 05:08:56.2, despite experiencing a tyre puncture along the way. The day also saw a number of highlights such as Carl Tundo of car no. 2 retiring at the first stage, and car 18 of Jean-Michel Martin also pulling out. Also bowing out were car 46 of Nish Lakhani due to mechanical issues and car 36 of Iain Dobson. The 10th edition of the East African Safari Classic Rally is sponsored by Victoria Commercial Bank, Standard Group, A&K, Safaricom, NTT Dimension Data, Kenya Tourist Board, Aquamist, Vivo Energy and East African Breweries Limited.
