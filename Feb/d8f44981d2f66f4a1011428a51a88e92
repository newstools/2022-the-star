Chess Kenya president Bernard Wanjala will seek a second, and final term, during the federation's elections set for February 13. The incumbent, who will face off with Judith Kiragu Mwashe, says he wants to leave a legacy by completing the vision he had for the sport when he first assumed office. “I will be running for the second and last term to take Chess Kenya to the second phase of transformation. I invite you to join me in this journey. "My goal is to leave a legacy that I will look back on and be proud of. I want to transform chess in Kenya and touch many lives of chess stakeholders,” he said. Wanjala believes his record speaks for itself despite the challenges he has encountered. “To oversee the transformation of this great institution was one of the hardest tasks in my life.  I was lucky to have worked with a great team that gave their life to CK and went an extra mile to ensure we succeed in our vision,” Wanjala said. He paid tribute to other officials and staff at CK who have helped him steer the sport to higher levels. “In this journey, we had those who sat on the fence as they watched things unfold and we had those who chose to do nothing but focus on mocking the progress we have made. At the end of the day, we are all one family,” Wanjala said. Other members of Wanjala's team who will be contesting for other seats include Andrew Owili (vice president), Gilbert Wandera (treasurer), John Mukabi (secretary-general), Rodah Etole (gender and special interest secretary), Ivini Magoica (national branch secretary), Terence Chazima (deputy treasurer) and Aurelia Chumo (deputy secretary general).
