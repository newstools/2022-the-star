Remarks by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua on Depuy president William Ruto's choice of deputy have met resistance. On Monday, Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala told MP Gachagua that the Kenya Kwanza Alliance was not after dividing Kenya into regions. Gachagua had earlier said that Deputy President William Ruto's running mate will not come from Western Kenya but from the Mt Kenya region. In a statement, Malala said no deal had been reached yet, by the co-principals of the alliance –Musalia Mudavadi, William Ruto and Moses Wetang'ula. "At our level, we will engage with the likes of Rigathi Gachagua because we are not Presidential Aspirants," he said. "We strongly believe that Kenya Kwanza is an idea that Kenyans want. We are forgoing a coalition that will liberate Kenyans from the hands of a few leaders who don't care about the well being of the ordinary Kenyans." The senator called for calm, insisting that once their co-principals return from their trip abroad they will speak for themselves. Earlier, Mudavadi had said the MP has no powers to speak for Kenya Kwanza Alliance. "Rigathi Gachagua has no authority to speak for Kenya Kwanza on the matter hence his sentiments are premature, untimely and unwarranted," he said. Mudavadi insisted that the alliance had not decided on its presidential and running mate candidates. Speaking on Monday morning, on Citizen TV,  the Mathira MP said Ruto’s running mate will come from the Mt Kenya region and the deal was already sealed. Gachagua said Mudavadi and the Kenya Kwanza leaders were aware when they were joining the alliance. "We have our NDC on March 15 to unveil our candidate William Ruto and other things will follow," he said. "But as far as I'm concerned Ruto is a presidential candidate and the running mate will come from the mountain at an appropriate time."
