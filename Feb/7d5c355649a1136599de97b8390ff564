It was a normal Tuesday afternoon, the weather was not too hot nor cold, but all that changed in seconds. Kenyans were caught unaware after a heavy downpour followed by massive hailstones rained in the city. Many Kenyans were not prepared for the heavy downpour forcing them to either buy an umbrella and brave the rain or find a hiding place before the storm calms. Boda Boda riders waited for clients under their umbrellas within the CBD as the rains caused massive traffic. Some areas like Westlands experienced flooding due to the heavy rains and poor drainage systems. Most parts of the country have experienced heavy rains, days after the weatherman announced that heavy rains could fall over much of Kenya between March and May. The Nairobi-based IGAD’S Climate Prediction and Applications Centre said most of Kenya is likely to receive above-normal rains, except the eastern strip along the Somalia border where rains will be normal.
