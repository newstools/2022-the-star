ODM leader Raila Odinga has said that the ODM party should consider a consensus in the selection of 2022 aspirants. Speaking at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi during National Governing Convention, Raila said if there is no consensus they should go for an opinion poll, if that fails, then the other two, delegates and voting can be considered. "Opinion poll is very scientific and it is done all over the world. You don't have to rely on one pollster, you can use two," he said. According to secretary-general Edwin Sifuna, the party is relying on four methods to pick its candidates which are; consensus, direct ticket, delegate system and voting. “We are looking forward to implementing a system that will ensure communication and feedback to encourage a more consistent and connected approach," he said. The mode of picking 2022 aspirants has triggered heat in ODM with bigwigs clashing over various proposals on how to settle on various candidates who will fly the party flag on elective seats. ODM Director of Elections Junet Mohamed wants the party to issue direct tickets for candidates in the 2022 elections. The Suna East lawmaker told a meeting of the NGC to amend the nomination rules to scrap the contested primaries that have led to unnecessary cutthroat competition in the outfit. "The issue of the nomination is one of the biggest problems our party has suffered from," Junet said. "If a candidate is identified scientifically, let the National Elections Board be mandated to give them a direct ticket." The proposal was supported by Kisumu governor Anyang' Nyong'o. According to Prof Nyong'o, the direct ticket is the only way to cushion the party from unhealthy competition from small Parties. "I hope after this NGC, this proposal should be pursued and implemented to protect us from these small parties which disappear immediately after the election," he said. Kisii Woman Representative Janet Ongera, while supporting the proposal, warned against the abuse of the scientific method.
