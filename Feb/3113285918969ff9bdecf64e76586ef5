An anti-corruption court has directed Ann Ngirita to be placed in custody until she can find another surety to stand for her in the Sh468m NYS graft case. Magistrate Eunice Kagure made the order after one Stephen who had given out his property to stand as surety for Ann chose to withdraw the same. Kagure said surety is a voluntary act and the Court lacks the power to force anyone to continue acting as a surety. The development comes a week after Ngirita announced a bid for the Nakuru women rep seat. She made the announcement after joining the ruling Jubilee party where she was welcomed by party officials in Nakuru. Her entry into politics sparked reactions forcing the party to issue conflicting reports. Nakuru officials addressed a press announcing that Ngirita must seek clearance first before being fully welcomed while the party's secretary-general Raphael Tuju dismissed reports that it had rejected her.
