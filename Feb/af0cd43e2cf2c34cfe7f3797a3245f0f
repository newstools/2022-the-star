Deputy President William Ruto will on Wednesday take his Kenya Kwanza campaign to Ukambani region. The second in command will woo the lower Eastern region to vote for him in the August 9 polls. Ruto will be accompanied by his Kenya Kwanza Alliance partners, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya). During his visit, the Deputy President will make stopovers in Subati, Kavuthu, Uvete, Kalawani, Athi River and Mlolongo areas, where he will address residents. Last week, Ruto was on a tour of the larger Central Kenya region. His main challenger, ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Wednesday meet leaders from the South Rift region. The meeting will be held at his Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Foundation offices. This comes after the conclusion of the former PM's four-day tour of the Coast region. He is also expected to attend the meeting dubbed 'Sagana 3' where President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to meet leaders from the Mt Kenya region.
