Agriculture CS Peter Munya has vowed not to join Deputy President William Ruto's UDA camp, even as pressure to have him vie for Meru governorship intensifies. Munya supporters have been asking him to join the governor race to unseat Kiraitu Murungi. The CS, however, said he'd rather lose an election than join Ruto’s camp. He spoke on Monday while drumming support for Azimio La Umoja Movement. The former governor said only ODM leader Raila Odinga’s presidency can revive the economy and create jobs. “No parent dreams of educating their children and later buys them a wheelbarrow to push. We do not hate wheelbarrow pullers but wish them growth business-wise. "The philosophy sold by Ruto’s camp of Kazi ni Kazi is similar to retired President [Daniel] Moi’s Mkae hivyo hivyo. He is a good student of Moi,” Munya said. However, the CS said there is high likelihood the intense lobbying for deputy president position may be fruitful. Munya was accompanied by North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood and his South Imenti counterpart Kathuri Murungi at ASK Gitoro Showground. The CS said Azimio roots for peace and development for a sustained economic growth and creation of jobs. Munya said countries like Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam that were at par with Kenya economically have stable economies whereas Kenya’s economy collapsed. He said corruption and mismanagement brought down the economy hence the ballooning debt. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
