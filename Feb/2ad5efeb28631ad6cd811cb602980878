Justin Harding will be among the star attractions as he plots a return to defend the coveted Magical Kenya Open title at the par 71 Muthaiga Golf Club course. Harding was in fine form last year when he held on to his overnight lead to win his second-ever European Tour title at the Kenya Open by two shots with a 5-under 66 in the final round. The South African will be hoping for a repeat performance of 2019. During this period, he won the European Tour after settling for  Commercial Bank Qatar Masters by two strokes. The following week, he was a joint runner-up at the 2019 Kenya Open,  a result that lifted him into the world top 50 and gave him an entry into the 2019 Masters tourney, where he finished 12th  to earn his place at the 202o Masters Also in the mix is Italy's Guido Migliozzi who won the first European Tour at Karen in 2019 when he fired a final round 69 to claim the coveted title by a single shot from Adri Arnaus, Louis De Jager, and Harding. Migliozzi was just playing his 14th European Tour event then and will be among the players to watch at Muthaiga this week.  Another star coming for the Kenya Open is last year’s Kenya Savannah Classic winner Daniel van Tonder. South Africa’s van Tonder has lots of memories for Kenya after claiming his maiden European Tour victory at the Karen Country Club course last year when he defeated Jazz Janewattananond with a tap-in birdie on the third playoff hole. In December 2021, van Tonder won the SA Open Championship; the Sunshine Tour's flagship event. The European Tour has been renamed the “DP World Tour”  from this year after they became the new title sponsor of the group’s main tour this season.
