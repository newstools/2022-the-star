The Mombasa County Assembly on Wednesday passed a motion to block motorists from parking in its precincts. According to the MCAs the car park is being used by outsiders. The parking is shared by staff of the deputy county commissioner's office, Kadhi’s court, municipal court, governor and deputy governor and the county treasury. They claimed that the private vehicle owners use the space to avoid paying charges, hence denying the county revenue. In the motion tabled by Likoni MCA Athman Mwamiri, the MCAs want the entire parking space designated for them and the public offices nearby. Mombasa has 42 MCAs and more than 100 supporting staff. “Members are facing a lot of challenges in getting ample parking space as they attend to their duties in this House,” Mwamiri said. He said the ‘invaders’ have been occupying the parking space as early as 6am, denying the MCAs a place to station their vehicles. “In many instances, members are forced to park elsewhere. This has been happening because we don't have regulations to control our parking area,” he said. The session was chaired by the Assembly Speaker Aharub Khatri. MCAs resolved that the County Assembly Clerk will mark and name reserved parking for each MCA, nominated members and staff. The County Inspectorate Department was also ordered to control the parking space. “Any private vehicle, which does not belong to an MCA, County Assembly staff or employees from the nearby government office and visitors to the Assembly, will not be allowed to use the parking lot," Mwamiri said.
