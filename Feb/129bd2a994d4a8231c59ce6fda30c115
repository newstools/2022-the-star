Kitui county assembly speaker George Ndotto has urged MCAs to be diligent and uphold integrity so as to go down in history as the most outstanding assembly. “I encourage all members to carry out their mandate with utmost integrity,” Ndotto said. He spoke on Tuesday as he officially opened the sixth and last session of the second Kitui assembly ahead of August polls. He said when history is written, the second Kitui assembly should stand out by the number of bills, motions, regulations, petitions and statements deliberated and approved. Ndotto added that the legislators should also strive to be remembered for impressive legislative work that helped improve the lives of Kitui residents. “We have been given this opportunity on behalf of the residents of Kitui and I am certain beyond doubt that we shall deliver,” he said. Ndotto pledged to continue to guide the MCAs on the best way to achieve the general good. This, he say will be through championing the improvement of the economic and social wellbeing of Kitui people and its leaders. He further reminded the MCAs that the end of the current session would ultimately open the gates to the August general election. “We are all aware that the general elections shall be held exactly seven months from today, on August 9. “As elected leaders, I urge you to take note of the important dates provided by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission,” he added.
