Comedian Eric Omondi will support friends who aspire to join politics but he will just stick to being a 'drama queen' in the entertainment sector. Speaking to Word Is, Eric said politics is not his cup of tea. "Never ever in my life will I join politics. If I go to Parliament, who will entertain you outside here?" he said. "God made musicians, comedians, politicians, doctors.... He knows why he did that. Eric Omondi is an entertainer. It is like asking Raila to get into comedy. "I am going to support my friends Jaguar, Jalang'o. I have given them an ultimatum, I will support them and when they start joking, I will ensure they leave Parliament before five years." Eric promised to cause trouble for his friends if they do not meet the expectations of voters. "I will sign the petition to have them removed," he said. The comedian also spoke on the recent police raid at the home of his boss and presidential aspirant Jimi Wanjigi. "It was sabotage, it was a witchhunt. I was in court and there was no case. They just woke up, took Land Rover, guns, and went to raid. Even Wanjigi was surprised with what was happening," he said.
