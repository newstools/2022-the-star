Insurance and investment company Vitality, one of the West Ham football sponsors, has said it has suspended its partnership with the club with "immediate effect" over a video of Kurt Zouma hitting a cat. The company said it is disappointed by the club's decision to play Zouma despite having committed the offence. "We are hugely disappointed by the judgement subsequently shown by the club in response to this incident," Vitality said. "As such, we are suspending our sponsorship of West Ham United with immediate effect. We will now be further engaging with the club to understand what actions they will be taking to address the situation." This comes even as West Ham released a statement saying they have fined Zouma the maximum amount. The Independent report that the player has been fined 250,000 euros, roughly Sh32,479,720. Zouma, who along with his brother apologised for his actions, was dropped by sportswear giant Adidas on Wednesday. "We have concluded our investigation and can confirm Kurt Zouma is no longer an Adidas contracted athlete," the company said in a statement. Another West Ham sponsor, Experience Kissimmee, said it was considering its position with the club. The Florida-based tourist organisation said it was "disheartened" that Zouma played in the Premier League match. Zouma was booed by supporters at the London Stadium on Tuesday and former England captain and now BBC presenter Gary Lineker, said the decision to play him was "tone deaf". French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet condemned what he called "a gratuitous, stupid and nasty act of violence" and said he hoped Zouma drew a lesson from the situation. In a further development an online petition to have Zouma prosecuted has been signed by 165,000 people. Essex Police have said they are investigating the incident. The West Ham Supporters' Trust (WHUST) said it "condemns the actions" of Zouma with chair Sue Watson saying the club should have taken a "moral stance" to leave him out.
