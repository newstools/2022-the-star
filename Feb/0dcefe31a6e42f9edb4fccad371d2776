Fly 748 has given the Kenya Police a boost to promote good relationships with the public through sports after signing a one-year sponsorship deal valued at Sh6 million. While signing the cheque in Nairobi on Tuesday, Fly 748 Managing Director Moses Mwangi said the sponsorship will enhance police efforts to reach out and improve ties with a much bigger population in their bid to strengthen community policing. The signing and handover of the cheque was done at Jogoo House. “As part of our CSR, we are much interested in sports sponsorship because it brings people together, and what a better team to partner with than the people who take care of us, who are in charge of security,” Mwangi said. Mwangi added that security and safety are cardinal in the aviation sector. "Everywhere we fly to, the first people we meet are the police. We are very excited to partner with and sponsor Kenya Police FC.” The sponsorship will also extend to subsidizing air tickets for the football club. Deputy Inspector General Edward Mbugua said the sponsorship has offered Kenya Police a huge relief from a big budget required to cater for all its sporting activities including hockey, Karate, and Tae Kwondo. Mbugua added that sometimes they can only afford to give these teams lunch and that the deal came in handy. “The team is doing good competing with big teams having been its first time in the premier league. We expect to see good results by the end of the year. We don’t expect to go back to the super league, we want to remain in the premier league,” Mbugua said. 748 Air Services Chairman, Ahmed Jibril an ardent supporter of local football clubs wished the Kenya police club the best in their forthcoming matches and missions of promoting community policing.
