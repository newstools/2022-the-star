Former national champions Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) face a tough task as they welcome Equity Bank in a crucial playoffs semi-final Game Three tie in Mombasa. The porters, who lost the opening two games (64-54 and 78-66) in Nairobi last week, must win at their backyard if they harbour any hopes of progressing. "We have to win Game 3 to keep our hopes alive. I agree it is a tricky situation but I believe we can turn the tables," offered KPA tactician Sammy Kiki. Another game at the Makande Welfare hall will see top-seed KPA women (2-0) up, tackle the visiting Storms. The dock women walloped Storms 79-33 and 89-61 and remain favourites to reach the final. A confident coach Anthony Ojukwu said he has not lost a match at home and does not expect to do so any time soon. The Nairobi fixtures have been moved to Sunday due to the unavailability of the Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium. Reigning men champions Ulinzi Warriors play Strathmore University Blades. The soldiers are 2-0 up after winning 78-54 and 79-69. "We have done a review of Game 2 and we now know where we went wrong. We hope to make amends in Game 3," said Blades' Tony Ochieng. The other semis of the day will see defending champions Equity Bank Hawks take on Zetech University Sparks. David Maina charges are also ahead with 50-45 and 66-58 wins in what remains the closest games of the series. "We want to maintain our focus as we did in the last two games.  We will go all out to try and get the series over on Saturday," said Maina. Wins for Blades and Sparks will see the series move to Monday and if necessary Tuesday for Game 4 and 5 at the same venue.
