The Federal Party of Kenya on Wednesday unveiled Francis Ominde as its new party leader. This was after the exit of Andrew Kutilila who joined DAP-K, which is led by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. Kutilila has been at the helm of the party since 2013. While speaking during the event in Mbale town, Vihiga county, Ominde said FPK is the only party that will ensure good leadership in devolved units. “FPK is the only party that will ensure credible service delivery to our counties and for that to be achieved, we must have good governors and sober MCAs across all the counties,” he said. “FPK is not in any coalition at the moment. We want to focus on local politics in all counties as a way of preparing the party for national politics,” he said. The party is set to field candidates for MCA, MP, senator, Woman Rep and governor seats countrywide. Edited by A.N
