Stanbic Bank Kenya and UN Women have partnered to promote the growth of women in the workplace. This will be done through the UN Women’s empowerment principles (WEPS). The WEPS are a set of standards that provide businesses with guidance on how to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace and community. According to 2021 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) data, it showed that women accounted for 61.9 per cent of the jobs lost in 2020. “Our commitment to women is reinforced by our It Can Be brand promise which drives us to empower and invest in individuals and help reach their potential,” Chief Executive, Stanbic Bank Kenya, Charles Mudiwa said. Five of the seven principles adopted by the bank include high level corporate leadership principle, treat all women and men fairly at work without discrimination, enterprise development, supply chain and marketing practices, community initiatives and advocacy and measurement and reporting. UN Women Kenya country representative, Anna Mutavati said their objective is to deepen, broaden and strengthen their private sector engagement to help shift behaviours for gender responsive business conduct.
