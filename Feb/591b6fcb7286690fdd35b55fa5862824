United States recently proposed a massive cut to its annual funding for Kenya’s HIV programmes. The US President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) complained Kenya has become one of its biggest beneficiaries since 2003 but is doing too little to increase domestic funding to fight HIV. This year, Pepfar said it will cut its funding to Kenya by Sh2.27 billion.
