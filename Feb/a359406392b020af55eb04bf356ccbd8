Suna East MP Junet Mohamed has denied allegations by former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar that he scored a D in KCSE. In response to allegations made by the former Senator, the MP took to his Twitter to respond and defended his academic record. "You know very well I went to Lenana and you left ahead of me.. but two things never happened... One of them is I didn’t get a D," he said. Both Junet and Omar are alumni of Lenana School. Former Senator Omar had released a video castigating Junet and claiming that he failed in his KCSE exams. Omar was reacting to a scuffle where Mvita MP Nassir Abdullswamad Sheriff was pelted with stones at a Mombasa rally held at Tononoka grounds where the ODM leader Raila Odinga was present. It is during his reaction that he faulted Junet and even claimed that he performed poorly in his KCSE exams "Tulikua na wewe Lenana Abdullswamad alifuzu akapata B-, mimi nikafuzu nikapata A-, wewe vipi ukapitie Lenana upate D buana. Unafikiria kuwa mshirika wa Baba nikupata akili?" he said in the video recording. Loosely translates to: " We were with you at Lenana school, Abdullswamad passed his exams and got a B- (Minus) and I too passed after scoring an A- (minus). How comes you got a D and you went through Lenana. You think being Raila's supporter is being clever?" The two leaders were members of Raila's camp but Omar moved out after he was trounced by Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho in the 2017 polls. He had vied for the governor seat on a Wiper ticket under the NASA coalition led by Raila. After losing the polls he campaigned for President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election in the repeat polls. He later joined hands with deputy president William Ruto and became one of the founding members of the UDA party. He will be seeking the governor seat in the 2022 polls on a UDA ticket. Junet on the other hand has become one of the few trusted Raila's loyalists in the ODM party. He will be defending his Suna Est seat in the August 9, polls.
