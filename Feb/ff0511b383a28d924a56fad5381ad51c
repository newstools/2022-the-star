Digital Strategist Dennis Itumbi on Thursday visited Boniface Makokha, the man who rescued him, in Lucky Summer, Karasani, after his alleged abduction four weeks ago. Makokha is the taxi driver who took Itumbi to the hospital on the day he was said to be abducted. He said he was driving home when he noticed a naked man by the road whom he recognized as Itumbi and decided to help. "I was headed home when I saw a naked man talking to bodaboda operators and on close inspection, I saw it was a man in distress and I offered to help," he said. He took Itumbi to his house, bought him a drink, covered him in a bedsheet before taking him to hospital. "The respect I have for Mr Itumbi and my cultural values could not allow me to take him to hospital naked," Makokha said. Itumbi was in the company of friends during the visit. They presented a few gifts to Makokha. Itumbi thanked him for the selfless act and pledged to pay his rent so that he can focus on expanding his hustle. "I must admit if it were me driving and came across a naked man at that hour I would have hesitated to stop. For you to stop and listen to my predicament and took me to the hospital is beyond the call of duty. You are one selfless man," said Itumbi. On Sunday Itumbi will have a thanksgiving mass at his Gichugu constituency home church to celebrate his narrow escape from the hands of his alleged kidnappers.
