Government has launched the first-ever Competency Based Curriculum classroom block at Waa Girls High school in Kwale county on Monday. According to the county director of education Martin Cheruiyot some 79 other classrooms are 50 per cent complete and will be ready in six weeks’ time. "We expect to complete the rest of the classrooms before the Form 1s come," he said. The classroom was commissioned by county commissioner Gideon Oyagi on behalf of Education CS George Magoha. The director said the contractor is moving at unmatched speed, adding that various buildings are at different levels of completion. Cheruiyot commended the contractor for exemplary work saying half of the target had been achieved within the set timelines. In Kwale, at least 23,000 learners who are yet to transit to Grade 6 are expected to join junior secondary schools next year. About 24,000 others who are currently in Standard 8 will also be joining Form 1 in 2023. According to Cheruiyot the completion of more classrooms will facilitate easy transition and smooth learning for both the junior secondary and high school students. "We are happy that the government is determined to set the infrastructure required for a conducive learning environment because we really need them," he said. Oyagi lauded the education stakeholders for cooperation in helping government achieve development goals. He, however, urged the contractor to fast-track the completion of the rest of the classrooms for the government to meet its intended objective in time. The commissioner called on the parents to cooperation and support government in delivering the new education curriculum.
