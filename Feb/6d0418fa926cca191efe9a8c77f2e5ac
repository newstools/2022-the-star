Senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi is of the opinion that deputy president William Ruto must unveil his Mt Kenya running mate the day his boss Uhuru Kenyatta hits the ground to campaign for Raila In a Saturday statement on Twitter, the celebrated lawyer said the DP has no option than take the move which he says will serve him good in countering President Uhuru's forays. According to the Lawyer, whose political statements largely favours the DP, the move will earn him the support of the Mt Kenya region wholeheartedly. "DP Ruto must unveil his running mate from Central Kenya the day H.E Uhuru starts his open campaigns for Hon Raila in Central Kenya. "The people will hear the competing voices of their former leader (H. E UHURU) and that of their future leader...and you won't have a contest!" he said. His remarks come in the wake of reports that President Uhuru is set to start campaigning for the opposition chief whom he has been courting since the March 9, 2018, Handshake. The step comes even as the Jubilee PG meeting held on Friday resolved that the party should not field a presidential candidate. Jubilee party and ODM party is expected to hold a joint meeting either on February 25 or 26 which will culminate in endorsing Raila for the top seat. Uhuru's fallout with his deputy has seen him reportedly plan to ensure that Ruto fails to clinch the presidency. The Head of State told the Jubilee PG on Friday that the curtains have been raised for politics considering he has delivered on his manifesto. He pledged to revive the Jubilee party and ensure that its candidates clinche elective seats.
