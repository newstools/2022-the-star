Elgeiyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has hit back at President Uhuru's move to endorse ODM leader Raila Odinga as his successor. "The most important decision we’re going to make is a country that chooses their leaders. There was enough time that you should have fought Ruto in 2013," Murkomen said. "Get out of our way. Let us fight with the person who wants to be president. Uhuru should go on holiday and leave us the candidate to deal with him. You’re looking so bad and desperate." He spoke on Saturday during Ruto's tour in Mumias East in Munganga, Kakamega County. President Kenyatta has rolled out an aggressive campaign to woo millions of youth voters across the country in an effort to deflate the influence of his deputy William Ruto. The President, who has stepped up to vigorously take charge of his succession battle, has lined up a series of meetings with young people as he seeks to turn the tables on Ruto. The DP is seen to have the upper hand among the youth, a population he has branded as hustlers and victims of longstanding trickle-down economic policies. On Friday, Uhuru held a meeting at State House Nairobi with hundreds of youths from Central Kenya counties as he kicked off his mission to woo the youth. The meeting was attended by young people drawn from all the Mt Kenya counties including Nakuru, Laikipia, Meru, Nyeri, Kiambu, Nyandarua, Murang'a, Embu and Tharaka Nithi. The President is said to hold similar meetings in the coming weeks in Nyanza, Coast and Western in a deliberate campaign to deny Ruto the crucial constituency.
