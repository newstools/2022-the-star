FIFA has suspended Kenya from all international footballing activities with immediate effect. The ban was because of government interference in football. Also suspended for the same reason is Zimbabwe. “We had to suspend two of our member associations — Kenya and Zimbabwe. Both for government interference in the activities of the football associations of these associations," FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. The suspension is indefinite. The ban means Kenya will not participate in all international football competitions. The local football tournaments will, however, proceed. Fifa president Infantino said Kenya knows what to do to get back in action. "They know what needs to be done for them to be readmitted or for their suspensions to be lifted." The decision was fuelled by the government's move to suspend Kenya Football Federation and replace it with a caretaker committee. Spots CS Amina Mohamed is now between a rock and hard place as she needs to put the country back on track as far as the international competition is concerned. Her move to disband the FKF committee, arrest of former FKF president Nick Mwendwa after disbandment and appointment of the caretaker committee have been billed as reasons for the ban. The CS had been directed to reinstate the previous committee but she did not heed the directive.
