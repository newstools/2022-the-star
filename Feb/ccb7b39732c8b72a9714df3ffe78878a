An unknown number of militants who were in the company of the four escaped with multiple injuries. No KDF officer sustained injuries during the raid. "KDF troops under Operation Amani Boni have intensified patrols in the locality and will continue, along with other security agencies and support from local residents to pacify the area in a bid to get rid of al- Shabaa terrorists," the Defence Ministry said.
