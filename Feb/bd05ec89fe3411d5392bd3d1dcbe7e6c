ODM party leader Raila Odinga has accused William Rutos's UDA of plotting to reject results of the upcoming August 9 elections. Through his campaign Secretariat press secretary Dennis Onsarigo, Raila said the party has sensed defeat and has now resorted to incitement and violence. "We are convinced that the grouping led by the Deputy President sees enemies and ghosts wherever it looks, the worst is yet to come," Raila said. "The grouping is out to seek an alibi for their planned action after losing the polls in August. The merchants of violence and intimidation of this country are known, there is a dangerous plot by the grouping to force Kenyans to vote for it and its candidates or face the unspecified consequence." The former Prime Minister said Ruto's party is spewing violence in its sentiments both in public rallies and private meetings. "They are also determined to undermine the sovereignty of the Kenyan Nation and its people by capturing power through any including unconstitutional means," he said. "We demand that the Deputy President and his party make a straightforward undertaking to respect the will of Kenyans from a peaceful process and gently move to the opposition benches without shedding innocent blood."
