Popular prophetess Monicah Nyambura was forced to explain why she is not posting her husband after fans inquired. In 2018, she went down the aisle with Samuel Kariuki and later had a son, Wisdom Jabari. In the two years they were together, Monicah would post their photos online, especially during her pregnancy. Around September 2020, she stopped posting his pics and stopped wearing her wedding ring. Speaking to Word Is on Sunday at the launch of Size 8's Gospel Anthem album, the mother of two said life happened. "It could happen to all of us but life has to go on," she said, adding that she is happy. When cornered to speak about her husband, Monicah evaded the question but spoke about her thoughts on divorce. "Divorce is bad and even God hates it, but I can say it depends coz, you will not beat me up, wield a knife at me and throw me and do all those things, call me names, and I am just there," she said. "I don't like divorce and even those who have divorced, you ask them, they will say, they don't like it." She said it is the dream of all couples to make marriage work. "When I get to a marriage, I get there to make it work and there is an age where you say, for better for worse in that marriage. But you cannot die in the name of marriage or the name of a husband," she said. "The opinion of people does not matter. The peace of mind is all that matters. If I am happy the way I am, then let me be, don't wait for me to die so that you can come to my funeral to cry, saying you wish she did this and that." She added that at times, divorce is bad, traumatising, emotionally, physically and even spiritually. "But if it is the best decision, we need you alive. If there is violence, leave than die. You are needed by so many people."
