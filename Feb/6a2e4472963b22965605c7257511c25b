Nzoia Sugar have boosted their squad with two new signings ahead of Saturday's Kenyan Premier League clash against second-placed Nairobi City Stars. Newly-appointed head coach Salim Babu confirmed the signing of stopper Salim Sudi and forward Peter Emoni from Kisumu All-Stars and Posta Rangers respectively. The duo signed a two-year contract with the struggling millers. Babu reunites with the players who played for his former employers, Kisumu All-Stars. Sudi left the Blue Eagles in the current transfer window while Emoni, the 2021 National Super League Most Valuable Player, left last season for Posta Rangers. However, he failed to replicate his form at Posta Rangers. Babu said he will work on getting the best out of Emoni. “He is a player I have worked with before and I’m confident he will rediscover his form and help us,” said Babu. He will compete with free-scoring Levis Okello who is the team’s current top scorer. “The competition will help Emoni. He is a hugely talented player,” said Babu, a former defender. Babu praised defender Sudi saying they needed an experienced player and a leader in the backline. “We have a very young and talented squad. If you look at the goal we conceded against Kakamega Homeboyz, it was due to the lack of an experienced player at the back. Sudi will fill that gap,” noted Babu. He praised his charges for holding Kenya Premier League leaders Kakamega Homeboyz to a 1-1 last weekend. He is targeting a win against second-placed Nairobi City Stars. “The boys gave their all during the Homeboyz game. On the game against City Stars, we are targeting a win,” said the tactician.
