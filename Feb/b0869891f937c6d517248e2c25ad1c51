Deputy President William Ruto will on Monday camp in Busia County as part of his scaled-up efforts to have the region solidly behind him. Ruto will be leading the Kenya Kwanza alliance campaigns alongside Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula. Kenya Kwanza will begin its engagements with the people at Malaba  Border and later at the Achuneti Stadium in Malaba Town. Ruto will also make stopovers in Nambale,  Butula and Mubwayo Grounds in Budalangi. The trio is on a three-day charm offensive of the Western region which began in Vihiga on Sunday, during Mudavadi's homecoming. They will be accompanied by a host of sitting and aspiring MPs allied to them. ODM leader Raila Odinga's campaign remains suspended while he is on a 10-day trip abroad. The former prime minister departed on Friday for a series of meetings in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the 35th ordinary session of the assembly of the African Union heads of states and government. Raila, who is the AU special envoy on infrastructure, will then fly to India for an undisclosed purpose. The ODM leader is a known associate of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
