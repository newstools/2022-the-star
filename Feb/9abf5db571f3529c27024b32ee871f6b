Esther Henseleit is back to defend the Magical Kenya Ladies Open title she won at the Vipingo Ridge course in 2021. The German lady professional has been invited to the Order of Merit winners' category alongside South African lady star Lee-Ann Pace. The event scheduled for February 10-13, will count towards the Ladies European Tour. Hensleit, who turned 23 on January 14, earned her maiden Ladies European Tour win at the 2019 Magical Kenya Ladies Open in Vipingo. During the event,  she bagged both LET Order of Merit and LET Rookie of the Year awards thus becoming only the third player after Laura Davies in 1985 and Carlota Ciganda in 2012 to achieve the feat. She will be among the players to watch in Vipingo Ridge which is incidentally Africa's only PGA-accredited golf course. Henseleit turned professional in January 2019 (with an EGA handicap of +7.1) after finishing third at Qualifying School for the 2019 Ladies European Tour. She won the Skaftö Open on the LET Access Series and qualified for the 2019 U.S. Women's Open at a sectional qualifying tournament. Pace, on the other hand, is regarded as one of the best players on Tour having made her breakthrough in 2010 with five wins at the Deutsche Bank Ladies Swiss Open, the S4C Wales Ladies Championship of Europe, the Finnair Masters, the Sanya Ladies Open, and the Suzhou Taihu Ladies Open. She ended the season at the top of the Order of Merit and won the LET Player of the Year. Meanwhile, the Kenya team for the LET Magical Kenya Open will comprise four amateurs and one professional.  Naomi Wafula and Mercy Nyamchama will lead the charge for the amateurs alongside 14-year old Chanelle Wangari of Vet Lab and Faith Chemtai of Nandi Bears. Nyali lady professional Bhavi Shah who played in the 2019 event hopes to make amends after failing to make the cut last time.
