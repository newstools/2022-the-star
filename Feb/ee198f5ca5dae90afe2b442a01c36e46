ODM leader Raila Odinga has left the country for a week-long trip to Ethiopia and India. Raila's spokesperson Dennis Onyango in a statement on Friday said the former Prime Minister is scheduled to attend the African Union's 35th Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The two-day event will take place from February 5 to 6. "In his capacity as the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa, Mr Odinga will hold Infrastructure related events and meetings on the sidelines of the Summit," Onyango said in the statement. Raila met with former Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn Boshe before he took his flight to Addis Ababa. After the summit, Raila will head to India before returning to Nairobi.
