A Bungoma-based health lobby has been meeting with health officials to find ways to improve maternal and child healthcare in the county. The Bungoma reproductive, maternal, neonatal child and adolescent health network is a coalition of civil society organisations and media working in the county. Public health practitioner and champion in Bungoma Stephen Yambi said they want to ensure maternal and child healthcare is scaled up across the county to reduce maternal deaths. He spoke to the Star after a two-day workshop with county health officials. "We are keen on primary healthcare services because it is one of the Jubilee government’s Big 4 agenda. I appeal to the county department of health to support us," Yambi said. Vivian Nasimiyu, the network organising secretary said the main aim of forming a health coalition in Bungoma is to help in sensitising expectant mothers in the community and encourage them to visit health facilities for antenatal care services. She said since November 2020, antenatal visits have increased from 48 per cent to 57 per cent. “The network has representatives from across the county where members go around in their areas of jurisdiction to sensitise pregnant mothers in remote areas to visit health facilities for antenatal care,” she said. Nasimiyu said they work closely with community health volunteers. “Good perinatal health is vital,” she said. Nasimiyu said at the height of Covid-19, high number of teenage pregnancy cases were recorded in the county. “We are also on course to fulfil President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big 4 agenda of ensuring residents are accessing quality healthcare,” she said. Nasimiyu said the group has hosted several meetings with county health officials to urge them to invest more in the sector. Edited by A.N
