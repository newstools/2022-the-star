Maina made the remarks during an aspirants’ meeting organized by the party’s national elections board (NEB) in Bomet on Thursday. “We do not need to be afraid because all the risks have been identified and we tackled it during the planning stage and NEB will ensure there are enough ballot papers showing images of the candidates so that no one feels it has been photocopied in a kiosk of a cyberspace,” she added On his part, the party’s NEB Chairman Anthony Mwaura assured aspirants that no candidate has been awarded a direct nomination certificate. “UDA is different from other parties in the manner in which we do our things. We stick to our rules and procedures and we have all agreed with the aspirants on how we are going to manage our nominations,” said Mwaura.
