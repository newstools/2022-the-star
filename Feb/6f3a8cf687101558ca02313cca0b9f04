A new way to prepare that cake using leftover yoghurt and lemons that are stocked up in your fridge. Yoghurt replaces the milk and its creaminess helps keep baked pastries moist while the lemon adds in extra flavour. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat the oven to moderate180 to 160 degrees. Grease the baking pan and set it aside. Step 2 Mix together in a bowl, the butter, rind and sugar, adding an egg at a time until light and fluffy Step 3 In a large bowl, transfer the mixture and add coconut, wheat flour, lemon juice, self-rising flour and Yoghurt. Combine evenly. Step 4 Spread the mixture in the greased pan and bake for 50 minutes Step 5 In a pan over medium heat, combine the lemon rind, squeezed lemon juice, water, honey and cardamom until the honey melts. Remove from heat and discard the cardamom pods. Step 6 Pour the syrup over the hot cake after baking. Sprinkle desiccated coconut for extra flavour. Step 7 Refrigerate or cool, then serve up and enjoy over a cold cocktail.
