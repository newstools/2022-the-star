The Party of the National Unity (PNU) on Thursday resolved to support the presidential candidature of ODM party leader Raila Odinga in the August 9, polls. The party that swept retired President Mwai Kibaki to power in 2007 made the declaration on Thursday during the top organ meeting at Bomas of Kenya. "The Party resolved that PNU joins the Azimio La Umoja Movement for the purpose of 2022 elections," read part of the resolution. Raila was accompanied by Narc party leader Charity Ngilu, former Westlands MP Fred Gumo and ODM Secretary General Edwin Sifuna. The opposition chief had earlier attended Cyrus Jirongo's UDP NDC at Multimedia University.
