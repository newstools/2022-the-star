The Busia government on Friday inspected ongoing construction works at the Cross Border Fish TranShipment Market in Burumba ward, Matayos subcounty. The project is a collaboration between the county government and the World Bank through the Kenya Devolution Support Programme (KDSP). It is primed to be a leading market for fish traders in Busia county and the larger East Africa region. The team from Public Works, led by acting director John Kevin Otwani, set the project status at 98 per cent with the remaining finishes likely to take a week to complete before it is handed over to the Agriculture and Fisheries department. Among the features that would be in the market is a cold room, an eatery point, storage point, fresh fish handling section and offices. “The market generates Sh1.2 billion in trade, but with the completion of the new facility, the figure will rise to Sh2 billion,” he said. The office of the governor was represented at the meeting by service delivery director Shadrack Maloba. Maloba lauded the contractor for accelerating the completion of the project, which was among the priority projects under Governor Sospeter Ojaamong’s administration. Fish traders, who were represented by their chairperson Tabu Aketch, thanked the governor for constructing the facility, which they said will go a long way in boosting the fish trade in the region. Aketch and more than 700 traders, who will manage the day-to-day running of the structure, suggested that the facility be named Ojaamong Fish Transshipment and Auction centre in honour of the governor. The facility will have eateries, fish cleaning areas and ablution blocks which will be managed by traders through their leadership. The contractor promised to complete the remaining work in a week’s time before handing it over to the county government.
