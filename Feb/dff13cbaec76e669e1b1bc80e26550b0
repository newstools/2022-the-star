Deputy President William Ruto is on Sunday expected to lead Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders in a mega rally set to be held at Vihiga cultural grounds. The rally will be hosted by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. The rally is the first for Mudavadi and Kenya Kwanza leaders at large since the group agreed on partnering ahead of the August 9, elections. On January 23, Mudavadi agreed to work with Ruto even as he said working with ODM leader Raila Odinga is not his option this time around. Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula is expected at the rally as the two seek to bring together the Luhya nation and rally them behind Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The team is facing fierce opposition from the DAP-K party that is allied to Raila's Azimio La Umoja Movement. Several Western leaders allied to Kenya Kwanza are expected to grace the event. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala and a host of leaders on Saturday toured the hosting ground and confirmed all was set. "This evening, I inspected the ground preparations of the Vihiga Cultural Grounds ahead of the Sunday 6th February, Kenya Kwanza Alliance mega rally, Vihiga circuit," he said. The Azimio team is yet to make public its itinerary for Sunday but the ODM leader is out of the country for private business. The Azimio team on Friday held a parallel rally to that of the Kenya Kwanza which had pitched a tent at Tononoka grounds in Mombasa. The rally was led by Mvita MP who is eyeing the county's governor seat.
