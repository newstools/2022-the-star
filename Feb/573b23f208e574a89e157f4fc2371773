Four people have been killed in an IED attack in Sangailu, Holugho sub-county in Garissa county on Thursday morning. The four dead were part of 6 people who were in the vehicle that was travelling from Masalani to Holugho when the incident happened. The tragedy happened between Bura East and Galmagala. The driver of the vehicle narrowly escaped death and is fighting for his life in hospital. Another passenger sustained minor injuries. The four dead were family members. Among the dead was the Holugho water officer who was going to inspect a water site in Muftu. Speaking to the Star on phone, former Holugho sub-county administrator Abdullahi Yarrow, who is a relative to the four, said the four will be buried today (Thursday) in accordance with the Islamic rites. On Wednesday,  Northeastern regional commissioner James Kianda urged residents to cooperate with the security apparatus to improve security. Garissa leaders also urged residents to be more vigilant and report any suspicious persons to the authorities. Their appeal comes a week after suspected terror attacks in Mandera and Wajir counties. Some 11 people lost their lives in the IED attacks. The leaders cautioned residents against hiding or collaborating with al-Shabaab members. They said in the end, the terrorists will turn against them and their people.
