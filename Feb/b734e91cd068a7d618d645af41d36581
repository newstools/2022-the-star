A Ruiru-based foundation has offered to provide free lunch to all candidates sitting for the KCPE examinations in Ruiru. The Simon Ng’ang’a King’ara Foundation will feed some 3,000 candidates from 18 primary schools in the subcounty. MP Simon King’ara who is also the patron said the programme is aimed at enhancing the candidates’ preparations as well as motivate them. King’ara spoke on Wednesday at Mwiki Primary School in Githurai while launching the programme. He said most of the candidates come from humble backgrounds and only get a single meal in a day. “Not every candidate enjoys two meals in a day and that’s why we decided to help them by providing free lunch so that they can concentrate on their examinations,” King’ara said. Already, cooks who will be preparing the three-day lunches for the candidates have been hired. The candidates will enjoy rice, meat and chapati as well as fruits. King’ara said more than 600 candidates at Mwiki Primary School are set benefit. The lawmaker said the institution grapples with inadequate facilities to comfortably cater for the 4,500 pupils and the teachers. It is however, one of the best performing public schools in Kiambu county. “The school sits on a land smaller than a football pitch and has a myriad of challenges including less classrooms, lavatories and desks. But its candidates beat all these odds and excel in their examinations,” he said. The legislator said the government has put up two new schools in the area. The move aims to decongest the school adding that plans to put up more classrooms in the school are in the offing. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
