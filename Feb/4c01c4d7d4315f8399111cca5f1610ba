Deputy president William Ruto is the leading presidential contender based on the number of campaign rallies held so far. As he aims at his first stab at the presidency, Ruto is seemingly giving his best shot. His campaign messaging is premised on the bottom economic model that he says will help in uplifting the lives of the poor Kenyans. It is in that economic model that a number of his campaign promises are pegged on.
