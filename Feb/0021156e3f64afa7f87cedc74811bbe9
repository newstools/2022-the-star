Shops and markets are closed amid a three-day shutdown in the city of Bunia in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo to protest over this week’s massacre at a camp housing those who've had to flee their homes because of inter-ethnic conflict. More than 50 people were killed, many by machetes, in an attack on Plaine Savo camp blamed on the militia group Codeco. Its fighters are mainly drawn from the Lendu farming community, which has been at loggerheads with the province’s Hema cattle herders. Apart from a few pharmacies and health services, Bunia - home to about one million people - is like a dead city. “We will endure this closure up to Saturday to mourn and sympathise with survivors of Savo massacre, and we want to show our concern,” a resident told BBC Great Lakes. A civil society activist said the shutdown was organised because people are angry and feel very vulnerable. “The government is not doing enough to protect us,” Dieudonné Lossa told the BBC. “We are being killed every day, in a place where there are the UN forces deployed.” He added that the Congolese and Ugandan armies were also working in partnership in the region, yet people in Ituri province - where rebel groups proliferate - felt like they were living in a “state of siege”. On Friday morning, just outside the Plaine Savo camp - where an estimated 20,000 people live - a funeral service was held, with long row of coffins in front of the mourners. "This is the fifth deadly attack on a displaced people’s camp. We have buried a lot, we are now tired of this war," Mr Lossa said.
