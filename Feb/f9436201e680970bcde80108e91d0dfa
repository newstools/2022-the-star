A man has been arrested after assaulting a woman during a political rally in Kisii County. Joash Atemba Nyang'ate aka Sokoro was caught on camera assaulting a lady who shouted Azimio at a UDA rally in Kisii on Thursday. During the rally, the Kenya Kwanza leader had asked the crowd to respond 'kazi ni kazi' when prompted. But instead of responding that 'Kazi ni Kazi', the lady responded 'Azimio la Umoja'. It was at this point that Sokoro slapped the woman on her cheek making her turn around. Sokoro then pretended to have not slapped the woman. In a statement on Friday, National Police Service police boss Hillary Mutyambai said the man has been arrested. "Police in Kisii have acted on the incident and made an arrest. He is in police custody assisting with the investigation and will face court action once the investigation is completed," Mutyambai said. He advised the public to exercise restraint and accommodate divergence of opinion during the electioneering period. "This is to mitigate on instances of lawlessness and breach of the peace," he said.
