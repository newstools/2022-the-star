DP William Ruto will take his hustler movement to Kakamega county as ODM’s Azimio goes to Busia county. Ruto will arrive at Mumias East in Munganga on Saturday where he is expected to address a rally and later go to to Navakholo Centre. He will address a rally at Amalemba Grounds, Kakamega town at noon. The team will storm the heart of Kakamega county and epicenter of Luhya politics where among other declarations, defectors from other parties will join the alliance. Ruto’s hustler movement has been selling their bottom up model in the two counties of the larger Gusii region. Ruto, who was accompanied by his allies, made at least five stopovers, to sell his agenda to the locals. On the other hand, Raila’s brigade will be spearheaded by ODM deputy party leaders Hassan Joho and Wycliffe Oparanya in Busia. The team pitched a camp in Vihiga County in what is seen as a move to counter the Kenya Kwanza alliance that has been crisscrossing the Western region to woo voters to support them ahead of the August 9 general elections. Azimio's leader Raila Odinga who was abroad for his 10-day tour is expected to return to Kenya this weekend.
