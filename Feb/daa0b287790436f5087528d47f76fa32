Deputy President William Ruto will on Wednesday take his Kenya Kwanza campaigns to Murang'a County. The second in command is expected to woo voters to support his presidential bid. Ruto, who will be accompanied by Kenya Kwanza coalition partners, will make stopovers in Kahaini, Kaburugi, Gaichanjiru, Kaguku and Kenol to sell their Bottom-Up agenda to voters. Murang'a County seems to be of very high interest to the DP and his main challenger Raila Odinga. This comes a few days after Ruto officially launched the second phase of the bottom-up consultative meetings in Nyeri. The Azimio Mtaani brigade will, on the other hand, take their campaigns to Makueni County on Wednesday. The group led by Mombasa Governor will pitch the Azimio la Umoja gospel as well as drum up support for ODM leader Raila Odinga, as he seeks to become the fifth President of Kenya. This will be the former Prime Minister's fifth stab at the presidency. Azimio Mtaani in Makueni will be a continuation of a series of rallies across Nyanza, Western and other regions. The team has so far visited Vihiga, Busia, Homa Bay, Laikipia and Migori counties. The team has kept Raila's campaigns going even in his absence. The former PM left the country for a 10-day trip in Ethiopia and India.
