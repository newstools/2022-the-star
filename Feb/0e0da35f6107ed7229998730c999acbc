 Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has warned that the big guns working on a coalition to fight DP William Ruto will be "slaughtered' if they lose the polls. The Pan-African Alliance party leader said the Azimio-One Kenya coalition must do whatever it takes to win the August 9 general election. "Kama hili kundi halitakuwa state house jua kwamba tutaisha,  hatutakua na amani," Kingi said at KICC. This is loosely translated to: "If  this group here will not be at State House, we will be in trouble together with you." Kingi is among over eight parties that are attending the Jubilee National Delegates Convention at the KICC.
