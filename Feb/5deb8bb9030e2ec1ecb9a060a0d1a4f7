Four Kisumu governor aspirants who teamed up and promised to front one candidate have started campaigns to popularise their unity. Kisumu Senator Fred Outa, East Africa Community CAS Ken Obura, former Governor Jack Ranguma and former Kisumu Assembly Speaker Onyango Oloo held their inaugural rally at Karanda Primary School in Nyando subcounty. The four, who said their mission is to fix the mess in the county, read their resolutions to their supporters after a church service at ACK Kisumu East Diocese. "Among us here, we have the next Kisumu governor," Oloo said. Obura said rice and sugarcane farming, which is the main economic stay of the area, has collapsed and farmers have been neglected by the current administration. "There's no support at all for our rice farmers, same with sugarcane farmers. The county ought to have developed policies to assist farmers in getting a market for the produce,” he said. Former Governor Ranguma announced that during his reign, he negotiated for World Bank funds that were used to refurbish Kisumu CBD. "In 2015, I travelled to New York to sign a deal for a grant that Governor Anyang' Nyong'o is now taking pride in," he said. The team said their candidate will be named in a fortnight. In the meantime, they say they will be going round the county with a message of hope in new leadership. Governor Nyong’o is serving his first term after defeating Ranguma in the 2017 general election. He is going to defend his seat in the ODM party. Edited by A.N
