Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala on Thursday sparked speculations when he endorsed Deputy President William Ruto for the presidency at a time when Kenya Kwanza Alliance is still deliberating on its flagbearer. In a statement on Facebook, Malala candidly said the Western region will vote Ruto raising eyebrows whether ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi had reneged on his promise to reach the ballot. Malala is one of Mudavadi's ardent supporters who played a crucial role in his entry to Ruto's camp. "Western Kenya region is fully behind William Ruto as the next president of the Republic of Kenya. We have voted for Raila Odinga enough times and we have nothing to show for it as a region. It's time to change the players in the game.," Malala said. The remarks caught the attention of Kenyans who thronged to the comment section questioning whether Mudavadi had bolted out of the race. "So now it's not Mudavadi for president. You said to do or die MDVD will be on the ballot. What changed?" Joe Ogalo posed. Another Malala follower Isayi Fritz stated: "Ooh now I see. So it's no longer about mudavadi and Ruto facing off for the ticket?" After ostensibly taking note of the buzz the post had generated, Malala edited it to include the name of Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula. "Western Kenya region believes in the leadership of Hon. Musalia Mudavadi, H.E. the Deputy President, Dr William Ruto and Sen. Moses Wetangula to form the next government of this republic. "We have voted for Raila Odinga enough times yet we have nothing to show for it as a region. It's time to change the players in the game," Malala stated without clarifying an earlier post. Mudavadi who launched his presidential bid on January 23, has gone mum on campaigning for his bid even as he accompanies the DP at rallies. The ANC leader has recently perfected the art of disparaging ODM leader Raila Odinga and President Uhuru Kenyatta even as he appeals to Kenyans to back Kenya Kwanza. Edited by B. Marita
