Singer Juliani and Lilian Ng'ang'a have officiated their marriage. The two held a private wedding on Wednesday at an undisclosed location in Kiambu county. Lilian was dressed in a baby pink flowing wedding gown and Juliani had a snow-white t-shirt with an ivory jacket, Dark-coloured pair of trousers and white sneakers. Juliani had three groomsmen while Lilian had two bridesmaids who wore shoulder lavender gowns. The wedding theme colours were white and black. The total invited guests were less than 50. Lilian celebrated the wedding day by sharing a photo of her face beat photo wearing a cute ivory gown. She captioned the photo; "Happy and grateful to be alive to see my favourite #2 looking soooo aligned! ~ 2.2.22 ~" Close friend, Boniface Mwangi on his social media posted; "Tumengara and the mission is unknown. But for now, we live life," adding, "Life is beautiful and music is life." A source who spoke to Word Is on condition of anonymity said: "The couple seems to want to keep this out of the media glare and keep away from the subsequent drama it brings. So, I cannot confirm or deny if they got married or not." In a past interview, Lillian told Nation Africa that Alfred wanted to wed her. "In August 2021, Alfred Mutua told me he will give me a white wedding and have my father walk me down the aisle. He told me to choose a date even if it was in a week’s time." Lillian did not agree. She still left the relationship and even returned a brand new land cruiser the governor bought her the same month. The former first lady maintained that their union was never formalized officially, meaning they were not married. She said the governor only visited her home for introduction but was yet to move to the next stage where dowry is paid.
