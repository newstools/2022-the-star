The Party of National Unity be has given notice to hold a National Delegates Conference on Thursday ahead of grand launch of Azimio la Umoja party. The notice to all PNU delegates signed by secretary general John Okemwa and chairman David Kamau says a special NDC will be convened on February 24 at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi. “The agenda of the meeting shall be to discuss and ratify coalition building and the party’s working relationship with other like-minded political parties and related matters,” the notice says in part. It will be the first public function the warring factions in PNU will be holding since President Uhuru Kenyatta brokered an end of hostilities between groups loyal to Laikipia governor Ndiritu Muriithi and those aligned to Agriculture CS Peter Munya two weeks ago. President Kenyatta’s intervention is reported to have persuaded Munya and Muriithi factions to quit fighting and cooperate, and rally their supporters behind the Azimio La Umoja movement. It will also be the first official PNU party function ODM leader Raila Odinga is expected to attend since he and PNU founder and retired President  Mwai Kibaki exited the Grand Coalition government. The two factions had been flexing muscles over control of the PNU machinery that has been most vibrant in helping ODM leader penetrate the Mt Kenya region. PNU leadership were among the first to embrace the Building Bridges Initiative. They were also the most visible in organising public rallies and tours for Raila in the mountain region at a time majority elected leaders claimed “to be listening to the ground” before making their position known. PNU took a step further to consolidate working cooperation with with Raila when it signed a working agreement with ODM in October 2021.
