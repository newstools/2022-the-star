Rev Natasha says haters fabricate stories to make it look like she and her husband perform fake miracles. Speaking to Lynn Ngugi on YouTube, Natasha and her Indian husband said people will say anything on social media. "They pick things and fabricate stories out of nowhere," she said. "We call people to the altar for different reasons. Just because I prayed for you last week does not mean I will not pray for you this week. The couple was accused of faking miracles by Naijas Craziest IG account. In the first clip, Natasha is prophesying to a man and releasing his blessings. The same man is then seen at the altar with Prophet Carmel and is said to have been healed from an eye problem as Carmel was praying. "A church is like a hospital so you pray for different people over different issues. The same person can be needing healing or marriage, so these are false allegations." Prophet Carmel said they have no intention of faking anything and Jesus is the healer.
