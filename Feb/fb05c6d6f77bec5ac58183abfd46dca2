Chelsea head off to the Fifa Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates this week with a chance to be named world champions — but fans may wonder if it will hinder their chances closer to home. The European champions have had two Premier League games postponed because of their trip to Abu Dhabi, which could add to their fixture congestion when they get back. Chelsea face Al Hilal in the semi-final on Wednesday, only four days after their extra-time win over Plymouth in the FA Cup. But data shows the four previous English teams to play at the Club World Cup in its current format (since 2005) have not suffered on their return. They have all won at least one trophy — and their final league position has never been worse then the position they were in on leaving. Manchester United in 2008-09 and Liverpool in 2019-20 both won the Premier League titles (with United also winning the League Cup) after winning the Club World Cup. Liverpool won the 2005-06 FA Cup and Chelsea lifted the Europa League in 2012-13 — with both sides having lost the final. To add to that, all four won their first Premier League game on returning to England.
