US-based Kenyan rapper and afrobeat artiste Wakobi is riding with his new song 'Forgiven' inspired by real life. Wokabi, was born in America and raised between America, Nigeria and Kenya, which ultimately helped him to connect to his African roots and cultural heritage. Speaking to Word Is, he said music has been a part of his life since he was eight years old. "In 'Forgiven', I speak about God, asking Him to make the things that try to keep us from achieving our dreams to stay away," he said. "The song came from my mind naturally by the Holy Ghost. It was the state of mind I was in at that time. It took me an hour to work on it." His message to fans is to not give up if whatever they are working for is not yet there.
