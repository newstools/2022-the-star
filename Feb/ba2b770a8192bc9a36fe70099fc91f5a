Cartoon Comedian alleges that an artiste sent goons to beat her up. In a video that went viral, Cartoon said it happened after she took a jab at an artiste whom she termed as untalented. "Just because I said someone is not talented, I was sent goons to beat me up. Is that really right? Just because I said they don't have talent. I said it the other day and today, they sent people to destroy my looks." She pointed at the scars on her face. She said three people came at her and assaulted her with a torch. Using her Instagram page a few days ago, the comic threw shade, "Real bosses don’t force talent... Na msiseme nimetaja 'mapenzi tight'." Fans speculated that she was taking a jab at Diana Marua.
