One of West Ham United's sponsors is considering its position with the club after defender Kurt Zouma was selected for Tuesday's win over Watford hours after a video emerged of him abusing his cat. Florida-based tourist organisation Experience Kissimmee said it was "disheartened" that Zouma played in the Premier League match despite widespread condemnation of his actions. West Ham manager David Moyes, though disappointed in his player and describing himself as an animal lover, justified the decision to include Zouma. "My job was to try and win for West Ham, and put out the best team to do that," Moyes said. In a Twitter message Experience, Kissimmee said: "It was disheartening to learn that the player Kurt Zouma was part of the starting line in West Ham United's game. "As we wait for further information from WHU, we will be evaluating our relationship and sponsorship with the club." The video, filmed by Zouma's brother Yoan and posted on social media, showed the Frenchman dropping the tabby cat and kicking it across the floor. He is also seen slapping the animal and hurling a shoe at it, before chasing it around his property. West Ham issued a statement condemning Zouma and said they would take action internally. The 27-year-old Zouma, and his brother, both issued apologies. "There are no excuses for my behaviour, which I sincerely regret. I also want to say how deeply sorry I am to anyone who was upset by the video," he said. Essex Police and Zouma's sponsor Adidas said they were investigating the incident which caused widespread outrage. "No animal should be subject to cruel and unwarranted abuse, and we are investigating the incident internally," sportswear giant Adidas said in a statement. Animal charity the RSPCA also said it would investigate the matter while an online petition to prosecute Zouma and have his animal re-homed has been signed by 123,000 people.
