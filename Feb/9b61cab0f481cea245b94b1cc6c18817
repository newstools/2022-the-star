Leaders allied to ODM have warned Deputy President William Ruto against disrespecting their leader Raila Odinga and his handshake partner President Uhuru Kenyatta. Led by Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho, the leaders demanded respect from Ruto if he is to hold rallies in Azimio and ODM strongholds. Joho said every Kenya has a right to hold rallies in any part of the country, but not to disrespect other leaders. “Ruto should sell his agenda without talking ill of Raila and Uhuru,” the Mombasa governor said. Speaking while drumming up support for Azimio la Umoja in Siaya, Joho said he has found Raila to be the best bet for the presidency. Joho was accompanied by Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga, Siaya Senator James Orengo, Senator Ledama Olekina (Narok) and Kieni MP Kanini Kega. Others were Muranga Woman Representative Sabina Chege and Siaya MPs led by Bondo's Gideon Ochanda. Senator Orengo said, “Ruto is fighting for the presidency to use it as cash box and it’s through the ballot box that we shall lock him out and save public taxes.” Olekina said Ruto’s bitterness has ruined his bid for the presidency. Suna East MP Junet Mohamed said had it not been for Uhuru, Ruto would be selling chicken in Sugoi and hence should apologise and give the President the respect he deserves. “Without President Kenyatta who made you DP, you would be nobody but a seller of chicken in Eldoret,” he added. Chege told Nyanza residents to turn up in large numbers on August 9 and vote for Raila as the fifth president. “It's Raila who can put a level playing field for all of us. That’s why we have abandoned our duties and pitched tent in Siaya and Nyanza at large to support initiatives that would increase votes that will be cast in favour of Raila,” she added. Edited by A.N
