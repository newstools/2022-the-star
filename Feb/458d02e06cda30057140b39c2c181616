Kisumu county government has dismissed claims that they have concentrated development projects within the city and ignored rural areas. Governor Anyang Nyong'o said they have a robust development plan for all subcounties. "We are doing roads, ECDEs, hospitals and water projects," he said. Nyong'o was speaking during the launch of the second phase of Kibuye market. "We want to use this occasion to debunk claims by some of our critics that we are ignoring the rural areas," he said. In the past one week, Nyong'o said they have been ensuring the county 's roads are passable for  both motorised and non-motorised traffic throughout the year. He said the programme is ambitious as it seeks to maintain 210km of roads across the county. Specifically, it will maintain 3km of roads per village. "To make this programme a success, the county has recruited on a casual basis, five technical supervisors, 35 supervisors, and 280 road maintenance labourers," he said. This translates to one supervisor and eight workers per ward. A total of Sh14 million has been set aside to cater for wages for the team during the first phase. On Education, the governor said last week they launched the 2022 first tranche of scholarships and bursaries amounting to Sh102 million which will support 1,330 scholarship and 33,000 bursary beneficiaries. In the last financial year, he said they gave bursaries totalling Sh205 million. "I  wish to assure the people of  Kisumu, that we are determined to deliver all the promises I made in 2017.  More than 90 percent of the pledges I made in my manifesto have been implemented," he added. Nyong'o said they will not be distracted from work by critics.
