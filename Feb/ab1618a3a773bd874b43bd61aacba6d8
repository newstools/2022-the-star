Legendary Tanzanian rapper-turned-politician Prof Jay is fighting for his life in ICU at the Muhimbili National Hospital. Jay has been unwell for close to a month. According to Tanzanian blogger Mange Kimambi, Jay is undergoing dialysis and has high blood pressure. It is alleged his condition became worse after he got Covid-19. His family has not confirmed or denied the allegations. Jay was first admitted to Lugano Hospital but was transferred to a different hospital due to the severity of his condition. According to Mange, his condition has greatly improved but he still needs a lot of prayers from his fans. His wife told Wasafi media he is improving. Zuchu said she was working on a project with Prof Jay before he fell ill.
