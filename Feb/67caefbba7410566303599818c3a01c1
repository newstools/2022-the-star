Two Canadian nationals are among at least four people who lost their lives in an accident in Dagoretti along Ngong Road, Nairobi. The four died after the four-wheel-drive car they were travelling in hit a roadside wall before it plunged into a railway track. Two others were injured in the accident that occurred on Sunday. Police and witnesses said the car was moving from the Karen direction to the city centre when the driver lost control and plunged into a railway track. The two others who were injured were admitted to a hospital in Nairobi, deputy police boss James Mugera said. The incident caused a huge traffic jam on the busy road as officials tried to rescue those trapped in the car for almost three hours. Mugera said officials are investigating the incident and that the scene was cleared later in the afternoon. Locals asked authorities to rectify boulders at the scene, which they claimed are a death trap for motorists using the road.
