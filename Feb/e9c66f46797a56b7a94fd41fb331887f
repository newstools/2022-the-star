Oats are among the most nutrient-dense foods available. They are a whole-grain food, known scientifically as Avena sativa. Oat groats, the most whole form of oats, take a long time to cook. For this reason, the most commonly used is rolled, crushed or steel-cut oats. Instant (quick) oats are the most highly processed variety. Oatmeal is also included in muffins, granola bars, cookies and other baking recipes. The nutrient composition of oats is well-balanced. They are rich in carbohydrates and fibre, including the powerful fibre beta-glucan, but are also higher in protein and fat than most other grains. They are very high in vitamins, minerals and antioxidant plant compounds. One unique group of antioxidants almost solely found in oats may help lower blood pressure levels.
