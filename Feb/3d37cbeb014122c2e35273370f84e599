Kenyans are the top consumers of YouTube content in Africa, statistics have shown. However, only 45 per cent of Kenyan content is consumed by the global audience. The statistics were released this week during this year’s YouTube Annual Roundtable virtual meeting. YouTube Africa managing director Alex Okosi said Kenya’s content creation growth also rose at the highest pace year over year at 70 per cent. He unveiled a new team to drive the YouTube content creation campaign. Okosi said a number of initiatives have been launched to help creators in Kenya to improve the quality of content uploaded on YouTube, thereby enhancing their reach and earning potential. Nigeria, which has 300 channels with more than 100,000 subscribers, has up to 75 per cent of its content consumed by a global audience while South Africa’s content attracts 65 per cent of viewers. "Africa has an amazing culture and good storytellers who use YouTube to showcase Africa’s diversity. We are committed to enabling these Creators to voice their stories and provide access to the rest of the world using YouTube which, in the long run, leads us too to success," Okosi said. Otile Brown is among those who have more than one million subscribers each, with one channel boasting of having achieved more than a billion views. The number of creators earning more than Sh1 million monthly from content creation on YouTube is up 60 per cent year over year with 400 Kenyan channels having 100,000 subscribers each, the highest in Africa. More than 70 per cent of watch time happens on mobile devices while YouTube watch time on mobile app devices averages more than 60 minutes per day. Watch time on YouTube on television screens alone now tops more than 250 million hours per day.
