East Africa Classic Safari chair Joey Ghose expects this year's edition of the nine-day tournament to be the most memorable in its 18-year history. The 10th edition of the event has thus far attracted 90 participants, including international drivers from 15 countries, and will cover over 5,000km across the country. Ghose is optimistic the February 10-18 event will be one of a kind by virtue of this record attendance. "The tenth edition is one of its kind as we will have a record number of participants from across the globe, which is a sharp increase in number from the past editions,” Ghose said. He was speaking on Tuesday after telco giant Safaricom announced a Sh 6 million sponsorship, through its Mpesa platform, towards the rally. Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said they identify with the ideals of the rally and are hopeful local drivers will shine. “Safaricom has been a key supporter of the East African Classic Safari Rally for the last two editions. Our involvement in this event underlines our commitment to nurture talent in sports. By featuring local and international drivers, the rally provides an opportunity to empower and inspire more local drivers,” he said. The rally, which is renowned for its toughness,  will commence with a shakedown at Kedong ranch, Naivasha, before proceeding to Sarova Woodlands, Nakuru, Aberdare Prestige, Nanyuki (two days), Kilima Camp, Amboseli (three days) as well as Salt Lick Lodge at Taita Hills. It will then conclude at Ocean Sports in Watamu, where the winners will be awarded. Only two-wheel drive, naturally aspirated rally cars built before 1985, are allowed to compete in this event, which aims to showcase the beauty of the East African landscape. The previous winners of the Classic include legends of motorsport including Björn Waldegård, Ian Duncan, Stig Blomqvist, and local driver Carl “Flash” Tundo.
