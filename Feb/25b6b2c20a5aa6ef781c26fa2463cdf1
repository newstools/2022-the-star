VDJ Jones has thrown shade at comedian Jalang'o, saying he refused to play Gengetone music. In an interview with Plug TV, VDJ Jones said the comedian pulled the Gengetone music down many times yet he wants the youth to support him. "Jalang'o kept saying Gengetone itaisha, he even denied us airplay," he said. "The same guys he refused to support are the ones who will support him. "If he had supported the young guys, they would have easily supported him now. The world is a circle, he shouldn't forget that, but namuombea apite." Jones denied claims he has been paid to vie for the Nairobi governor seat. "I am doing so because I want to change people's lives. I am not a star, so what should make me change once I become a politician? The politicians keep promising the youth jobs but you have to be a youth to understand the struggles they are going through." Jalang'o is vying for the Lang'ata parliamentary seat using the ODM party.
