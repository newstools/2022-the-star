A family from South Mugirango in Kisii county has urged government to intervene and help them bury their mother. The body has been lying in the morgue since August last year following a land dispute. The family says they are unable to inter the remains of Alice Kerubo, 70, at their land in Transmara West subcounty after a Kilgoris court directed that they vacate because they don't have title deed of the 10-acre land. The ruling delivered by Kilgoris Senior Principal Magistrate R. M. Oanda in November last year directed that the family voluntarily vacates the land within six months or they would be evicted. The magistrate directed the OCS’s of Nyamaiya, Enosean Police Stations or subcounty police commander Transamara West to enforce the same. Family spokesperson Gideon Abuya, has since been allowed by the court to appeal against the decision through Advocate Samson Sagwe.
