Former Nzoia Sugar Company chairman Lawrence Sifuna has declared he will vie for Bungoma senator on the ODM ticket. He said he reached the decision after consulting widely with his supporters in the county. Speaking in Bungoma town, Sifuna said on Thursday that he is the only one who has what it takes to dislodge Senator Moses Wetang'ula. "I'm the only person with political experience who can send the Ford Kenya party leader home early in the morning," he said. He said he is sure of winning the seat on August 9 and urged residents to rally behind him. Sifuna contested the seat in 2013 but lost to Wetang'ula. He said he could have won the seat in 2017 but was prevailed upon by ODM party leader Raila Odinga to step down for Wetang'ula who was a NASA principal. Sifuna said, however, if Azimio La Umoja asks him to step down for the DAP-Kenya candidate, he will vie as an independent. "I will run as an independent candidate if they bring the issue of zoning again," he said. Edited by A.N
