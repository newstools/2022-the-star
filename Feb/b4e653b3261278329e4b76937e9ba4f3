Blazers' all-time top scorer Jacquiline Mwangi has hinted at quitting club hockey to focus on coaching. Mwangi is the national women's team coach and recently guided the Kenya Queens to bronze in the recently concluded African Cup of Nations—her first major assignment since being appointed in March 2020 to revive Kenya's dwindling fortunes. "I want to take a break but I have not retired.  At the moment, I haven't thought about returning to the turf anytime soon in as much as I enjoy playing," said Mwangi, who has enjoyed a 13-year (2002-2015) stint with the national team. Mwangi joined Telkom in 2007 before it was re-branded to Blazers in 2019 after the telecommunication company halted their sponsorship deal. She is currently a member of the International Hockey  Federation (IHF) athletes' committee and development committee. She works with Hillcrest International School, Nairobi as a sports teacher. "I am currently serving as player-cum-coach but leaning towards coaching. I retired from national team duties in 2015 to concentrate on club career but one can't play forever but I am not ruling out a return." Her passion for the game made her one of the most prolific strikers for club and country in the last decade. Mwangi also boasts of five African Cup for Club Championship titles with Blazers. Her decorated career also includes winning more than 15 national league titles. Mwangi is keen to stamp her authority and philosophy in the national team to avoid hitches in the rebuilding process. The team is in transition with the majority of the under 21 players graduating to the senior team and impressing at ACN. The players are back with their respective clubs in preparation for the resumption of the Kenya Hockey Union League later this month but they will be closely monitored. "We are assessing our achievements in order to improve on our weaknesses.  We would like to expose the players to high-performance training in order to Improve on setpieces," he said.
