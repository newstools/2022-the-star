A robbery with violence suspect was on Saturday night killed in a police crackdown on criminal gangs in Kawangware, Nairobi. In a statement, Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said the suspect was part of a gang that has been stealing from area residents. "The suspect, who was part of a miscreant gang that was robbing pedestrians of their valuables, had just accosted a man who was headed home at around 9 pm," he said on Sunday. "It is the man’s screams of despair that attracted the cops who were on patrol along Kabiru road." Kinoti said the suspects opened fire at officers on patrol who had heard the victim's scream and rushed to the scene. "What followed was a deafening hail of fire as the officers gave the thugs a taste of their own medicine, fatally wounding one of them as his accomplices scampered for dear life with gunshot injuries." A firearm loaded with three rounds of 9mm calibre was recovered from the suspect who was killed. Cops have launched a manhunt for the two suspects who escaped. Police have intensified crackdowns on criminals and criminal gangs that have been terrorising city residents.
