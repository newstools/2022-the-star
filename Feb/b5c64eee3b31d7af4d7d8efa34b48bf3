International Chess Federation (FIDE) Arkady Dvorkovich is due in Kenya tonight to monitor the progress of the sport in the slums and refugee camps. Chess Kenya (CK) president Bernard Wanjala says the supremo will visit Kakuma Refugee Camp and Mukuru Kwa Njenga slums to assess the various projects initiated by FIDE a year ago. FIDE started the sport in refugee camps and the project has been supervised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and FIDE Social Commission. "As a federation, we have been monitoring this sport in such places and his visit to the refugee camps will motivate many young people and the refugees to enjoy life in the game,” Wanjala said. Dvorkovich, who will be accompanied by FIDE managing director, Dana Reizniece-Ozola, will also meet Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed as well as the Commissioner of Prisons John Kibasio Warioba on Thursday. Wanjala is optimistic the visit will unlock more opportunities for chess to grow in Kenya and build more confidence in the many stakeholders we are pursuing. “The reason why we are meeting the Director-General is that we have introduced chess in prisons. The calendar will be busy starting with a meeting with the Director-General of Prisons and later on with the  Sports CS. The visit by the president will give Kenyan players an opportunity to shine at the international level," he said Wanjala added: "We will end the day by visiting Mukuru Kwa Njenga to see the impact of chess on children living in harsh conditions in slums."
