President Uhuru Kenyatta has fired back at Deputy President William Ruto saying his unbridled ambitions are to blame for his downfall. He said the Azimio-One Kenya coalition will build a mega-machine that will crash the crooks. "Do you support me to work with these elders to fight those wakora'?" Uhuru said at KICC. The president told Ruto that he will write history as the first country where a government united with the opposition. "I heard one person saying that there is nowhere in the world where a government unites with and supports the opposition," Uhuru said. He went on: "Kenya will be the example, we are mature enough to distinguish between politics and the needs of the people,.' The president said ODM boss Raila Odinga and other opposition leaders had helped him to extinguish the fire in Jubilee. "If they helped me extinguish the fire when my house caught fire. I say thank you for helping me put out the fire," Uhuru said. He went on: "When you have someone whom you shared responsibly almost down the middle but he absconds, and you have someone who comes and helps you when your house is on fire, who is a better neighbor?' Uhuru posed.
