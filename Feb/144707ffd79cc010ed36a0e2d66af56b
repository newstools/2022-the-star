The Teso community is in mourning. This follows the death of Papa Emorimor Augustine Lemukol Osuban who was the cultural leader and paramount chief of the Iteso community from Kenya and Uganda. The 88-year-old Emorimor passed on at Mulago referral hospital on Friday evening. He had been hospitalized since January 27, after he was first diagnosed with Covid-19 in Soroti Regional Referral hospital in Uganda on January 18. Emorimor was the cultural leader uniting Iteso from Kenya and Uganda. His death comes just weeks after the leaders of Iteso Cultural Union(ICU) had announced that elections to choose a new leader would be conducted in March this year. Uganda President Yoweri Museveni described him as a great advocate for peace and unity and declared a state burial for the Iteso king. "I join the people of Teso and the entire country to mourn the death of the Teso Cultural Leader, His Highness Emorimor Papa Osuban Augustine Lemukol. He was a great advocate of peace and unity, his devotion to preaching about moral and cultural values was paramount," Museveni said. President Museveni among other leaders will attend Emorimor's burial on February 14. Busia governor Sospeter Ojamong mourned the leader as a great man. The Teso community will remember Emorimor Papa for the good work he did on raising up inter-clan connections
