The proposed changes on the election law to anchor a complementary system of managing the general election is scheduled for first reading in the National Assembly on Tuesday afternoon. The first attempt to take the bill through the formal introduction was met with resistance after UDA-allied MPs voted to defeat a motion to reduce its publication period from 14 days to five. The reading of the Elections (Amendment) Bill, 2022 - as has been lined up in the Order Paper for plenary sittings, on Tuesday, would pave way for public participation. After the first reading, the bill would be subject to the consideration of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) after which they would be expected to issue a report for a vote in the plenary. The law has sparked mixed reactions following some of its proposals seeking to allow manual transmission of results. Earlier, IEBC and various stakeholders have defended the bill sponsored by Majority leader Amos Kimunya as one that stands to correct wrongs in the existing law. “The Bill proposes a complementary mechanism for result transmission to address instances where transmission of results is not possible owing to lack of 3G network which is the minimum standard required for transmission of results Form,” IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said in a statement. The proposed law is set to delete the provisions of the Elections Act which were declared unconstitutional by the High Court in the Katiba Institute case.
