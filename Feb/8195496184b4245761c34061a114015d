Two more aspirants have joined the race to unseat Taita Taveta Woman Representative Lydia Haika. This brings the number of aspirants to seven. The latest entrants are outgoing Water and Environment executive Esther Mwanyumba and former Trade executive Gertrude Shuwe. The others are youth leader Cate Mashame, Linah Chao, Fridah Mwadime and Priscilla Mwangeka, former Governor Granton Samboja’s adviser on gender. In a statement on Wednesday, Mwanyuma said she will seek the Wiper party ticket. “If elected, I will prioritise legislating issues affecting the vulnerable and marginalised groups like women, girls, PWDs, youth and the elderly,” the former teacher said. Mwanyuma promised to promote development through the Social Development Fund, donors and other development partners. She served as Wusi-Kishamba ward administrator before rising to the position of county executive. Mwangeka, who has twice failed to capture the seat— in 2013 and 2017— is yet to reveal her party of choice. Initially it had been though Mwangeka would deputise Governor Samboja in the August 9 election. This followed a falling out between Samboja and Deputy Governor Majala Mlagui. Mlagui has already declared her interest in the Mwatate parliamentary seat. She will be seeking the Wiper ticket. Shuwe's entrance is likely to send incumbent Haika back to the drawing board as both are from Taveta constituency. Haika is banking on women and youth groups, who have benefited from her empowerment programmes to recapture the seat. “In my quest to ensure prosperity for all, I have been supporting groups that have sought funds in my office. I intend to support groups in our county for prosperity,” Haika said during a meeting in Wundanyi. Haika, a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto, has been the United Democratic Alliance’s point person in the county. She is considered a front runner in the race. Edited by Josephine M. Mayuya
