Homa Bay Woman rep Gladys Wanga on Sunday launched her bid for the county's gubernatorial seat in the August 9 elections. The event was attended by several sitting and aspiring MPs allied to ODM leader Raila Odinga. As part of her plan for the people of Homa Bay if elected governor, Wanga promised jobs, better education opportunities, improved healthcare and end of corruption. "My goal is to renovate and expand the Homa Bay teaching and Referral Hospital to meet the level five requirements. I will create an efficient healthcare infrastructure build on Universal Healthcare Coverage that will make the residents of this county enjoy the benefits of Baba Care which is Raila Odnga's pillar on health," she said. "I want to make Homa Bay part of the National grand coalition against corruption. My government will not tolerate corruption because it rips our people of the development that they should get." Wanga said she will expand the agriculture sector in the county to ensure enough food for the people and more for export. She pledged to continue with the infrastructure projects President Uhuru Kenyatta started in the region including roads, highways and the boating industry. Wanga was accompanied by a group of Azimio women group led by Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu. Ngilu while lobbying for Raila Odinga’s presidential bid, took a swipe at DP William Ruto labelling him as a 'conman' over his botton-up economic model. "Bottom-up? I've never heard of that language myself. It is a language of conmen," Ngilu said. Other leaders who spoke in the event include Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu, Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi and Samburu MP Naisula Lesuda among others.
