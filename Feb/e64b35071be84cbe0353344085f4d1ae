Dalgona coffee came to Tiktok about 2 years ago, inspired by a Korean Tiktoker. Dalgona Coffee is a frothy coffee drink that is usually best enjoyed chilled. Instant coffee powder is beaten along with sugar and water until it is creamy, light, and fluffy. Then the layer is placed on top of iced milk. Because the density of this “whipped coffee layer” is so much lighter than the milk, it floats on top. It tastes heavenly, and you should actually try it at home. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a bowl, combine the coffee and sugar and some hot water. Whisk vigorously for 4 minutes or until the mixture is light brown and fluffy. Step 2 Add a generous amount of ice cubes in a glass then top off with milk. Step 3 Scoop the whipped coffee and layer on top of the iced milk and enjoy!
