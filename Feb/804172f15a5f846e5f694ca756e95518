Nzoia Water has lost over Sh28 million in Bungoma county due to water diversion and disconnection of pumps since April last year. Tom Musungu of Nzoia Water and Sewerage Company said a huge amount of water is lost due to diversion by farmers in the upper part of Cheptais. The official, who spoke on Wednesday in Cheptais market, said irrigation has dealt the company a major blow. He said some people were also stealing and disconnecting water pumps for sale. Mt Elgon region is the agricultural basket for Western Kenya. The region produces maize, beans, onions, potatoes and other perishable farm produce. “We will be visiting the areas where irrigation is done in large scale, to asses the diversions,” Musungu said. He said the company will undertake serious measures to bring to book those culprits denying the company revenue and clients access. “Sh28 million is not pocket change, this money can help us improve on our services so that the essential commodity reaches every household in the county," Musungu said. The official said it is the company's mandate to provide clean water for use and nobody should interfere with it. Nzowasco provides water for residents of Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties. In the recent past, the firm has faced harsh criticism from residents in major towns of Webuye, Bungoma Kimilili and Chwele over frequent water shortages. Nzowasco management however said the water crisis is as a  result of a Chinese contractor working on the dualling of the highway from Musikoma to Kanduyi. “The contractor vandalised our main pipes and has not replaced them,”  the chairperson Rabbeca masibayi said. She said they were still in talks with the county government and the contractor to ensure that the pipes are reconnected. Masibayi said another main line that served the town from Sikata though Lusaka road is not functioning and its repair requires almost Sh11 million. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
