The National Oil Corporation of Kenya is in a financial squeeze. It needs Sh13.5 billion to stay afloat (see P12). Nock is not a strategic national company like Kenya Airways which has to be protected at all costs. Most of Nock's activities are effectively duplicated by the private sector. Its petrol stations across the country are no cheaper or better than private petrol stations. Nock owes Sh6.6 billion to Stanbic and KCB who last year wanted to take control of the oil company. It is losing Sh1.5 billion annually and needs Sh3.6 billion for operational costs. And it needs another Sh1.8 billion t run its day-to-day activities and a further Sh1.2 billion in capital expenditure. Most of which is to fund oil exploration in its block in the Rift Valley. There is no strategic benefit from Nock competing with private petrol stations but, arguably, there is a strategic interest for a state company to have a stake in oil exploration. So let KCB and Stanbic take over Nock to recover their loans and let them sell its infrastructure to its private-sector rivals. But let government set up a new Special Purpose Vehicle to keep Nock's exploration rights in national ownership. Let Nock evolve into being an oil developer rather than an oil marketer.
