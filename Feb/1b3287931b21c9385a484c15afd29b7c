Tottenham Hotspur have an obligation to buy defender Cristian Romero at the end of the season after an initial loan deal, manager Antonio Conte said, as he heaped praise on the Argentina international. Romero joined Tottenham from Atalanta in August, with the Italian club announcing the deal would be a loan until the end of the season. British media reported the purchase price to be an initial 50 million euros ($57.12 million) plus a further 5 million euros in add-ons. "He's on loan but we have an obligation to buy. We bought him," Conte told British media before Wednesday's Premier League game at home to Southampton. "Romero is perfect for the Premier League. He's strong physically, he has the timing to anticipate, and good personality to play with the ball. "Despite being a young player, he has good experience, he's strong. I like him. For sure, he has a lot of space for improvement." The 23-year-old center-back has not played in the Premier League since November after picking up a hamstring injury while on international duty that month. He returned for Tottenham's 3-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion last weekend in the FA Cup fourth round. Tottenham are seventh in the Premier League on 36 points after 20 matches.
