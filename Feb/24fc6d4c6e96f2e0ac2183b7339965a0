Former long-serving Kenya Seed Managing director Nathaniel Kipkorir arap Tum is dead. The 73-year-old former MD died on Tuesday, February 22 at Nairobi hospital. He succumbed to cardiac arrest. His son Jacob Tum confirmed the tragic news saying he died of cardiac arrest and miloma. "It is indeed true that we lost Mzee at 7:28 am today (Tuesday) after battling miloma and cardiac arrest for a long time. The body is still lying at the hospital as the family deliberates on the next move," he told the star in a telephone interview. Jacob described the death as a blow to the family saying they had lost an important pillar in their life. His death comes barely a year after his wife passed on. Speaking on behalf of the Board, management and staff of Kenya Seed, Fred Oloibe pledged support to the family and friends of the late Tum. "We have learnt of the demise of Dr Nathaniel Tum with shock and disbelief. We join his family friends and relatives in expressing our heartfelt condolences," Mr Oloibe said. Tum served as the Managing Director of the giant seed company between 1980 and 20O3 when he was sacked by the then Agriculture Minister Kipruto Arap Kirwa. Maize seed farmers led by John Kituyi expressed shock at the passing of Tum describing him as a champion of the seed industry who assisted farmers to realize their potential. "Tum was instrumental in helping and encouraging many farmers to venture into what today has transformed the giant company into a powerhouse," he said.
