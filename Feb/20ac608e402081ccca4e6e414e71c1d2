Sweden's Linnea Strom fired a decent round of 5 under par 67 to take the lead on the opening day of the Magical Kenya Ladies Open at the par 72 PGA Vipingo Ridge course. The Swede was 5 under going into the last hole (18), where she dropped a shot to close the day with a two-stroke lead from Emma Grechi of France. Grechi played a round of 2 under and will be hoping to make amends tomorrow. "The opening round was all good. I dropped a shot in the 18th hole but I'm glad I made it through to the top. The essence, for now, is to hit the fairways more and play a good short game. For now, I can say it's still early days," said Strom. Amy Boulden of Wales played 1 under to take third place. It was a bad day in the office for defending Champion Esther Hensleit who fired a disappointing 2 over par 74. Hensleit is hoping to retain the title she won in 2019 at the same venue when the Kenya round served as the season-ender. But her performance on the first day means she has no choice but to shoot a lower score tomorrow, where the cut will be determined. Meanwhile, Kenyan players struggled to keep up with the conditions at Vipingo Ridge which is the only PGA accredited course in the country. Kenya's sole professional Bhavi Shah played a disappointing round of 20 over par 92 while Vet Lab's Mercy Nyanchama played a +7. Nandi Bears' Faith Chemutai closed the day with a +17. Despite a very tough round for Bhavi, the sole Kenyan professional promised to leave behind her Day One woes and focus on the second round. "We had a very nice day and cloudy weather in the morning. I started off well but somehow along the way, I fell off the rail and tried to hang in there," Bhavi said. She added: "I definitely have to go easy in round two. I need to leave behind my troubles and play my own game." The Kenya team is without 14-year-old Chanelle Wangari who pulled out due to pressing family commitments. The MKLO is sponsored by Magical Kenya, Johnny Walker, Safaricom, and KCB Bank among others.
