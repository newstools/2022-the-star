Meru women have been urged to go for regular screening to help curb surging cases of cervical cancer in the county. Health chief John Inanga said Meru is one of the three leading counties in cancer cases. He spoke on Monday during a screening at Meru town. Inanga said they are trying to battle the disease and have established a cancer center in Meru. He said they are now creating awareness on cervical cancer and vaccination of girls aged 10-14, who are yet to engage in sex. “If cervical cancer is diagnosed early it can be treated. We are urging girls between 10- 14 years, who have not had sexual intercourse to take HPV vaccine,” Inanga said. The health chief said family planning will also help in the fight against cervical cancer. He says research has shown that those who give birth to less children have low risk of the disease. He said they have conducted screening in Kangeta, Kanyakine and Meru town. Inanga said those who are diagnosed will be treated in Meru. He said cervical cancer can be prevented by having one sexual partner. Having multiple sex partners puts one at risk as men are spreaders yet they do not contract the disease. “We have lost many people to the disease and during our screening today we found seven people who have it, despite low turnout,” Inanga said. Health data for cervical cancer from 2017-2021 shows North Imenti leading with 74 cases, South Imenti 66, Central Imenti 46, Buuri 38, Igembe South 32, Tigania East 25, Tigania West 22, Igembe North 20 and Igembe Central 16 cases. Meru's head of non communicable diseases Lillian Karoki said in the oncology registry breast cancer is leading followed by prostate, esophagus, cervical then stomach cancer. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
