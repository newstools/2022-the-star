Malkia Strikers' coach Paul Bitok is keen on venturing into Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) leadership during the June elections. Bitok hinted that the World Championships in August will be his final assignment as a coach as he seeks to focus on the management of the sport. The Kapsabet High School alumnus said he will vie for the vice chairman position during the polls. Bitok is also the current KCB technical director. "I feel I have done enough in as far as coaching is concerned and it's time to try something else. I want to carry the same energy I exhibited in coaching into the national office," he said. Bitok is the first Kenyan to play professional volleyball outside the country following his move to Tunisia in 2003 and later Croatia. "The World Championship to be co-hosted by the Netherlands and Poland in August will be my last assignment," said Bitok, who first played for the Kenya national team at 19. Bitok also guided the team to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for the first time in 16 years. Kenya last qualified for the quadrennial world show in 2004.
