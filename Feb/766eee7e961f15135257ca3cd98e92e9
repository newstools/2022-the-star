DAP-K secretary general Eseli Simiyu has hit back at Deputy President William Ruto over his claims that ODM formed DAP-K and handed it over to its current officials. Yesterday, he dismissed the claims as childish and irrelevant. "DAP-K, which is barely five months in office, is one of the fastest growing parties in the country and East Africa at large. The claims by the DP are in bad faith and malicious and meant to discredit our party," Eseli said. "The DP should not try to discredit DAP-K. This is the newest kid on the block and will produce many elected leaders in the country unlike his UDA party, which has no grassroots support." He said though they back Azimio la Umoja, they have no links with Raila Odinga's ODM. "DAP-K and ODM are all partners in Azimio La Umoja Movement. We are not in any way related at all. We only meet at a place where we agree on ideologies," Eseli said. The Tongaren MP asked Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders to stop panicking and watch as DAP-K harvests the majority of seats in the country. "They are panicking over our popularity, the newest party is causing a lot of jitters for those who don't believe in our ideologies. Let them sit pretty and watch as the majority of leaders decamp to our party. We believe in democracy," Eseli said. On Wednesday, Ruto while on a tour of Tongaren in Bungoma county, castigated DAP-K leaders, accusing them of causing confusion in Western Kenya politics. The DP was in the company of other Kenya Kwanza Alliance members. He said Eseli and Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa have no capacity to form a party but are hiding in DAP-K formed by ODM to create divisions in Western Kenya politics. "There is a party here led by Eseli Simiyu and his friends, it was formed by ODM and handed over to them. They are not independent but rather being held hostage by some ODM bigwigs. If they are men enough, let them fold their party and join ODM so that we face them head on," Ruto said. Edited by A.N
