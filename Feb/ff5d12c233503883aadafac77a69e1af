COTU secretary general Francis Atwoli has yet again reiterated the need to amend the Constitution in order to accommodate President Uhuru Kenyatta once his term comes to an end. Speaking in Mombasa on Monday during the launch of the Universal Health Coverage, Atwoli said that it takes time to have good leaders in the country, hence, the need to keep such people in leadership. Atwoli said that Building Bridges Initiative is a reality that is coming back to Kenyans. “We proposed in May 2017 that it will bring unity in this country. It went on recess but it is coming back soon,” Atwoli said. He added: “We must amend and revisit this Constitution. This president is not retiring like other presidents. He will remain somewhere as Spokesperson Central Kenya”. He dismissed Ruto’s UDA threats asking church leaders to pray for ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi saying that he is losing. “Watu wa kanisa muombee Musalia Mudavadi. Kama si hivyo atapotea (church gores should pray for Mudavadi, if not, he will get lost).” Atwoli said that in 2017, he told Deputy President that he will not be the president of this country and that he can never bow to him. “We are only three in the this Republic of Kenya. Number one is President Uhuru Kenyatta, then Raila Odinga and I am the third, that’s enough.” Cotu's boss said that the dynamics that were used in 2002 to defeat President Moi’s leadership are different from the 2022 dynamics and that no one should blame Uhuru for supporting Raila. “Lead Mt. Kenya as you led them during BBI.”
