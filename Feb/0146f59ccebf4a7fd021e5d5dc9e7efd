Isiolo Woman representative Jaldesa Rehema Dida and her Turkana East counterpart Ali Lokiru have ditched deputy President Willian Ruto's camp. The MPs decamped from Tangatanga and pledged allegiance to the Azimio La Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. Jaldesa left the DP after a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta at State House, Nairobi, on Saturday. She had accompanied Isiolo leaders to State House for deliberations on a myriad of issues that seemingly included the 2022 succession politics. It is while there that he told the Head of State that they will be working together ahead of the August polls saying she had moved to the DP's camp because of anger. "Mweshimiwa Rais nataka nikuhakikishie ya kwamba kuanzia leo tutafanya kazi pamoja. Hiyo maneno ingine ya ile upande ilikua kwa sababu ya hasira," she said. Loosely translates to: "Mr President we will henceforth work together. I was on the other side because of just anger". MP Lokiru on the other hand announced his defection on Friday. He said he had to move to the Azimio camp so that his people and the region at large can reap from development projects being fronted by Raila. "Tunaangalia mahali watu wetu watapata faida. Kwa hivyo mimi niko Azimio. Si kubahatisha, nimeshaenda," he said while addressing a public baraza in his constituency. Loosely translates to: "We are seeking where we can get profit. For that reason I am in Azimio. It is not a gamble, I have already gone to Azimio". The two leaders were supporters of Ruto's first stab at the presidency in the last few months. Their defections serve a blow to the DP considering that the two control massive support and influence in their region. The two will energise the ODM leader's campaign teams in their respective regions as he seeks to put a spirited fight in his fifth bid for the presidency.
