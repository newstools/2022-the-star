Lentils are not only rich in fibre, but folate and potassium as well. They're also a good source of vitamin B1 and iron which helps keep the heart-healthy. This makes them perfect for your body when it comes to managing blood pressure and maintaining cholesterol. Red lentils come in different varieties and usually disintegrate when cooked for a longer period of time as compared to green lentils. They don't need soaking but one can opt to in order to reduce cooking time. They have a sweet taste and are a perfect vegetarian dish. Ingredients Method Note: Before cooking, rinse the lentils in cold water and pick off the broken lentils or debris present then drain the water. In a medium-sized cooking pot add 2 tbsp of virgin olive oil and allow to heat. Add the chopped onions, sprinkle salt stir and let the onions cook till they brown. Add the chopped garlic cloves, and crushed ginger then continue stirring the pot so that they don't stick to the sufuria. Switch to low heat and allow them to simmer till they become aromatic. Still on low heat, drizzle a little bit of water inside the sufuria then add all your spices. Stir gently and cover with a lid to allow the spices to cook for a minute or two. Add the lemon juice and double-concentrated tomato paste and cook, while stirring often, until tomato paste darkens in colour. Add the two cups of lentils and stir until well mixed, allow to simmer while still stirring then add your vegetable broth and bring to a bowl over medium-high heat, skimming foam from surface as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover the sufuria and simmer until lentils are very tender and soup is almost creamy thick. Garnish with chopped coriander or dill and stir gently. Switch off the heat source and set them aside. Serve with the accompaniment of choice (they usually go well with rice or chapatis) and enjoy.
