Afro-pop artiste Ashley Njera has released her new song, Pole Pole, featuring Obidan Dela. Ashley told Word Is her song is inspired by her life experience. "The song is inspired by tunes and social events I have encountered. As a songwriter, I didn’t go to any school. I learn from listening to tunes," she said. The song was produced by Teddy B and the video was directed by Dr Eddie. "I started singing when I was young, especially in the shower," she said. "In class seven, I auditioned for a spot in the school choir and the choirmaster was really impressed. And from there, I knew singing was my passion." Growing up, her mum always listened to Classic 105 FM. "I loved the music, I thought it was the right genre for me."
