Kenya Morans left for Dakar, Senegal yesterday morning for the FIBA Basketball World Cup Qualifiers without a recognized centre. Officials confirmed the lead post players Tom Wamukota and Desmond Owili did not make the team. Wamukota is injured while Owili is unavailable. Assistant coach Sadat Gaya, who jets out today to join the team, said they will use power forwards to fill up the void left by the duo. "We don't have Bush and Owili at the centre position. So we will use our forwards in that position," said Gaya. "To our opponents, the team will look small but when we are wounded and  we will be more dangerous out there." "Everybody in this team can put the ball on the floor. We will be quicker and we will execute a lot better." Kenya will open their campaign at the Dakar Arena tomorrow with a match against DR Congo, a team that beat them in the Afro-Can finals in Mali in 2019. They play Egypt on Saturday before winding up their three-game campaign against hosts Senegal on Sunday. Kenya Basketball Federations (KBF) chairman, Paul Otula thanked the National Olympic Committee of Kenya for facilitating the team's travel. New cap Bron Ayodi will make his first international appearance alongside local-based players led by captain Griffin Ligare, Valentine Nyakinda,  Victor Bosire, Eric Mutoro, Joseph Khaemba, and Victor Ochieng. Diaspora players who will join the rest of the squad in Dakar are Ariel Okal, Albert Odera, Joel Owich, Preston Bungei, and Fidel Okoth. The rest of the team includes manager Mercine Milimu, team doctor Duncan Ndeda and physio Erastus Wainaina.
