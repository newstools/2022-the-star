Bungoma county DAP-K boss Chris Makokha has said that everything is set for tomorrow's Azimio la Umoja rally at Bungoma Posta grounds. Addressing the media at a hotel in Bungoma town when he met DAP-K aspirants from Bungoma county, Makokha revealed that Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati will be officially joining the DAP-K party during the rally. "Friday is the day that Bungoma residents have been waiting for our able governor to give us direction concerning his re-election in the August polls," Makokha said. Makokha noted that DAP-K has so far received defectors from other parties saying the outfit is now strong in the Western region. "DAP- K has now overpowered Ford Kenya and taken shape in Kenyan politics because we have received defectors from other national parties to support Raila's presidential bid," he said. Makokha added that the party has so far over 200 aspirants who will be running from MCA, MP, woman representative, senator and governor seats. "In case there will be more than two aspirants running on DAP-K in the same ward, constituency or county, the party will conduct a fair and free nomination," Makokha said. Makokha assured DAP-K supporters of security during the Friday rally. "We have already set the ground for Friday's rally at Posta grounds, the security is tight, I want to assure our supporters will be experienced at our rally," he said. Makokha rubbished ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula for joining deputy president William Ruto camp. He said it's only Azimio la Umoja that has an agenda to change the economy of the country. The party chairman noted that DAP-K will receive defectors from other parties who will declare their support for Raila Odinga.
