‘Pombe’ hitmaker Iyanii is back with a hilarious Valentine’s Day special, ‘Tukutane kwa bar’, complete with visuals. The jam is about the singles who are set to spend Valentine’s Day alone. Instead of crying themselves to bed, Iyani says they should join him at the bar. He says the short project is dedicated to his fans just to put a smile on their faces as he gears up to unleash more bangers. Iyani is always capitalising on any season with catchy songs that perfectly capture any mood, especially the party mood. In December, Iyanii released a Christmas jam. "This is a song that will help people forget about stress and I’m glad the song has been a success. I wanted to give people a reason to give December more value," he said.
