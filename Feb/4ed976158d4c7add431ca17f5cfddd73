The British High Commissioner Jane Marriott has handed over essential forensic medical equipment worth Sh4.5 m to assist Kenya in the fight against terrorism. In a ceremony at Kenyatta National Hospital with Chief Administration Secretary Rashid Aman on Wednesday, the UK gave out a portable mortuary fridge, mortuary tables, chairs, body bags and evidence bags. They were handed over to the Ministry of Health. Marriott said the equipment is expected to increase the capacity of the Pathology and Forensic Unit while improving disaster response and supporting forensic investigations. "The medical equipment will preserve and analyse crucial evidence needed to identify and convict terrorist offenders, bringing them to justice," she said. "It will also help identify disaster victims and preserve their dignity, to prevent further suffering for grieving families." The UK invests approximately Sh1.1billion a year in Counterterrorism  efforts in Kenya. This ranges from building the capacity of criminal justice institutions through training and mentoring, to reinforcing Kenya’s CT infrastructure such as through security installation investments at the Kahawa Law Court – Kenya’s first court dedicated to addressing terrorism offences. Marriott, said UK is also supporting the construction of the new coastal headquarters for the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit, which will be completed this year. “The scourge of terrorism is a challenge we face in both our countries. We remember the victims of these attack. I am pleased to provide this support to Kenya, to help boost our joint fight against terrorism," she said. Aman said the role played by forensic medical services to the public health and safety of Kenya cannot be underestimated. "We have heard the challenges face by the officers in the Division of Forensic and Pathology Services but I wish to recognize the effortsand successes by this team despite these challenges," he said.
