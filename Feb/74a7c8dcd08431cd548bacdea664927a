A tout who was busted with stolen swimming costumes at Donholm, Nairobi, has been found guilty by a Makadara law court. Senior resident magistrate M Kivuka found Dennis Musyoka guilty but postponed sentencing to allow for production of a probation report. Musyoka, according to court documents, committed the offense together with others not before the court on the night of January 14, 2019. “You entered into a swimwear shop and stole assorted attires worth Sh100,000, the property of Beatrice Onyango, the charge sheet said. He was also charged with the offence of retaining stolen property worth Sh7,000 for his benefit. The court heard that a guard on night shift caught the accused person red-handed at the doorstep of the container shop. The shop had been cut from the back to allow passage. Musyoka was in possession of a sack in which the attires had been stashed inside it. He was restrained and the complainant was called that night. The accused however, lied that he was collecting scrap metals that night. In his defence hearing, he alleged that it was the police officers who placed the swimming costumes inside his sack. Musyoka said at the time of arrest, he only had a few plastics, a sack and a wooden torch. The accused will be held in remand until February 17, when the court will receive a probation report and make a decision on his sentencing. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
