The just-concluded Parklands Open tournament is part of the wider plan by the Kenya Squash Racquets Association to pick the national teams for both Commonwealth and Africa Youth Games Commonwealth Games will be held in July in Birmingham while the Africa Youth Games are scheduled for August in Egypt. The purpose of the event is to help select players for national senior and junior teams with an aim of building a stronger team towards the Commonwealth and Africa Youth Games. According to KSRA, the event, which ended on Tuesday is one of the many competitions they are using to revamp and popularise the sport in the country. The tournament attracted a competitive field of players from as far as  Nigeria and Zambia. “We have been preparing for this tournament for about four months.  Most players came in well-equipped and ready to compete," said coach Prince. He added: "It's been a long time since we organised an event. That is why we made an open call to all players; both experienced as well as beginners or anyone else interested in trying so that no one is locked out.” Arna Maldi, who is currently the top seed in the girls' under-18 junior category reached the quarter-finals of the Parklands Open.  The teen sensation said she is optimistic about making it to the Games later in the year. “I had better preparations for the event and reaching the quarters was no mean feat," Maldi observes. She added: "I am going to give it my all at the national trials. I am well aware that the level of competition there is tougher than it has been here. My priority is to make the Commonwealth team," Maldi said with more sponsors, the sport has the potential to earn recognition in the country. The association is also looking to use such tournaments to expose players and help them gain experience.
