Rapper Nyashinski has encouraged his fans to take risks in anything they want to achieve. Speaking during the Love, Wine and Vibes event at Two Rivers, Nyash took a moment to challenge his fans to never give up in life. "Unaeza take risk unaeza dream, you can be something, you don't have to come from a rich family, you don't have to come from a poor family, you can be something," he said. The 'Hapo tu' hitmaker acknowledged that age is catching up with him and despite his glittering musical legacy, he plans to build a city (Nyashinski City) for his fans. "I am building a city for you guys. This is the first time I am revealing it to you and when it comes to pass, you will remember this moment," he said. He went on to advise all artistes to create content they can live by. "To all artistes, do what you like. My career and life will teach people that they can take risks, they can dream, they can be something. You don't have to come from a rich family, poor family." Nyashinski has sent his fans into a state of confusion after he deleted all his posts on Instagram.
