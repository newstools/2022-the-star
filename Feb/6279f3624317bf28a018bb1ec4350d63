The body of a suspected drug trafficker based in Mombasa who went missing in December last year has been found in a mortuary in Nairobi. Mwinyi Mzungu’s badly mutilated body was found at the City Mortuary Thursday long after he had gone missing since December 20 from his Utange home. Haki Africa said the body was found at City Mortuary and had been identified by the family. “We can confirm that the body of Mwinyi Mzungu is lying at City mortuary in Nairobi. This is after family members positively identified his body,” the agency said Friday. Other officials said the body was recovered from Kinale forest in Kiambu. Mwinyi was a neighbor of Masuo Bakari Tajiri whose badly decomposed body with marks of torture and burns was found in a mortuary in Thika. Mwinyi’s sister said he was abducted on December 20, 2021. “Unknown men came to his house, and enquired about Mwinyi. After confirming it's him, the men claimed to be police officers and stated that he is under arrest. After he enquired about the reason for arrest, the men claimed that he would be told later on," Mwinyi's sister, Sadaka Nyanje said. On December 15, Tajiri was acquitted by a Shanzu court in absentia due to lack of evidence, while his co-accused, Fatuma Sicobo, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Cases of missing persons being found dead have been on the rise in the past months amid protests that most of them are suspects with cases in courts.
