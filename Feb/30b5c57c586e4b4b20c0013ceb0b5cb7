Diamond Platnumz's sister, Esma Khan, has vowed to step aside from involving herself with her brother's relationships as she is tired. Esma admitted that she used to be close to her brother's lovers but not anymore. "Not nowadays. I used to do that but right now, I have a lot to do, I have businesses to run," she told Wasafi TV. "You will not find me again running after my brother's lovers. I do not want to involve myself with his women. "When we see each other, we will greet and go on with our business. It does not involve me. How does his relationship involve me?" Diamond is currently rumoured to be dating his signee Zuchu. Tanzanian media pundits have also accused Diamond of dating his employee and Wasafi presenter Aaliyah, rumours that are yet to be confirmed by either of them. Both Zuchu and Aaliyah were close friends before they split over differences which they've hidden from the public. In a recent interview, Zuchu admitted that she and the presenter are not close. "We are not as close as before but she is one of the people that really helped me coming up in my career." Esma also admitted that she is not close to Zuchu because the singer is not close to Aaliyah. "Zuchu is grown and has her life. They are both my juniors. They should not listen to people's opinions." Asked if she knows of her brother's relationship with the two, she said, "They are both our employees under WCB and they respect me." Zuchu admitted Diamond's step-father, Uncle Shamte, was sent to see her parents. "My parents and his parents speak but I cannot reveal whether or not he went to ask for my hand on behalf of Diamond," she said. "Diamond is a good man, successful." Zuchu also admitted that she was taken to dinner by the singer. Diamond has previously been in a relationship with Wema Sepetu, Zari Hassan, Hamisa Mobetto and Tanasha Donna.
