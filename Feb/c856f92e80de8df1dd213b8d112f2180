ODM chief Raila Odinga is set to formally team up with the One Kenya Alliance in a major political triumph over Deputy President William Ruto. The Star has established that Oka, led by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, will attend a joint ODM and Jubilee National Delegates Convention on Saturday where the deal will be inked. More than 10 political parties supporting Raila's candidature under the Azimio La Umoja Movement will also sign the political pact, reducing the August 9 contest to a two-horse race between the ODM chief and Ruto.
