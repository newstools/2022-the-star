This Peanut butter cocktail is a decadent drink that is certainly not for the faint of heart. It's surprisingly strong however with a smooth and dangerously good sweet flavour. Combining whiskey and peanut butter seems like an off idea but this drink puts that motion to sleep. It’s perfect for people who enjoy creamy cocktails. And totally easy to prepare. The chocolate liqueur and whole milk complement the subtle peanut butter flavour in the whiskey without overwhelming it. The texture and flavour on the rim help to drive home the drink's peanut butter cup theme. Note: Don’t skip the salt as it amplifies flavours, including sweet ones. Ingredients Method Spread peanut butter onto a small plate. Grate the chocolate bar on a grater, and place the shavings on a second plate. Dip and rotate the rims of 2 glasses into the spread peanut butter and then into the chocolate shavings, ensuring they're well coated. Fill each glass with 1/4 cup ice cubes and set them aside. Pour in the whiskey, chocolate liqueur, milk and salt into a cocktail shaker, fill it with ice cubes then shake vigorously for 20 seconds. Note: You can drizzle chocolate syrup at the edge of the inside of the glass if you prefer your drink sweet and want an extra chocolatey taste. As it’ll slowly get absorbed into the drink. However, don’t stir it. Remove the lid, and pour over the ice in the glasses. Serve and enjoy.
