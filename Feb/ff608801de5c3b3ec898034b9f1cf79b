Traffic officers in Bungoma county have launched operations against matatu drivers who break rules on the roads to curb frequent accidents. County commissioner Samuel Kimiti who led traffic officers in launching the 30-day operation revealed that they seeks to arrest all un-roadworthy vehicles to curb accidents. “This exercise is a national task running in the entire country to ensure that road users are safe ,” Kimiti said. He added that they had arrested a good number of drivers along Malaba-Webuye route, saying that stern action will be taken against them. Kimiti noted that Bungoma County Referral Hospital has recorded a high number of accident victims in the past and asked boda boda riders to strictly follow the road rules. “In the past two to three months the country has lost many people to road accidents. According to the NTSA report such a move will ensure that accidents are curbed on our roads,” he said. Kimiti urged NTSA officers on the roads to ensure that boda boda riders follow rules, as the riders are the main cause of accidents. “I want to ask traffic officers on our roads to ensure that boda boda riders are strictly ferrying one passenger, wearing a helmet, a reflector and gloves as a way of protecting themselves from accidents,” he said.
