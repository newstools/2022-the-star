ODM leader Raila Odinga is currently presiding over the party's National Governing Convention(NGC) meeting at Bomas of Kenya. The meeting which brings together all top party officials and elected leaders is expected to ratify the party's nomination rules. The top organ is also expected to stamp NEC's decision to have the election of national officials rescheduled to next year. On Saturday, the Orange Party will hold another political meeting at Kasarani gymnasium where the Azimio la Umoja coalition party - Raila's vehicle in the August polls - will be unveiled. On Thursday, Raila was fronted as the ODM party presidential candidate in the August 9 elections. ODM National Executive Committee made the announcement after a meeting held at Chungwa House, Nairobi. The NEC at the same time approved the party's desire to join the Azimio la Umoja coalition. The move deals a blow to businessman Jimi Wanjigi who has been seeking the ODM ticket for his presidential bid. Wanjigi had moved to court to block the ODM NDC scheduled for Friday and Saturday after the nomination of the presidential candidate failed to appear among the list of the agenda.
