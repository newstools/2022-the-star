Mr Eazi has dropped his latest single, 'I Wanna Run Away'. In it, he joins forces with Dutch-Moroccan DJ and producer R3HAB and alt-pop singer/songwriter Wafia. The song has a reggae-inspired vocal hook and is R3HAB's first collaboration with Mr Eazi. Mr Eazi said he is glad it is finally out. "The song works equally for dancing and has a full range of emotions, and thanks to Wafia for lending your lovely voice. Listeners, this song is yours now." R3HAB said he has been a big fan of Mr Eazi for years, and this record has been a long time coming. "The pure clarity of Wafia’s voice complements Eazi's delivery and brings levels of nuance to the record." Wafia said, "I feel so honoured to be hopping on a track with these two legendary artistes!"
