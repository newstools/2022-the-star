Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria will vie for the Kiambu governor seat in the August polls. The MP made the announcement on Saturday. "The voice of the people is the voice of God. So help me God. Under your wings I feel safe," Kuria said. The MP will vie on his Chama Cha Kazi party ticket. This comes after Kuria released a poll asking Kenyans which seat he should vie for. Kuria had earlier announced that he will not be going for any elective seat in the August polls. The change of mind comes as a surprise to many who thought the MP would go for nothing short of a running mate in the August 9, elections. The second term MP had positioned himself as a potential running mate in the last two years in a move to gain attraction from key presidential candidates. His fall-out with deputy president William Ruto saw him part ways with the UDA  camp that he had supported for a long period. Kuria will now face competition from current governor James Nyoro, former governors William Kabogo and Ferdinand Waititu among other aspirants. Senator Kimani Wamatangi is also said to be eyeing the governor seat.
