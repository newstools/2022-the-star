The absence of the Narc-Kenya leader  Martha Karua at the Jubilee and ODM NDC on Saturday has raised eyebrows on her stand in the recent developments pitting Azimio La Umoja and her One Kenya Alliance. On Friday, when Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka was addressing the press announcing their entry to Azimio, the Narc Kenya leader was conspicuously missing. UDP party leader Cyrus Jirongo and Kanu's Gideon Moi were present during the press conference. During the Narc Kenya NDC that was held on February 18 at Ufungamano House in Nairobi, Karua said that her party was ready to enter into a coalition with like-minded parties ahead of the General Election. She said that the party was to engage other political outfits in a quest to be part of the next government, adding that they are keen to work with parties that are committed to fighting graft, among other vices. But her absence has caused political jitters as it appears tactical depicting a possibility that she is yet to make her stand to fully join the Azimio La Umoja movement. Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka in his address at the Jubilee NDC, however, downplayed her absence saying she was absent to attend to an important matter. “…Our sister Martha Karua of Narc Kenya is here spiritually with us but she had to get over to Kirinyaga and we bring her greetings to you,” Kalonzo said. Since Kalonzo announced OKA's entry to OKA, the iron lady is yet to make a statement approving or denying the motion to join Azimio. Neither has she tweeted or retweeted OKA's statement announcing entry to Azimio, raising eyebrows whether she approved of the development.
