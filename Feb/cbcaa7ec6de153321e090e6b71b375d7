Police are looking for a guard who stabbed a 26-yr-old man to death over a Sh20 parking fee in Kahawa West in Nairobi. DCI director George Kinoti said in the incident reported at 2am on Saturday, the suspect -Saluni - is said to have demanded the fee from the victim, for parking his motorcycle next to a construction site that he watches. "Seeing that the motorcycle owner was adamant and ready to rev up his wheels, Saluni brandished a suspected Somali sword from his Maasai shuka, driving it into the victim's belly before scampering off," Kinoti said. Kinoti said good Samaritans who heard the victim groan in excruciating pain rushed him to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral and Research Hospital, only to be pronounced dead on arrival. His body was taken to the same hospital awaiting autopsy. Investigators drawn from Kasarani have documented the scene, as manhunt for the suspect heightens. "Should you have any information that may assist in the arrest of this suspect, please #FichuakwaDCI by calling 0800 722 203, or report at your nearest police station," Kinoti added.
