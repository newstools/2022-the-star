Deputy President William Ruto remains conspicuously missing from the campaign trail even as his allies continue to hit the ground running. Ruto has been missing from the campaigns which have been spearheaded by Kenya Kwanza coalition partners Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula. The two will on Thursday take their Kenya Kwanza campaigns to Kajiado County. In Kajiado, they will make stopovers in Namanga, Maili Tisa, Ibisil and Ngatataek, where they will address residents. The Kenya Kwanza coalition will be hosted by MPs Katoo Ole Metito and Peris Tobiko. Their visit to Kajiado comes a day after ODM leader Raila Odinga took his Azimio la Umoja gospel to the county. Raila had the chance to engage residents of the county as well as selling them his agenda for the country if elected President on August 9. DP Ruto's whereabouts remain unknown and his aides have remained mum on what the second in command has been up to. He is, however, expected to begin his two-day tour of the coast region on Friday, with scheduled stopovers and events in Taita Taveta and Kilifi counties.
