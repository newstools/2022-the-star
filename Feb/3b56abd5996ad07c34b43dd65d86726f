A rights group has criticised the "slow pace" and other alleged flaws of an ongoing trial into the massacre of 21 civilians killed two years ago in Ngarbuh, Cameroon. An eyewitness who escaped the attack on 14 February 2020 by running into the bush told BBC Newsday that he had returned to find that victims had been shot and their bodies burnt, then dumped in at least three mass graves. He said other survivors saw the attackers, describing them as "wearing military uniforms". The Cameroonian government initially denied allegations that the military was behind the attack, but an inquiry was launched weeks later following international outcry and in a U-turn the government said its forces did bear some responsibility. Those now on trial are two soldiers, a gendarme, a former separatist fighter, and 17 ethnic-Fulani vigilantes, who remain at large, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says. The rights group alleges that during the trial "the only witnesses so far did not see the killings and claimed the victims were separatist fighters". It also argues the court being 450 km (279 miles) from the victims' families homes means they do not have reasonable access, and claims that the presiding judge has a conflict of interests. The Cameroonian government has not responded to the complaints outlined in HRW latest report.
