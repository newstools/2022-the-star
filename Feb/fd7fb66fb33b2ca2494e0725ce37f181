The Democratic Party of Kenya has promised a major political tremor, larger in magnitude than ANC’s earthquake during its delegate’s conference at Bomas of Kenya on Sunday. Party secretary-general Jacob Hajj says there will be a surprise guest during the event, where a major political declaration, which will change Kenya’s political landscape, will be made. The party is expected to endorse Justin Muturi as the party's preferred presidential aspirant. While addressing journalists at the party’s offices, JB Muturi Center, Westlands on Wednesday, officials said all is set for the event. DP head of secretariat Joseph Mathai said they would unveil the realignments within the party. “On that day the mountain snow will literally melt and you should also expect to see a lot of realignments because it's not going to be business as usual when DP finally throws its weight,” he said. He said DP will distance itself from parties associated with bad politics. “W expect a surprise guest on that special day. People have talked on many geographical happenings in their previous NDCs but this one is going to be a major shift,” he said. About 1,200 guests are expected at the event, according to Hajj. "Recently, we were told of an earthquake, but we did not feel it. Even my neighbours asked me if there was really an earthquake,” he said. "We are not going to allow a situation where Kenyans are placed between a rock and a hard place." He said that DP would make history at the NDC.
