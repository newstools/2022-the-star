Lurambi MP Titus Khamala has said he will not disparage his former party leader Musalia Mudavadi even after defecting to Raila Odinga's ODM. Khamala is among five ANC legislators who ditched the outfit in a wave of defections that hit the party in recent weeks. The defections came after Mudavadi decided to work with Deputy President William Ruto. Others are MPs Oku Kaunya (Teso North), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero), Ayub Savula (Lugari) and Tindi Mwale (Butere). “I had my personal reasons why I defected from ANC to ODM. I will not disrespect Mudavadi but look for my votes. I wish him well,” Khamala said. He spoke during the funeral service of George Musungu Tsuma, 94, at Ebukatsi village in Lurambi subcounty on Saturday. Khamala said defections were a normal thing in politics and he should not be judged harshly. “Even Raila and Mudavadi have changed parties several times. It’s nothing new. I am going to look for my votes as Khamala based on what I have done for the people of Lurambi,” he added. Khamala said he did not seek to defect from ANC on his own but was approached by ODM because of his support base. “If you find an avenue to destabilise your opponents, so be it. What matters is to win votes,” he said. The lawmaker said he would invite the DCI to carry out investigations on the use of the NG-CDF kitty, saying cartels were creeping into the management of the fund. There have been complaints by residents about the issuance of bursaries. Khamala said he had taken over the identification and issuance of education bursaries and will issue the cheques himself.
