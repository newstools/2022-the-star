The High Court has declined to lift an order freezing assets and cash in bank accounts totalling to Sh1 billion belonging to a senior official at a public road’s agency. Benson Muteti Musila asked the court to vacate the orders on grounds that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission cannot prove he made the cash illegally by collecting bribes from contractors. Justice Esther Maina in dismissing the application said, “the balance of convenience tilts in preserving the assets.” Musila is accused of amassing Sh1 billion of unexplained wealth. He maintains there is nothing linking the money and his properties to graft. The EACC on July 28 last year instituted a forfeiture suit against Muteti. The accused is the Coast regional manager at Kenya Rural Roads Authority. The commission is seeking to forfeit unexplained assets worth Sh952 million acquired between February 2009 and December 2018 by Muteti, his wife and team. The unexplained wealth comprised bank and M-pesa deposits amounting to Sh567 million, landed properties valued at Sh347 million, motor vehicles valued at Sh5.3 million, listed shares valued at Sh2.2. million and insurance policies with a maturity value of Sh30 million. In the case, EACC claimed it received credible information that Muteti routinely demanded and received bribes and kickbacks from contractors awarded tenders for the supply of public works, goods and services in the Coast region. It subsequently commenced investigations and later established that in the period between February 2009 and December 2018, Muteti exploited his official position at KeRRA by involving himself in transactions that were in conflict with public interest. In particular, Muteti, according to the commission, took undue advantage of his position of trust to confer benefit to himself through awarding several tenders to Skai Kenya limited, a company associated with him through his brother. Justice Maina directed the case be mentioned on March 1.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
