Shrimps are super loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, antioxidants and contain good amounts of zinc and niacin. These tasty sea creatures are low in calories, carbs and fats which make them a suitable meal for someone who is watching their weight. This easy, succulent shrimp recipe is cooked in a garlic and Parmesan cream sauce that is mouth-wateringly delicious. This recipe takes about 20 minutes to prepare, yields about four servings and goes well with a lot of side servings. Ingredients Method: Thoroughly wash your shrimps then peel them. You can choose to either remove the tails or leave them, it doesn't affect the meal. Or preferably you can buy shrimp that has already been peeled to save on time. In a large cooking pot, add oil then allow it to heat over medium-high heat. Add the shrimps season with salt, cumin and white pepper then stir gently. Cover the pot and allow them to cook for about 2 minutes, then change sides and cook for another 2 minutes. This is so as to allow both sides to cook well and absorb the spices. Switch off the heat source, transfer the shrimps to a plate and set them aside. Add butter to the cooking pot and set it over low heat, add the crushed garlic and allow it to cook for about 30 seconds (until fragrant) while gently stirring to avoid it getting burnt. Add the wine and allow it to cook till like half reduces, all the while stirring for about a minute. Note: white wine can be substituted with chicken broth. Pour in the heavy cream, add Parmesan cheese then stir and bring to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low and cook until thickened for about 2 minutes. Note: Be careful not to bring the sauce to a boil as it may curdle. Pour the shrimps into the sauce and gently toss them ensuring they're well enveloped in the sauce. Garnish with parsley then turn off the heat source. Serve with a side dish of choice and enjoy.
