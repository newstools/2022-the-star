ODM leader Raila Odinga has officially welcomed Anthony Kibagendi to his party after quitting the UDA of Deputy President William Ruto. Kibagendi recently resigned from the office of the Deputy President where he served at the Youth Affairs Office. The move comes in the wake of a protracted leadership wrangle facing the UDA party in the Kisii region. Leaders allied to Ruto have been jostling for the control of the party. Kibagendi and South Mugirango MP Sylvanus Osoro differed bitterly over the UDA party leadership resulting in the former leaving the outfit. Kibagendi was welcomed to the ODM party by Raila Odinga and Kisii Governor James Ongwae. His move comes after Ruto’s special secretary for Infrastructure and ICT Maurice Kakai Bissau has ditched the United Democratic Alliance party. Bisau has teamed up with former Rift Valley regional commissioner George Natembeya ahead of the August 9, polls with the former promising to back the latter for the governor seat. On the same day, South Rift top guns backed Raila's bid to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta in the August 9 General Election. The delegation led by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos described the opposition chief as the best bet for the South Rift region. The powerful delegation also had the former head of Public Service Sally Kosgey, ex-MP Paul Sang, CAS Stephen Tarus, and Kipkorir Menjo. The leaders made the declaration during a meeting with the Azimio leader at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Foundation in Upperhill, Nairobi.
