A comment by  deputy president William Ruto during a political rally has sparked online anger in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On Monday, William Ruto told residents of Nyeri, in central Kenya, that there was a big market for their dairy produce in DR Congo - and appeared to suggest that there were no cattle in that country. “We have a market in DR Congo…these people who are singers… These people have a population of about 90 million but they don’t own any cow," he said in Swahili - a clip of which has been widely shared. The remarks have not gone down well in DR Congo, with even some politicians and journalists describing them as disrespectful as he also appears to be disparaging the Congolese as lazy people who only know how to sing. Senator Francine Muyumba took to Twitter and termed the remarks an “insult” and “unacceptable” and asked Mr Ruto to withdraw the statement. “Kenya as a country needs to stand against this statement officially in order to protect the friendship we enjoy between our countries. As we wait for our government to act, we are ready to take parliamentary actions,” she said. The issue has been trending on Twitter in DR Congo for the last two days, with some sharing images of cattle farms in the country: Some Kenyans have defended Ruto, saying he was merely urging dairy farmers to look for opportunities across the region.
