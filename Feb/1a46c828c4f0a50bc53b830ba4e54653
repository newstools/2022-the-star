Kenya Kwanza Alliance on Wednesday gained a boost after Maragua MP Mary Wamaua officially joined them from the ruling Jubilee Party. The MP ditched Jubilee during a rally in Murang’a where deputy president William Ruto had pitched a tent for campaigns. While addressing residents, the MP asked DP William Ruto not to be intimidated by his critics. She affirmed her commitment to the UDA party saying she will defend her seat on the Wheelbarrow party ticket. “Usisikize wale wanasema eti hakuna kazi inafanywa juu ya gari. Nataka nikuambie kwamba wanakupenda juu ulianzia kazi kule kwa ofisi…Wakati kazi ya ofisi ilimalizika ulikuja mashinani ndio uone iyo kazi ambayo mlipanga na rais," she said. Loosely translates to: "Don’t listen to those who are saying that there is no work done from the car top. I want to tell you that these people love you because you started working from the office and when the office work was over, you came to the ground to inspect the progress". The MP lauded the DP for his effort to strengthen women and youth groups in the country, saying that Ruto is a true leader who understands the people. Wamaua has been one of the ardent supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga. She attended Raila's Azimio La Umoja national convention in December last year where the ODM leader announced that he will give a fifth stab at the presidency. The drama unfolded during the rally after Wamaua threatened to leave the function on allegations that she was roughed up by security details. She however stayed through until the end of the function and the ODM party issued an apology over the incident. Her entry will energise the DP's team who is keen on ensuring that he bags the support of the Mt Kenya region. Ruto was accompanied by Kenya Kwanza Alliance principals Musalia Mudavadi of ANC party and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula during his tour of Murang'a.
