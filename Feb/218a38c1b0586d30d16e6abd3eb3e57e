@ppcheti Families who lost their loved ones to the recent terror attacks in Lamu have received Sh100,000 donations from the county government. The cheques were presented to the eleven families from Widho, Juhudi and Hindi villages on Tuesday by Health executive Anne Gathoni. The money is to help the affected families rebuild their lives and be able to set up alternative livelihoods especially for those who lost breadwinners. Gathoni assured the affected residents of continued support to ensure they get their lives back on track. The executive spoke after issuing the cheques at the Juhudi Primary School in Mpeketoni. “This is just a fulfillment of what the governor pledged towards helping those who lost their loved ones during the attacks. This money is to help cushion them from the struggle they have been through since losing their loved ones,” Gathoni said. At least 15 people were killed in separate attacks in Lamu including Widho, Juhudi, Ukumbi, Marafa, Mashogoni, Githurai, Milihoi, Bobo-Sunkia, and Kibokoni villages between January 2 and 10. More than ten houses were torched during the spate of attacks leading to loss of property amounting to millions. Hundreds fled their homes in fear of subsequent attacks while trade, education and general life suffered immensely. The families have been receiving relief food from the county for over a month, in an exercise that began on January 20. The programme is part of the county government’s relief food drive, which began in late 2021 in response to a severe drought. The food drive has so far covered six wards and is being replicated in the remaining wards, with over 32,000 homes being targeted. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
