Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said that the August 9 General Elections will be decisive for the Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Alliance coalition. Speaking at KICC during the second day of the Jubilee Party National Delegates Conference, the One Kenya Alliance principal asked other parties that have signed the deal with the Azimio to be patient. He boldly said the poll is a must-win of the Azimio-OKA alliance adding that they should be united towards achieving that. “I know my friend here governor Amason Kingi had his predisposition before he came, and so as Wamunyinyi. Relax, we are only guided by what is important for this nation. We cannot afford to lose this election. We can’t,” Kalonzo said. Kalonzo also assured the President that they will walk with him as the One Kenya Alliance in fulfilling his dreams of a united country. “We are on this journey as OKA, but we’ll negotiate, dialogue, honest conversation correcting even historical imbalances because building a coalition is not easy.” He asked the president to take the leadership of the Azimio coalition. His remarks come following concerns from Kilifi County Governor Amason Kingi who said that the big guns working on a coalition to fight DP William Ruto will be "slaughtered' if they lose the polls. Kingi, who is the Pan-African Alliance party leader said the Azimio-One Kenya coalition must do whatever it takes to win the August 9 general election. "Kama hili kundi halitakuwa State House jua kwamba tutaisha, tutachinjwa and unajua ni nani na ataanza na wewe, (If this group here will not be at State House, you will be slaughtered and you know who will do that and he will start with you)," Kingi said.
