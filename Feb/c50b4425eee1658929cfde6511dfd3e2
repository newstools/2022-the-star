Top health and tech stakeholders in Africa are set to convene in Nairobi for the Africa Healthcare Supply Chain Dialogue. The forum set for February 22 at the Strathmore Business School seeks to find solutions to supply chain disruptions in case of global uncertainties. The continent's healthcare supply was most hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and last year's Suez canal blockade leading to delays in receipt of Covid-19 vaccines. According to the World Health Organisation, 99 per cent of hospitals and health facilities reported challenges in procurement as at October last year. The summit championed by Pan-African tech firm Xetova, the Health ministry, Corporate Council on Africa, Africa Resource Centre and Safaricom also seeks to bolster the region’s post-pandemic health security by leveraging technology to strengthen supply chains. It will be used to identify opportunities for collaboration between the private sector, public institutions and key stakeholders to redefine access to health care across the continent. “Healthcare is one of the sectors hardest hit by supply chain challenges during the Covid pandemic. We can leverage on technology to mitigate against risk, build efficiencies and resilience moving forward,'' Xetova CEO Bramuel Mwalo said. Safaricom’s chief enterprise business officer Kris Senanu said the firm continues to invest in systems strengthening as part of its contribution towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal of achieving good health and well-being. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi said Kenya is working with partners to support strong, reliable and efficient management of healthcare supply chains crucial in enhancing health security and ensuring optimised resource utilisation.
