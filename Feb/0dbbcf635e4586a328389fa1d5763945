An athlete’s foot is a fungal infection affecting mainly the skin between the toes, caused by various types of fungi. It's common among people whose feet get sweaty when confined within tight/ closed spaces (shoes.) In such an environment, the fungi get warm and moist, they grow out of control and start to cause symptoms. However, it’s a myth that an athlete’s foot only affects the feet. One can actually get “athlete’s foot” on their arm, groin, underarm and under your nails as the fungi normally lives on the skin, hair, and nails called dermatophytes. But infections in these areas are sometimes referred to with other names like ringworm, jock itch or simply a fungal infection. The athlete’s foot is contagious and can be spread through direct contact with skin particles left on floors, towels, clothing, or shoes. That’s why it’s commonly associated with gym locker rooms and communal showers. The infection is characterized by an itchy red rash between the toes, peeling or scaling/ cracked skin between the toes, burning/ stinging sensation, skin peeling on the bottom of the foot, and small blisters. To avoid getting or managing an athlete's foot (if you already have the infection) ensure you follow the instructions below: Change your socks daily or twice a day if you play sports. Don’t wear the same pair of shoes repeatedly. Allow shoes to completely dry before wearing them again. When possible, go barefoot or wear sandals so as to let your feet breathe (and heal if you have the infection.) Wear socks that are not cotton to discourage fungal growth if going barefoot proves to be impractical for you. If you already have the infection ensure: It’s also essential to protect your feet when in public places, as the infection is spread via surfaces. Ensure you wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers, and lockers rooms to prevent contracting the fungal infection. And remember to thoroughly dry feet whenever they come into contact with water.
