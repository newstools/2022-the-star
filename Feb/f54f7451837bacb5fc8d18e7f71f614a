Langata parliamentary aspirant Silas Jakakimba has withdrawn from the race due to emerging issues. “Due to emerging and critical issues, assignment in the past several months, I've had to skip on my earlier intention to stand for elective public office," he said. "...Including the Lang'ata Parliamentary seat - where I will offer all the support to whoever emerges as the Change Movement's candidate." But he noted that he will continue playing his role at the Raila Odinga Secretariat. “This is to ensure Raila clinches the much-awaited decisive and resounding win on RAOND1 by CoB August 9th, 2022,” he said. “Even so, my desire to continue serving the people in the current and other capacities has never waned a bit.” The former personal assistant to then Prime Minister Raila Odinga, now ODM leader, believed the seat was his for the taking, “having lived in Lang’ata all my city life except when I was in school in Parklands". He now serves as Odinga's senior adviser at his Capitol Hill-based Raila Odinga Secretariat. Jakakimba is not new to active politics, having tried his hand in the Homa Bay senatorial by-election in 2015 after the death of Senator Otieno Kajwang’. He lost the nomination.
