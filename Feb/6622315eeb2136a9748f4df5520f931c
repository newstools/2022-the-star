Diamond Platnumz and his baby mama Zari Hassan have been featured in a new reality show about African celebrities. The Netflix show 'Young, Famous And African', will premier in March and has a touch of glitz and glamour, seggz, shade and scandal. Diamond took to social media to announce the show. "Another one for the culture! 18th March 2022 on Netflix! Young Famous And African." Zari added, "Africa like you've never seen before. It's glitz, it's glamour and just a touch of me. You can't miss this. Young, Famous and African arrives March 18. Only on Netflix." In the show, Diamond seems to open up about how he cheated on Zari Hassan and got a child with Hamisa Mobetto while still dating Zari. The two shot the show last year in South Africa.
