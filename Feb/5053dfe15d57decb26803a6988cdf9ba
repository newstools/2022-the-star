A court has issued a permanent order stopping a private developer from dealing with a 20-acre piece of land in Nairobi’s Industrial Area belonging to the Coffee Board of Kenya. Justice Lucy Mbugua declared the coffee board as the rightful owner of the land. She said any title held by Sotua Development Company Limited is illegal. She said the same be cancelled in the land register. The coffee board as represented by Miller and Co Advocates had during the hearing said the title was illegally issued to Sotua. It told the court it acquired the parcel in October 1986. The board said Sotua fraudulently acquired parallel documents in respect of the suit land hence the illegal title ought to be cancelled. The court said a letter of allotment issued to the Coffee board in 1986 in respect to the land was ever cancelled. “There being no evidence that the allotment to Coffee Board was ever cancelled, then I find that any acquisition of the land to another entity is null and void,” Mbugua said. The Judge dismissed claims of trespass as alleged by the other parties saying it has not been proved. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
