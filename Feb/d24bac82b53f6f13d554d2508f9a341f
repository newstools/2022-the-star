ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Saturday take his campaigns to Kilifi county. During his visit of the coastal county, Raila is expected to sell his Azimio la Umoja message to area residents as he banks on their support during the August 9 polls. The former Prime Minister has great support from the county of Kilifi which he seeks to cement further as he makes his fifth stab at the country's top job. Raila is expected to tour Ganze, Bemba, Kaloleni, Mariakani, and Rabai areas during his visit. His tour comes a day after he returned from a 10-day trip abroad, that saw him visit Ethiopia, India and Dubai. Deputy President William Ruto will on the other hand be on a charm offensive of three Eastern counties of Embu, Tharaka Nithi and Meru. Ruto who will be accompanied by his Kenya Kwanza coalition partners, Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetangula (Ford Kenya) will make at least five stopovers across four constituencies in the three counties. The places the DP is scheduled to visit include; Kirīī and Kīgumo markets in Embu, Kathwana in Tharaka-Nithi and Kiagu and Kariene markets in Meru county.
