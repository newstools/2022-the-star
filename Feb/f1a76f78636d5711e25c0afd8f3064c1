Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Thursday ordered a military invasion in Ukraine after a standoff between the two former members of the dissolved Union of Soviet Socialist Republic. The bone of contention is Ukraine's expression of interest to joint the US-led North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,  specifically set up at the height of  the Cold War  to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. At the the time, Nato was pitted against the Soviet Union-led Warsaw Pact set up to counterweight it. Russia's current concern is that an immediate neighbour and former member of the Union now wants to go to bed with its enemies. Of course there are other concerns beyond security such as Russia's multi-billion gas pipeline to Germany that cuts through Ukraine. But this does not justify Russia's forceful entry and occupation of Ukraine. Independent nations are free to join economic and security blocs where they feel their interests will be best served. Russia must know that the breakdown of the former Soviet Union is irreversible and its imperialistic tendencies have no place in the current world. This is not the first time it is annexing parts of Ukraine. It did this to Crimea in 2014. The UN must pronounce tough measures, not only against Russia, but other world bullies that use force to resuscitate their empires.
