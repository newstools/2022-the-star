Trade CAS David Osiany has said he will not be vying for any political seat in the August polls. In a statement on Tuesday, Osiany who vied for the Rongo parliamentary seat in the last election said he has made several consultations which have led to his decision to continue performing in government. "I have weighed and deeply considered the thought of pursuing electoral office in the 2022 election," Osiany said. "I have consulted my immediate and extended family. I have objectively ruminated and mulled over it with very close friends. I have also extensively consulted and deliberated on this with my party leader Raila Odinga." He added, "After the depth and span of these consultations, there is convergence of opinion to stay out the Rongo 2022 election and instead continue performing critical government assignments, especially during this crucial transition period." Osiany urged his supporters to understand his decision as he promised to serve his consistency even away from parliament. "Yes, leadership comes with the patriotic burden of making hard decisions, and where those decisions may be disappointing in the immediate term, in the long run they are more fulfilling," he said. "As I have traversed the nation and the world executing my assignment in the responsibility of Chief Administrative Secretary, I have come to the conclusion that I have always been right about this calling. I have always been right to obey my instinct of pursuing leadership. To pursue it with the single objective of transforming the lives of the people."
