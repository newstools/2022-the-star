A gang of armed bandits raided a police post in Isiolo County and killed one police officer before stealing two G3 rifles. The raiders of unknown number staged the raid on Monday at about 7pm. Police authorities said the post is usually manned by nine officers but at the time of the raid there were two on duty. Constable Francis Njeru was shot in the head and died on the spot. The gang went into the post and picked the two guns and foodstuffs that was there before escaping. Police suspect the raiders were from a neighboring county and were out to get the weapons for a mission at a later date. The body was moved to a local mortuary. The area is facing a number of challenges including drought and banditry attacks that have increased in the past months. Police spokesman Bruno Shioso said they are pursuing the attackers for justice. He added they are determined to recover the weapons.
