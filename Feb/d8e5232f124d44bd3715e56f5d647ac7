Gunmen riding on a motorcycle shot and killed an Iraqi national in a robbery of his mobile phone in Nairobi’s Lavington area. Hanna Mazini Matti, an employee of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), was jogging alone near his residence along Gitanga Road when three gunmen riding on a motorcycle struck on Friday at about 6.30 pm. Witnesses told police that the gunmen approached the victim and demanded his mobile phone and cash. The incident happened outside Muthangari Gardens. He resisted, prompting a brief tussle before he was shot in the right knee. The gang grabbed his mobile phone and rode off on a motorcycle whose registration numbers had been concealed. A police officer guarding a diplomatic residence near the area heard the commotion and shooting and rushed out, only to find the gang riding off. He shot at them but missed the target. Police who attended the scene said the gang rode towards Kawangware area and efforts to arrest them were ongoing. Nairobi deputy police boss James Mugera said the victim bled profusely as he was being rushed to the hospital by a Good Samaritan, who arrived at the scene. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. Mugera said no arrest had been made so far but his team was pursuing leads on the gang. He said they believe the gang was after the victim’s mobile phone. “They escaped on a motorcycle but we have faith they will be caught to face justice over the death of the man,” he said. He also advised those confronted by thugs to always cooperate at all costs. “Your life is more precious than money or a laptop or mobile phone. Some of these thugs are on drugs and any slight provocation or resistance will lead to other things,” he said.
