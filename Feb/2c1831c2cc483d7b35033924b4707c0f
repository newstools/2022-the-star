Isiolo County has officially launched its very own Gender Policy to help mainstream gender in the county’s policies and processes. The draft of the policy was introduced to the County Assembly of Isiolo in September 2021 and was unanimously passed by members of the assembly. The policy was drafted by the Center for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW) and the Kenya Women Parliamentarians Association (KEWOPA). Wangechi Wachira, CREAW-Kenya’s Executive Director, said they have been working with the county for the last four years to achieve this. “Over the last four years, CREAW worked with KEWOPA, women’s rights groups, and the County Government of Isiolo to strengthen accountability for gender-based violence laws,” she said. She lauded the county for such a progressive move towards ensuring gender equality and protecting women, girls, and youth in Isiolo. The law provides a clear framework for the implementation of this policy with concrete measures to prevent Sexual Gender-Based Violence, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and radicalisation of youth to violent extremist groups. Wachira said that the policy (SGBV) also makes essential services available to survivors of SGBV. “Inclusion of women and girls in policy and development processes is critical for a gender-equal society. Beyond the launch, we want to see the implementation fast-tracked to deliver safety nets and progress for women and girls,” she said. She expressed hope that more counties will follow Isiolo’s example, with six counties already having enacted Gender Policies in their respective counties.
