The grandson of late Kenya's second president Daniel Toroitich arap Moi has been evicted in a house over rent arrears. Collins Kibet Toroitich was removed from the house for failing to pay a six months rent amounting to Sh240,000. The grandson has sued his stepmother Sylvia Jonathan and stepbrother Clint Kiprono Moi for trying to disinherit him. Kibet in court papers said the grandfather's wealth is in excess of Sh300 billion.
