Kenya Police head coach John Bobby Ogolla has lashed out at the referee for denying them what he described as ‘a genuine goal’ during their Kenyan Premier League match against Wazito at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. Ogolla also threw the gauntlet to his custodian Reuben Juma to polish his act after he let in two easy goals that led to their 3-2 defeat. “It's up to him to pull up. What can we do? He should know where the mistake is. He saved us before like the last game was supposed to be a 4-0 defeat but it ended up being a 1-0 defeat so he saved us and it is not good to crucify him,” said Ogolla. “The loss is a big concern to me but coaches don't play. I only need to keep hammering the winning mentality into the heads of the players,” he said. Wazito head coach Mike Amwayi said Saturday's win was well-strategized and didn't come as a surprise. “We knew that the only way we could beat Police was to take the battle to them in their own half, force them to crack and capitalise on the opportunities,” said Amwayi. “The victory wasn't by fluke. It is something we had planned well for and I thank the players for executing the plan. Right now they are in their right senses after their needs were addressed,” he added. Skipper Elly Asieche fired Wazito ahead early in the game before Clifton Miheso restored parity from the spot in the 25th minute after Rooney Onyango was adjudged to have handled the ball inside the box. Wazito restored their lead in the 34th minute through John Kuol and stretched their lead further through Amos Ekhalie on the stroke of halftime. The law enforcers reduced the deficit in the 66th minute through Charles Ouma.
