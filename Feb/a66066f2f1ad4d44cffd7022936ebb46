Samidoh's wife Edday Nderitu was thrown a surprise baby shower by her close friends over the weekend. It was a pink, white and gold affair held at the Avery Lounge. In attendance was Karen Nyamu's political rival Julie Kabogo, who is Edday's best friend. Nyamu and Edday are running for the Senator seat in Nairobi. Edday is expecting her third child with the Mugithi singer. Karen Nyamu and Samidoh also share a child together and this was announced by the singer last year, saying he will take care of his son. Nyamu is also expecting her third child. "I was a bit shocked but it eventually became exciting, pregnancy is an exciting phase for any mother. I can't wait to meet my baby," she said in a past interview.
