A European Union-wide ban for Russian flights could be part of a fresh package of sanctions on Moscow to be discussed later on Sunday by the bloc's foreign ministers, an EU official said. A vast majority of EU member states have already closed their airspace to these flights, and a more formal decision could be taken shortly, the official added.
