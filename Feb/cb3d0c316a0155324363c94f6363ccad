The chocolates, wine and cheese festival, organized by Sheyxs events, was held at the pop-up market in Westgate mall. It featured a variety of stands that were keen on showcasing different brands of wine from all over the globe, teaching those in attendance how to pair the wines as well as what goes best with what. On top of that, there were chocolates stands as well and lots of cheese paired with special sauces and wines. Individuals participated in paint and sip, where at a fee you get a canvas and paint to bring your artistic skills to life as well as complimentary wine. Most pop-up stalls offered free samples of their items to individuals who attended the event, letting them get a feel of things and let them decide if they wish to make purchases. Cheese was in plenty as it has a thousand varieties and it pairs well with dry red wines and sweet whites as well. They also go well with fruits and specific sauces depending on the type of cheese. Attendees got to learn about wine pairing, wine glasses, meals that go with which wines and a lot more as well as try out free samples of the wines on display.
