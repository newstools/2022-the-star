The National Transport and Safety Authority is carrying out a crackdown on unroadworthy vehicles countrywide. Police officers along the Eastern Bypass on Monday impounded vehicles that do not meet the NTSA guidelines. This exercise has forced many Kenyans to walk for long distances because the vehicles they were travelling in were found to be faulty and unroadworthy. The operations are being conducted by officers from NTSA, National Police Service, alongside local provincial administrations and other actors. Last week, Government Spokesman Cyrus Oguna said at least 1, 700 motor vehicles have been impounded in the ongoing national Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) crackdowns. Oguna said the vehicles were impounded across the country. Their drivers and owners were arraigned in the last three days since the government launched the operations on various roads on Monday. He said the operations were ongoing for a month, 30 days. The crackdown will, among others, target drivers who have installed strobe or flashing lights, those with foreign number plates without motor vehicle foreign permits and illegal public service vehicles, which include illegal public service vehicles that operate at night. Dozens of NTSA personnel who had been working at various driving schools have been deployed to various roads for major operations. It is the reason motorists have seen increased operations on the roads targeting rogue drivers.
