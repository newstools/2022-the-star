Mshikaki is a skewered meat delicacy that has a little African, Middle Eastern and Indian influence to it. It’s an all-around meal that’s not only popular on the streets but is also served in restaurants, unlike other street foods. Mishikaki can be eaten as appetizers or served on a bed of any rice/ wheat dish to make a meal. Beef and chicken pieces are most popular when it comes to preparing the meal but fish is also used sometimes, although rare. Cubes of steak are marinated, then skewered, and grilled until tender. The results are succulent, moist, and delicious barbecued meat pieces. They are somewhat similar to the desi beef boti. Mishikaki are usually grilled on the charcoal barbecue to give them a smoked flavour, but they can be done on a  gas barbecue as well, or on a skillet. Ingredients Method Prepare the marinade paste in a large bowl by mixing tamarind, oil, salt, black pepper, cumin, ginger garlic paste and soy sauce then set aside. Cut your meat into cubes then add them to the marination paste and mix them up until well all the pieces are covered with the marination paste. Cover the bowl and set it aside. Note: If you're not in a hurry, refrigerate the marinated meat overnight to allow them to absorb the flavours better. Wash your bell peppers and onions and dice them into large pieces. Using the skewers, pierce the cubed meat and drag it till almost the end of the skewer. Add onions, and bell peppers in between the meat and continue with the process of arranging your ingredients as desired. Place the filled skewers over a well-lit charcoal barbecue grill and allow your meat to cook, brushing them once in a while with the remaining marination paste while changing sides. This will help make the meat moist. Once ready, take the skewers out of the grill and place them on a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with an accompaniment of your favourite side dish or enjoy them on their own.
