Kilifi County Gubernatorial Candidate George Kithi's campaigns received a major boost on Saturday after Michael Tinga who was eyeing the same seat on a Ford Kenya ticket dropped his bid in his favour. Tinga made the declaration during a Pamoja African Alliance party (PAA) rally in the Chanagande Chonyi area of Kaloleni constituency of Kilifi County. Christine Zawadi is eyeing the Kilifi Woman Rep, senatorial candidate Ben Kai and Kaloleni parliamentary candidate Edward Saro were present. Tinga said he resolved to drop his bid in favour of Kithi because of his vision to transform Kilifi and offer free education for all children once elected. Tinga said Kithi was the preferred governor for Kilifi because he will also revive the collapsed cashew nut industry to create job opportunities and also transform the lives of people. "That is his agenda and that is my agenda, for that reason when we get together we will work together and deliver," he said. The former gubernatorial candidate said at the end of the day, the people of Kilifi are going to choose one governor and that's why he resolved to support Kithi. He reminded the residents that just like ODM party leader Raila Odinga who said Kibaki Tosha, he also was supporting Kithi's ambition. Tinga said his people of Chonyi fully support the idea of him joining the PAA brigade and ensuring Kithi becomes the second governor of Kilifi. On his part, Kithi welcomed Tinga's endorsement. "We sat down and resolved that we unite to build Kilifi so team George Kithi and team Michael Tinga have come together to ensure that we deliver to the people of Kilifi," he said. Saro who is eying the Kaolole  Parliamentary seat called on residents to vote for all PAA candidates in the county. Kithi will now battle for the seat against former Devolution CAS and ODM Gubernatorial candidate Gideon Mung'aro, UDA's Aisha Jumwa, Alphonce Dzombo Mbaru of Safina Party, and Franco Esposito an Independent candidate.
