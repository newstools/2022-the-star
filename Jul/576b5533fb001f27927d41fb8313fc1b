The outgoing Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua has endorsed Wiper gubernatorial candidate Wavinya Ndeti as his successor. Mutua said the former Transport CAS was the best candidate among those contesting for the seat to take over from where he will leave as far as running the county matters are concerned. He said he will himself vote for Ndeti as his governor on August 9th polls. "I want to announce to the Kamba community that I have worked for you for ten years. I am now leaving you as the Machakos governor. I want to tell you who I will leave you with as your next governor," Mutua said. "My vote I will give to Wavinya Ndeti because she is the one who can bring development to Machakos County. I defeated Wavinya Ndeti several times. I will vote for Deputy President William Ruto as my fifth President, Rita Ndunge (woman representative) and Wavinya Ndeti as my governor. " The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader spoke during a Kenya Kwanza political rally at Machakos town on Saturday. The rally was led by Kenya Kwanza Presidential candidate William Ruto. Those battling Ndeti for the seat include CCU party leader Nzioka Waita, UDA national chairman Johnson Muthama and ELP party leader Rose Mulwa. Mutua made this move after his deputy and Maendeleo Chap Chap Machakos gubernatorial candidate Francis Maliti withdrew his bid in Ndeti's favour days ago.
