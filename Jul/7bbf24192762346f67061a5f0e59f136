England’s Dina Asher-Smith has withdrawn from the Commonwealth Games with a “light hamstring strain”. Asher-Smith pulled up with the injury while competing for Great Britain in the women’s 4x100m relay final at the World Championships on Monday. She had won bronze in the 200m at the event just a few days before and she needs “a few days off” to protect the minor problem. “(There are) no major issues and nothing to worry about,” she said. Asher-Smith came third in the 200m at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast four years ago. She also won gold as part of the England 4x100m relay team. “I feel good but I am in need of a few days off,” she wrote on Instagram. “But due to the short turnaround between the end of the Worlds and the start of the Commonwealth Games in a few days' time, I’m going to have to withdraw.” Equally to have pulled out of the games is England 800m runner Max Burgin after developing a deep vein thrombosis in his right calf. The 20-year-old, the fastest man in the world this year over 800m, pulled out of last week’s World Championships with the problem. “It’s gutting to have now missed out on two major champs over a medical issue that came out of nowhere,” Burgin said. He thought he had strained his calf before further tests showed it was DVT, a blood clot that usually develops in the leg and can lead to more serious health issues if it breaks away and travels to other parts of the body. He missed last year’s Tokyo Olympics after suffering hamstring and groin injuries. “This DVT is something that can be fixed easily and relatively quickly,” Burgin said. “It just seems like terrible bad luck, but I’m sure soon my fortunes will change and I’ll be competing regularly at future champs.”
