Residents of Romomo, Kanyekini and Nyambare have asked the Kenya Wildlife Service to remove all hyenas attacking and killing their domestic animals from the area. They say that they have been left counting losses following the massive loss of sheep and goats when the hyenas attacked. On Saturday, a resident Mugo wa Muiruri said the wild animals come to their villages from neighbouring Uplands Forest. “They normally come looking for something to eat. They attack our sheep and goats at home and along the roadside,” Muiruri said. He revealed that they reported those incidences to the assistant chief’s offices, the forest officer in charge of Uplands and KWS. “The KWS however visited us with a trap and placed it near the forest,” he said. One hyena was caught by the KWS trap and screamed attracting the attention of the residents. James Kanyiri, a watchman said when the hyena was trapped, four other hyenas came to check. “The hyenas came and camped at the trap but left at dawn,” he said. KWS officers took the hyena to the Nairobi Game Reserve. Another resident Simon Cuaga said the KWS should place more traps in the area to control the hyena menace. “We are going back to many years ago when we used to be disturbed by hyenas in this area. KWS should add more traps to keep out wild animals,” Cuaga said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
