Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto will on Saturday take his campaigns to Kajiado and Narok counties. His itinerary will start in Namanga in Kajiado South Constituency before heading to Kitengela in Kajiado East Constituency. The trail will then head to Supa Nkapu in Narok before proceeding Ntulele in Narok East Constituency. The DP will then camp at Sogoo in Narok South Constituency and finish his campaigns at Lolgorian in Kilgoris Constituency. Ruto had on Friday taken his campaigns to Kilifi and Mombasa Counties. Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will on the other hand be campaigning in Murang'a county. He will be accompanied by leaders allied to the coalition to drum up support for their bid. He had on Friday taken his campaigns to Bungoma and Trans Nzoia. The 2022 general election has been touted as the most competitive with a lot at stake for the two leading presidential contenders. Raila is making his fifth, and probably, the last attempt at becoming Kenya’s commander-in-chief while the DP is on his maiden attempt to occupy State House, failure to which he will be secluded in the opposition at least for the next five years.
