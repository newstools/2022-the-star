The first batch of Team Kenya to the 2022 World Championships in Oregon set for between July 15 and 24 are set to leave the country tonight for the United States of America. Team manager Rono Bunei clarified that the athletes will travel in batches depending on the dates of their respective competitions. "The first set of athletes will be leaving tonight (Monday). We have been camping at Moi Stadium, Kasarani for the last two weeks and I believe our athletes will yield good results," said Bunei. "It's time for Kenyans to be happy," added Bunei, while expressing his optimism with the 3,000m steeplechase team of eight. "They (Steeplechasers) have been very disciplined and we have not brushed shoulders the wrong way," Bunei said. "The marathon team is in Eldoret and they will be joining the others before July 18. We have split the athletes according to their events." Meanwhile, Bunei revealed it will be impossible to replace Olympic champion Peres Jepchirchir, who is set to miss the Worlds through injury. This leaves defending champion Ruth Chepngétich, Judith Jeptum and Angela Tanui with the task of ensuring Kenya retains the title. Bunei added that athletes doubling at both Oregon and Commonwealth Games are scheduled to fly to Birmingham on July 24/25. "The athletes who will be going to double will leave for Birmingham on either July 24 or July 25 as planned by the Ministry of Sports and Athletics Kenya. Those who do not have visas for United Kingdom will come back to the country and then travel back. All athletes who are traveling tonight have their visas," Bunei said. The last batch of athletes are expected to leave the country on July 17.
