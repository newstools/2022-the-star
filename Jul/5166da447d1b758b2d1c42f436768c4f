Dandora-based battle-rapper Harrison Ouma, alias Heavyweight, was inspired by the likes of Kalamasha, Zakah and the Vigeti while growing up. In a statement, The Tusker Nexster talent also credited his family for playing a major role in his career. “My mother is a big inspiration to me, as well as my brothers. From my pen game to how I present myself to the workings of the music game, I am forever grateful to my parents for making me into the person and the artiste I am today.” Ouma also cited Jua Cali and Nyashinki as artistes he looks up to. His nickname came about as a result of people in his hood recognising him from his exploits during rap battles and his freestyles, and referring to him as ‘Mzito’.
