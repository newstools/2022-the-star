Shujaa bowed out of the quarterfinals of the Commonwealth Games rugby after losing to holders New Zealand 31-0 at the Coventry Stadium. The champions dominated possession and territory and scored the opener courtesy of Mcgarvey Black who converted his own try for a 7-0 lead. Regan Ware then struck on the stroke of halftime as the Kiwis led 12-0 at the interval. On resumption, the All-Black Sevens stepped up a gear with further tries to Ware, Dylan Collier, and skipper Scott Curry to end Kenyan hopes of a medal in the event.
