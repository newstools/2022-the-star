If we burn this country, we will have nowhere to go. By parading their differences on social media, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and DCI boss George Kinoti are sowing seeds of discord. While the objective of their actions might be fuelled by the desire to be transparent, a calm and private way would suffice. The two institutions must exercise decorum and guarantee the public that they are acting independently and in strict compliance with the law. With less than two weeks to the polls, the IEBC must act and demonstrate its independence as it fulfils its duties. But this does not mean it does not owe the public clarification on emerging issues. Raising critical issues on social media sets the stage for politicising the subject matter, hence, diminishing the chances of a candid and objective discussion that is key to finding a solution. Kenya's current delicate state makes professionalism on the part of the DCI imperatively important. Sensitive information must be kept away from the public to prevent sparking emotions among citizens. The law dictates plainly how the DCI should handle situations. Bickering on social media is not part of this process. Prosecuting cases in the realm of public opinion will only exacerbate the already volatile situation, leading to impartial and emotionally charged decision-making.
