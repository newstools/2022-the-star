Prices in Turkey are rising at their fastest rate in 24 years, according to the latest official figures. The annual rate of inflation, the pace at which prices rise, hit 78.62 percent in June, which was slightly higher than expectations. Transport costs and housing saw some of the sharpest price rises, worsened by the Ukraine war. Inflation has surged since last year, when the Turkish president cut interest rates to try to boost the economy. Usually countries would increase interest rates in an attempt to cool inflation. But President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described interest rates as "the mother and father of all evil", and has used more unorthodox policy to try to dampen prices including intervening in foreign exchange markets. Last year's cut in interest rates from 19 percent to 14 percent has led to a fall in the value of the Turkish lira, which means it costs more for the country to import goods from abroad. In the latest inflation figures, transportation saw the biggest rise in costs, climbing 123 percent over the past year. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were close behind with price rises of 94 percent, while the cost of furnishings and household equipment was up 81 percent. The overall inflation figure was the highest since September 1998, when annual inflation hit 80.4 percent and Turkey was battling to end a decade of chronically high inflation.
