Government spokesman Cyrus Oguna has said they will arrest and prosecute those selling unga above Sh100. He said that small-scale traders will also be compensated in the government payment to cushion them from losses. "We are looking into all traders to ensure they do not incur losses whether big or small we will have a good modality to accommodate everyone," he said. He spoke in Meru on Friday where he assessed government projects. In Meru, he accessed the progress of Kinoru stadium and tarmacking of several roads and storage facilities. He said the government will build more storage facilities to help farmers avoid post-harvest losses. "80 per cent of post-harvest losses are lost due to lack of proper storage facilities," he said. He acceded a modern storage facility for potato farmers in the Buuri constituency in Meru. "Losses can be avoided by the construction of such facilities," Oguna said. On fuel prices, he said the war between Ukraine and Russia is to blame as Russia is one of the biggest oil producers and is not supplying the international market. He cautioned the youth against engaging in violence during the electioneering period.
