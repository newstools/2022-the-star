The anti-graft agency has said it is pursuing a recovery of salaries earned by public officials with fake academic papers. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said on Monday that too many public officials have forged academic papers to attain their positions or get promoted to senior posts. But it is actively investigating unnamed individuals and will require them to refund the public the money they have acquired. "Forgery of academic certificates has become prevalent in the public service. This is not only a crime but also a violation of Chapter six of the Constitution," it said. "EACC is investigating suspected public officials and will seek to recover salaries earned on fake academic qualifications." The country is set to commemorate Africa Anti-Corruption Day on July 12. The event will be held at Strathmore University under the theme "Elect Leaders of Integrity to Enhance Transparency and Accountability." The question of fake academic papers has been in the headlines for weeks as some politicians battle to be on the ballot in next month's general election. Institutions of higher learning have in the past flagged the problem of forgery of academic papers in the country to attain job placement or promotion. For example, Kisumu-based Great Lakes University (GLUK) last month flagged 169 undergraduate degrees being held by students who enrolled in a college based in Eldoret as fake. Through a newspaper notice on June 23, the university said 169 students were using its name to mint money. The institution cautioned members of the public to do due diligence before giving out money to entities purporting to dispense credible academic programmes. Edited by A.N
