Kenya National Highways Authority has urged transporters to always comply with stipulated axle load limits to avoid hefty fines. KeNHA Assistant Director in charge of axle load Michael Ngala said on Thursday that the authority desires compliance and not fines. He urged truckers to comply. Ngala said the Sh6000 fines paid by detained trucks over non-compliance aimed at deterring the destruction of road assets through overloading. "We take no pleasure in collecting these fines. But the law, as stipulated must be implemented,” Ngala said. He spoke at Gilgil weighbridge while on an inspection tour. This was aimed at compliance at large. Ngala said the fines are similar to those charged by Kenya Revenue Authority(KRA) for those who delay filing their returns. KRA charges Sh10,000 fine to taxpayers who delay in making their annual tax returns on June 30, every year. Ngala said the axle load enforcement unit has engaged the Kenya Transporters Association(KTA), the Kenya Association of Manufacturers(KAM) and the Kenya Private Sector Alliance(KEPSA) to enhance compliance. He said the stakeholder engagement is in compliance with the Constitution of Kenya's requirement for continuous public participation. The inspection continues to other areas in the country. Some transporters have been complaining the fines are punitive. They also complain of being detained for long whenever they are caught with overloaded lorries, an issue the authorities said is necessary. The authority has dozens of police officers attached to them to help in enforcing some of the laws.
