Olympic 800 metres champion Emmanuel Korir is confident Kenya will continue with their good run in the two-lap race in Oregon as they prepare to parade at the World Athletics Championships. Kenyans have won the Olympic gold in the last four editions and Olympic Korir believes it's time for the glory to transition to the World Championships. Korir will represent Kenya in the 800m alongside Wycliffe Kinyamal, Emmanuel Wanyonyi and Noah Kibet. The quartet will go through the heats on July 21 at 3:20 am. They will then proceed to the semi-finals on the next day (5 am) and the final on July 24 at 4:10 am. This being his third time representing Kenya at the World Championships, Korir has expressed his excitement and optimism that they are likely to sweep the board in the event. "I'm super excited to be representing my country for the third time at  World Championships. At my level (Olympic Champion), I still need a strong team because it gives me the morale to push for victory. I can't wait to lead a Kenyan medal sweep," he bragged. Wycliffe Kinyamal, who is the Commonwealth Games champion, is equally elated to make his first appearance at the World Championships and has exuded confidence that something good awaits him despite the stiff competition. The Commonwealth 800m champion is also targeting to finish in the medal bracket despite an anticipated tight competition. "This is my first time attending the World Championships and I am going to fight for any medal. My win during the trials gives me hope that I am destined for something good in Oregon," Kinyamal said.
