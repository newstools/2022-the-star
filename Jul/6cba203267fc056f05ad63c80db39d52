The court has found police officers Stephen Cheburet and Sylvia Wanjiku played a part in the murder of the deceased persons. The two in their defense had argued that they were not at the police post when the victims were taken there. However, the court has dismissed the defense, saying even phone information places them at the post. "The third accused reigning ignorance does not mean she is innocent since the argument that she was following orders of her bosses is not a defense,” Judge Jessie Lessit said. Sylvia was a junior officer at the police post where the case was reported. The court has said that Cheburet was involved in the murder because phone data puts him at the scene of the crime. There is evidence from his cellphone connecting him to the incident. Judge Jessie Lessit has further ruled that Sylvia is a principal offender and she cannot say she was not aware the deceased were in that cell. Police officers Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and police informer Peter Ngugi were charged with their murder. The three victims were abducted from their car as they left Mavoko law courts, where Willie had gone with Mwenda his client. Their bodies were later found dumped at the Oldonyo Sabuk River wrapped in black gunny bags. According to police, after their abduction, they were held for a few hours at the Syokimau police post before they were taken to a field where they were killed one after the other. The prosecution had asked the court to convict all the accused persons saying they each played a part in the murder.
