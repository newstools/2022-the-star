A court in Egypt has called for a legal amendment to allow live broadcast of the execution of the killer of a female student. Egyptians were horrified after video footage went viral last month purportedly showing Mohammed Adel stabbing to death Nayera Ashraf, who rejected his advances, outside her university. In a letter to parliament, the court that sentenced the 22-year-old to death said the broadcast of even a part of the proceedings could achieve the goal of deterrence. Egypt does not broadcast executions, which are always carried out by hanging inside prisons. A 2015 United Nations survey said nearly eight million Egyptian women were victims of violence.
