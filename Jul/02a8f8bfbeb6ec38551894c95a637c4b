Kenya Kwanza running mate Rigathi Gachagua angered Nyeri journalists on Monday after he made comments that they termed were inciting the public against them. After concluding his speech, journalists hurriedly left the venue of the meeting fearing supporters would turn against them. The meeting, convened by Gachagua and attended by hundreds of grassroots leaders from Kieni, was meant to drum up support for Kieni parliamentary aspirant Njoroge Wainaina. Making his remarks, the politician accused journalists of misrepresenting facts and told them that UDA will win even without their input. “You have recorded enough you news people. And don’t alter facts the way you always do. Do you know these people alter facts?,” he said. “We shall win this election even without your help,” he added. Gachagua said the media has been manipulating his comments and writing what fits their agenda going on to say that, after winning, he will build a house at Kakuret in Kieni. He said the money he will use to build the house will be his own salary and he can do what he wants with it, telling the media to go ahead and misrepresent what he said. Gachagua even went as far as mentioning one journalist by name and the name of the vernacular radio station (Kameme FM) adding that its presenters in Nairobi are always biased. “But we know the radio station is owned by Uhuru Kenyatta’s family. Or don’t you know that,” he posed. “These people attack Rigathi Gachagua every morning. But they will take us nowhere; we shall beat them in the elections.” By press time, Nyeri media were holding a meeting in Nyeri town to deliberate on the next course of action.
