Wimbledon doubles junior champion Angela Okutoyi crashed out of the Monastir futures tournament in Tunisia after losing to Marie Villet of France 6-1, 6-0. Okutoyi was hoping to go on a good run in the event but the Frenchwoman dominated the match from the first serve as Okutoyi made several unforced errors on the hard court surface. The Africa junior champion has two tournaments in Monastir to bounce back from the defeat. She said she will use the next week to make amends and ensure he is ready for the assignment ahead. "It's back to the drawing board for me. I believe I can play better and will be well prepared next time,” added Okutoyi. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion said despite the setback of an early exit, she hopes to bounce back in subsequent tournaments. "I'm not disappointed. There are certain aspects of my game that were not right in the match but with a further week of training, I am sure I will improve," she said. Okutoyi said it will take time to adjust to the hard court surface having played on grass for the past two months. "I know it will take a while to adjust but I have time on my side with the US Open starting in late August,” she noted. Okutoyi, who is currently ranked 1526 in the women's singles ranking, is hopeful of moving up the rankings come the end of the US Open. “I am confident my ranking will improve by the time we are done with the final Grand Slam of the year,” said Okutoyi Monastir has never been a good hunting ground for Okutoyi having retired in the first round after sustaining a shoulder injury against Tanuchaporn Yongmod of Thailand in December After the Monastir Open, Okutoyi will grace the J1 Repentigny tournament from August 28 to September 3 in Canada, and then the US Open Junior Championship scheduled for September 4-10 in New York.
