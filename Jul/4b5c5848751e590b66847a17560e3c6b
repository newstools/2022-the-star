The national women’s hockey team, Blades, suffered a massive 8-0 defeat at the hands of 2018 silver medalists Australia on Saturday. It was Kenya's second straight loss in the games following another 16-0 mauling by reigning champions New Zealand on Friday. The defeat dimmed Kenya's hopes of a maiden Commonwealth quarterfinals appearance. They face Scotland in a dead rubber encounter on Monday. Kaitlin Nobbs was the toast for the victors, netting a hattrick in the one-sided encounter. Shanea Tonkin bagged a brace with Claire Colwill, Stephanie Kershaw and Grace Stewart scoring a goal apiece.
