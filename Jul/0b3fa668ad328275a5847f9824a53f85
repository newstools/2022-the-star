A 52-year-old man was found dead at a lodging in the wee hours of the morning an incident that shocked residents of West Kinyarwanda. Police officers in Nyatike, Migori county are questioning a 24-year-old woman following the incident as it is alleged he was the boyfriend. Directorate of criminal investigations George Kinoti said the man's lifeless body was discovered sprawled on a bed at a lodging after they spent a night with the woman. "Police were called at the scene and established that the 52-year-old man had walked into the room accompanied by the woman half his age, and collapsed hours later following an eventful evening," Kinoti said. The deceased’s body has since been moved to Migori level IV mortuary, awaiting postmortem to establish the exact cause of death. In a similar incident in April, two men and a woman were found dead while holding each other in lodging in Nairobi’s Pipeline area in a bizarre incident. The trio, whose lips were intercrossed, held each other, witnesses and police said. But one of the men was bleeding from the mouth and nose when the bodies were discovered. Police termed the incident a puzzle but added they are investigating the deaths to establish what happened at the lodging. The detectives handling the incident said they suspect a cult to be the motive behind it. There was, however, no sign of break-in or struggle in the room, which made the police conclude it might be suicide.
