Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has rejected nominations lists of 79 political parties submitted to the agency for consideration. IEBC Chairperson Wafula Chebukati on Friday said the Commission reviewed the party lists and none was compliant. "None of the seventy-nine lists submitted was compliant and thus stands a chance of rejection for various reasons," Chebukati said. He added the parties are required to review the list within seven days from the rejection date and resubmit it to the Commission. Chebukati said the political parties are required to comply with this requirement. The commission chair previously said it may reject a nominee submitted for any elective posts if they are not qualified. A party participating in the general election was required to submit lists of all persons who would be nominated if the party is entitled to the seats. Different political parties granted a soft landing to their loyalists rejected by voters at party nominations. Orange Democratic Movement nominated John Mbadi for National Assembly, Catherine Mumma, Beth Syengo, Rosemary Wanjiku, Sunjeev Birdi and Florence Mutua for Senate. United Democratic Alliance (UDA) handed Laikipia Woman rep Cate Waruguru and Starehe MP  Charles Kanyi nomination to the National Assembly. UDA secretary general Veronica Nduati, Bomet Woman Rep Joyce Korir, Karen Nyamu, MPs Peris Tobiko and Soipan Tuya were nominated for Senate. Musalia Mudavadi ANC Party nominated its secretary general Simon Mwangi Kamau, current nominated MP Petronila Were, Salim Busaidy and Charles Matoke for the National Assembly position. Wiper secretary general Shakila Abdalla and nominated MP Sylvia Kasanga were nominated by Wiper for the Senate.
