Aspiring Nairobi Governor Johnson Sakaja has been at the centre of a storm over his university degree. This is after it emerged that he never graduated from the University of Nairobi despite enrolling for a degree in Actuarial Science in 2003. He, however, presented a degree from Teams University Uganda for clearance to vie for the governor's seat. While revealing why he did not finish his studies at the UoN, Sakaja said he lacked fees. The remarks sparked a storm yet again considering he fashioned himself as a businessman who made a killing while in UoN. In an interview with Churchill Show in June 2021, he revealed that he bought his first car and a house while in University. Speaking during an interview on Churchill's show he shared: "Under my desk, I had a photo of a Mercedes car. Every time I made a noise I would remind myself to focus. I bought my Mercedes in 2017." How did he buy it? "I had a salon, laundry, Kinyozi, washing guys' clothes. Every day I had an extra 6,000. I had some resources because I bought the car for 500,000. By the time I was in my fourth year I had an apartment in Yaya." Sharing an incident in which he lost his sunroof, Sakaja narrated, "I was going to Nakuru before I started feeling cold. I could also hear people honking at me, that is when I realized the sunroof was missing. I had to go back and look for it. On my way, I saw a boda guy carrying the sunroof and he refused to give it to me. I had to buy it back." Sakaja says he learnt later that the car belonged to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula. "Later in life is that he used to see the car at Serena during my gym sessions. He told me if he knew I was the one he would have sold it to me at half price." Sakaja said he landed his first job at the age of 19 at Pricewatercoopers (PwC) where he worked for one year. He has also worked as a cyber attendant. At age 27 he became the Chairman of The National Alliance Party (TNA).
