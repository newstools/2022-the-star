A High Court has charged two former Nairobi County employees accused of abuse of office and uttering false documents. Former Nairobi County Chief Finance officer Jimmy Kiamba and former County Secretary Lilian Ndegwa were fined Sh9.6 million each or spend 12 years in prison in a Sh 18 million graft case. High court Judge Esther Maina passed the sentence after she overturned a decision by a Magistrates court issued in 2018 that acquitted the two. Former head of treasury Stephen Osiro, on the other hand, has been fined Sh1.2 million or 3 years in prison and former senior secretary at Department of Finance Regina Rotich was fined Sh1 million or spend 3 years. All four are former employees of Nairobi County. Justice Maina said the trial Magistrate Kennedy Bidali erred when he acquitted them when there was sufficient evidence that they committed the crime. Bidali in 2018 acquitted the four saying the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond any reasonable doubt. "After analyzing evidence adduced in court by prosecution witnesses, I find there is no evidence to warrant conviction of the accused persons. I, therefore, acquit them under section 215 of the Criminal Procedure." While clearing them, the magistrate said the prosecution had not shown that the five accused persons had a common mind to defraud Nairobi. The four were facing seven counts of abuse of office and uttering false documents. They had denied siphoning more than Sh18 million from their employer within one year over. They allegedly obtained monies fraudulently from Nairobi County’s account at Co-operative Bank between January 1 and December 31, 201 The Judge directed they be produced before Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi on July 18 for further directions. Judge Maina said Kiamba and Ndegwa acted "in blatant violation of the law governing public procurement and ought not to have been acquitted,"
