Following their fourth-place finish at the Prinsloo Sevens, KCB have set their sights on winning the Kakamega Sevens this weekend. The bankers, who won the opening leg — the Kabeberi Sevens — lost the Christie final to Strathmore and have made it to three Cup semifinals AT DriftwooD, Dala and Prinsloo sevens to sit second on the log with 90 points. However, KCB's quest to retain the title they won in 2019 will only be possible if leaders Menengai Oilers (95 points) fail to reach the cup quarters in Kakamega. KCB sevens coach Dennis Mwanja expressed optimism that they can win go a step further and bag the Kakamega Sevens title. “It has been a bittersweet experience for us in the series. Our campaign has been marred by injuries to key players, which affected our momentum. We had switch players to different positions," said Mwanja. "We also made mistakes that have proved costly. It is time for us to regroup, reorganise and strategise for the final showpiece in Kakamega.” In Nakuru, the bankers missed the services of Eugene Omondi and Trevor Odawa, who suffered injuries at the Dala Sevens in Kisumu the previous weekend. Forward Bob Muhati is also out of the competition with an ankle injury. The bankers had mixed performances in the Rift valley beating Quins 24-12 and Impala 7-0 before losing their final pool match 19-15 to Nondies but still qualified for the quarterfinals. In the last eight, they beat Mwamba 12-7 but fell 19-14 to Menengai Oilers in the semis. This was the second defeat in two tournaments against the leaders. In the bronze medal match,  KCB lost 21-10 to Homeboyz. Meanwhile, Strathmore Leos' George Ooro was named the Most Valuable player of the Prinsloo Sevens after scoring eight tries for the students, who lost 12-7 to Oilers in the final. Kenya sevens international and Nondies back Ben Salem was the top point scorer with 48. Salem had six tries and nine conversions as Nondies won the Challenge trophy.
