Jua Cali's wife Lily Asigo sparked reactions on social media after she advised women to have sex up to four times a week. Asigo said women who have difficulties enjoying sex with their husbands are haunted by evil spirits and need deliverance. The newly born-again mother of three added that fasting is a major sexual boost, adding that saved people have more meaningful sex. Speaking during the launch of King Kaka's film 'Kamtupe', Asigo said people had different opinions but emphasised that couples should communicate about intimacy. "Sex is very healthy and you need to communicate with your partner to find out if he is okay with once a week or four times," she said. Asigo added that most couples are not on the same page when it comes to intimacy, which makes the marriage fail. Jua Cali, who was with his wife, said his heart skipped when he read the statement. "But again, I knew many couples would understand her message," he said. "For single people, they would not get the statement. I felt the message targeted couples living together in the same house." He said intimacy keeps marriages and the more couples have it, the more their love tightens. Asigo recently quit alcohol, saying she now wants to focus on God.
