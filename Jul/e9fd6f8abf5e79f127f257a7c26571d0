The running mate of Kisii Kenya National Congress governor candidate Manson Oyongo has defected. Alfred Ndemo jumped ship to ODM's Simba Arati camp on Wednesday. Ndemo made the announcement about his defection at a rally in Kitutu Chache North. His decision to join Arati, he said, was informed by ODM party's rising popularity. Oyongo said he learnt of Ndemo's defection on radio. He however termed the defection 'inconsequential'. He said it is highly unlikely to dent his chances of victory in next month's election. "Some of you may think I will be affected, but it is not so. I will only miss his vote and nothing else. My support base remains intact," Oyongo said. The KNC leader said the defection came late in the day when the IEBC cannot remove Ndemo's name as Oyongo's running mate. "His details are already captured on the ballot as my bona fide running mate. His name will be there and if I win, he will choose to be sworn in with me or completely move out of my camp. He is still my running mate, at least on paper," Oyongo said. Edited by A.N
