A shooting incident between a multi-agency patrol team and two gunmen left one person dead. National Police Service (NPS) said in a statement on Saturday that they have launched a manhunt for the accomplice who escaped abandoning their motorbike. The shooting incident happened on Friday at the Kaberbok-Jillut area of Turkana South Sub-County. "Two armed gunmen on a motorbike are reported to have staged an attack against a multi-agency patrol team after defying an order to stop. This prompted immediate response and as a result, one of the suspects was fatally injured," Police said. An AK-47 rifle with 8 rounds of ammunition was recovered and was kept as an exhibit. The police service said the multi-agency security team in Turkana has heightened vigilance to ensure peace and security is maintained at all times. NPS added that they are constantly on the lookout for criminals who have in the past staged indiscriminate criminal attacks on innocent people. Elsewhere police have recovered a Mark IV riffle with an empty magazine in Marsabit. This is in the wake of the ongoing disarmament and peace efforts being sustained in Marsabit County where communities continue to voluntarily surrender illegal weapons. The operation is being undertaken by a multi-agency team of officers from the General Service Unit, Anti Stock Theft Unit and Rapid Deployment Unit.
