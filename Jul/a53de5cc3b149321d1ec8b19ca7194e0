Tottenham are closing in on Everton forward Richarlison, with agreement over a fee possible on Thursday. It is understood personal terms have been discussed with the 25-year-old, who wants to make the move. The Brazil international joined Everton from Watford for £50m in 2018 and has since scored 53 goals in 152 appearances for the Merseyside club. He finished top scorer at Everton last season as the club narrowly avoided relegation from the Premier League. Richarlison went into the campaign on the back of an exhausting summer, when he played for Brazil in both Copa America and the Olympic Games and scored 10 goals in the top flight. Six of those goals came in Everton's last nine games of the season as they finished 16th and four points above the relegation zone. Tottenham have qualified for this season's Champions League and have signed keeper Fraser Forster and midfielder Yves Bissouma  so far this summer.
