Bungoma woman representative Catherine Wambilianga's campaign team had a rough time seeking votes in Butunde, Namwela ward in Sirisia Constituency. This is after their campaign vehicles were stoned by a group of youths believed to have been hired. A woman is said to have been injured in the leg during the scuffle. Wambilianga made the allegations while running an empowerment program of issuing cheques to women groups in the Namwela ward. She condemned the chaotic incident saying every candidate has a right to campaign anywhere in the country. “This is unfortunate because Sirisia is part of Bungoma and I am allowed to come here and ask residents for votes. I condemn the organizers of such an act,” she said. “Today I am very saddened about this incident. My drivers were inside the cars during the barbaric act,” she noted. Wambilianga asked opponents to maintain peace during campaigns. “I know that we come from different political outfits but attacking me or my support won’t help. Let us just wait until election day. We practice our democratic right constitutionally, Kenya must be there after elections, youths please don’t be used by power-thirsty individuals to attack others,” she said. Wambilianga said that some of the boys who attacked her brigade are well-known asking the police to move with speed and apprehend the culprits behind the act. “From here I am going to the IEBC offices to report so that an action can be taken and trace those rowdy youths,” Wambilianga said.
