Presidential candidate George Wajackoya has promised to accommodate   Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) George Kinoti in his cabinet if he wins the August 9 polls. The Roots Party boss said he will replace Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i with Kinoti. Speaking during a campaign tour in Meru county on Friday, Wajackoyah said that Kinoti will help his administration in the fight against corruption and money laundering. “We want to deal with thieves of morale, the era of ‘wash wash’ and stealing public money and then you go telling people that you will be the next president. Kinoti is a man he has really tried to wrestle them though the issue has been politicised,” he said. While lauding the DCI boss for his dedication in his line of duty, he said  Kinoti has been unlawfully criticised by politicians. He similarly identified lawyer Muthomi Thiankolu from the same region to assume the position of Attorney General in his government. “Am going to appoint Muthomi Thiankolu if he accepts to be the new attorney general in August. When Muthomi is there as the attorney general and Kinoti as CS Interior won't I be able to do my job?” Wajackoyah posed. At the same time, the presidential hopeful told off Deputy President William Ruto, accusing him of downplaying his campaigns, following his recent remarks where he claimed his manifesto launch was a counter to his on June 30. “I want to tell DP Ruto and Raila Odinga, I'm not insulting them but we don’t have a monopoly in this country. I saw Ruto for the first time saying that I was ‘parachuted in’… don’t threaten me, continue threatening your other rivals, not me,” Wajackoyah added. Ruto had earlier on claimed that the Roots party leader is a government project whose manifesto launch was a ploy to divert attention from his own. "On that day of the manifesto launch, a fellow (Wajackoyah) was parachuted so that we share the screen, which again speaks to the same narrative of a biased media," Ruto said.
