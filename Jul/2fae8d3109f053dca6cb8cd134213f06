President Uhuru Kenyatta's tour of Naivasha on Tuesday could not end without a light moment. A chopper landing at a time when the President was delivering his speech ignited a light session as Uhuru was forced to halt his speech and react to the incident. The president had started reading his speech when the chopper-landing noise rented the air where he had pitched a tent to address residents. “This will come a long way…. Sasa hawa watu wanakuja saa zile nasoma hii kitu jameni!” He said as he looked outside. He paused his speech to allow the noise to disappear and it is then that he started a light conversation with the attendees. “This will go a long way by sorting water security…let us just wait for them. How is everyone? Are you all good? We are happy for your warm welcome to Naivasha…” he said as he bought time for the chopper to land. Uhuru, who seemed slightly agitated, said the pilots of the chopper were resting instead of doing the needful before he could start reading his speech. “We have been doing rounds here and they were just seated there waiting to land when I start my speech,” he said as he giggled. Earlier, Uhuru hit out at DP William Ruto over remarks about Mombasa port and the railway line to Naivasha. Ruto has for the umpteenth time blamed Uhuru and ODM leader Raila Odinga for the transfer of port services from Mombasa to Nairobi and Naivasha. Ruto said the transfer of port operations took place after the March 9, 2018 Handshake between Uhuru and Raila. But speaking in Naivasha on Tuesday, Uhuru said Ruto should stop lying to Kenyans in broad daylight. Uhuru also commissioned an additional unit at Olkaria 1 geothermal plant in Naivasha. The additional unit is set to raise the capacity of KenGen’s installed energy to 1904MW with its geothermal capacity standing at 799MW. He also commissioned the 172MW Olkaria V Geothermal Power project.
