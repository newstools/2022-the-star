Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has claimed that he is running more against President Uhuru Kenyatta, not ODM leader Raila Odinga. Ruto explained that his reasoning was triggered by the fact that Uhuru is the chairperson of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance. "From where I seat, I am running more against my boss than his candidate. And that is the real complication because the president is chairman of the party where my competitor is now running," he said. The Deputy President spoke during a meeting with pre-election assessors from the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI). He, however, acknowledged that in the last elections, the two were on the same side, before the 2018 handshake. The Azimio Coalition brings together Uhuru's Jubilee, Raila's ODM, Martha Karua's Narc Kenya and Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper among other parties. On Tuesday, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale claimed that if Azimio wins, the government will be controlled by Uhuru. Duale questioned Uhuru's interest in politics adding it will be unconstitutional for him to be actively involved in politics according to the Retirement Act. "The Retirement Act bars the President, deputy president, speakers, chief justice, deputy chief justice, and other state officers who get retirement benefits from participating in politics."
