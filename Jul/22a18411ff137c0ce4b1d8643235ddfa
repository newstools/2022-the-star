Deputy President William Ruto has come clean on the allegations that he almost slapped President Uhuru Kenyatta for almost quitting the battle for the presidency ahead of 2017 repeat polls. In an interview on Thursday, the DP explained that the remarks were made in jest. The DP clarified that he was trying to draw a picture for his audience on Friday, of how Uhuru was almost giving up. "Nobody can slap the president. Surely! Do you sincerely think you can slap the president? Honestly. That was a figure of speech," he said. Ruto said his actions were a testament that he cared much about Uhuru and their presidential bid. His action, he said, was to safeguard the hard struggle and spirited fight they had put to win the presidency adding he would not have allowed that to go to west. "I told him, my friend, you are not about to do anything silly like that. You know? That's what a genuine friend is all bout. When your friend is about to give up, you must be there to support, encourage and correct them," he added. On making the situation of the standoff public the DP said. "I did not want to embarrass the preside but that was the true situation." The remarks by the DP come after an audio recording emerged of him telling a group of elders from Kiambu how he fought for Uhuru's presidency even when he was on the verge of giving up.
