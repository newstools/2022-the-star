Table-topping Ulinzi welcome Inspired to the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) League at Nyayo National Stadium on Saturday. The soldiers, who are top with a maximum of 12 points from six games, are gunning for nothing short of a win against their opponents who have yet to play. In what is expected to be a tough weekend for them, Inspired play second-placed Strathmore University in their other assignment. "We are playing after a two-weekend break, which is good for recovery," said the students' coach Peter Mwathi. "Inspired is a good side and we have to give the match the seriousness it deserves. A win will be good for us." Other than Ulinzi and Strathmore, champions National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), who are third and fourth-placed Black Mamba will also be in action. In what is shaping up to be a fight for the ages, all the top four sides have yet to lose a game and they are well placed to continue their good run. NCPB have a date with Young City who are placed bottom of the seven-team table with no points having lost all their eight matches. The Technical University of Kenya, who are also winless in five outings, meet Buccaneers in what should be a close call. Kaloleni-based Black Mamba meet General Service Unit (GSU) who are fifth having lost one of their five matches, in a closely contested tie. On Sunday, the stubborn school boys -Makueni Bees travel to the city to take on struggling Young City. Inspired confront NCPB who are strong off the blocks as Black Mamba come face to face with Makueni Bees. The only women's fixture of the week will see New Hope face off against NCPB, who are third.
