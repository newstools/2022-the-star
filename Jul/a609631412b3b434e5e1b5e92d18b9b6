Maendeleo Chap Chap Machakos governor candidate Francis Maliti has shelved his bid and declared support for Wiper party candidate Wavinya Ndeti. Maliti is Governor Alfred Mutua's deputy and was seeking to succeed him in the August 9, polls. Mutua is the party leader of the Maendeleo Chap Chap. He dropped his bid for the seat, 13 days before the August 9th polls. Maliti on Tuesday declared his support for the Wiper party. By the time of going to the press, the two were holed up in a meeting at Wiper command centre. They are in a meeting convened by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and attended by other party officials including the secretary-general and Kathiani MP Robert Mbui. Maliti's move follows his running mate Rose Wambua's decision to ditch him on Sunday. Wambua publicly announced that she had ended her political marriage with the Machakos deputy governor whom she described as 'heading nowhere '.
