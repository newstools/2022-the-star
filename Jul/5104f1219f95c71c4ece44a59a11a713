Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has asked Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho to concentrate on selling Azimio candidate Raila Odinga and stop meddling in United Democratic Alliance (UDA) campaigns in Kirinyaga. Waiguru said she will not be threatened or intimidated by Kibicho. While responding to claims by Kibicho that she was being shielded by goons during her political campaign rallies, Waiguru said the PS had failed in her duties of protecting Kenyans and has no business lecturing Kenyans. Waiguru was speaking during a campaign rally at the Kithiriti area of Nyangati ward, The governor told off Kibicho saying his days as PS for the Interior ministry are numbered and should therefore be more concerned about his retirement. "Go tell Kibicho that the writing is on the wall. He has only a few days in office. I have heard him talk about goons. He should continue campaigning for Azimio," Waiguru said. The governor who is defending her seat on the UDA ticket further asked Azimio to prepare for a humiliating defeat saying Mt. Kenya was solidly behind William Ruto. She asked voters to support UDA because it's the only party with a clear manifesto on how to move Kenya forward.
