Deputy President William Ruto has accused Defence cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa of being ungrateful. Ruto who spoke in Trans Nzoia during his campaign tour argued that despite helping him land a cabinet position in the Jubilee government, the CS has since turned against him. The DP, who was responding to Wamalwa over his recent claim that he nearly slapped, took a swipe at him saying “In our community, we do not slap women, we respect them.” He said Wamalwa who has since ganged up with his opponents would now be jobless were it not for him. “Mwambie huyo mjamaa awache kuongea mingi, bila mimi angekuwa anatembea kwa barabara, mimi ndiye nilimtoa kwa mtaro na nikampatia kazi ya waziri. Serikali mimi ndiye niliunda na Uhuru Kenyatta huyo jamaa alikuwa anahangaika kwa barabara, unaongea kama nani? Bure kabisa,” said Ruto on Tuesday during his tour of Trans Nzoia county. Loosely translates to: "Tell that man to stop going wild, if it wasn’t for me he would be roaming the streets. I am the one who brought him and gave him the ministerial job because I formed Jubilee with President Kenyatta, otherwise he would be nowhere. Who is talking as?” The remarks by the DP come after CS Wamalwa accused him of almost slapping at a rally in Kakamega last Friday. "I want to tell you today, that even I Eugene Wamalwa your son, I almost got slapped by that guy. He told me to get out of his government and hand to me a resignation letter the following day,” he said. The CS said made the revelation arguing it has been a secret he has kept for a long. This came following the leaked audio that Ruto nearly smacked President Uhuru Kenyatta at the height of the 2017 disputed Presidential general election.
