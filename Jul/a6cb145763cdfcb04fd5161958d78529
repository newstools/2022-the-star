The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority has announced two airspace closures over Nairobi’s Wilson Airport, the country’s main hub for bush and beach flights. Wilson Airport airspace will be closed from 1000hrs to 1600hrs local time tomorrow, Thursday, July 28 and again on Friday 5th August 2022. The Star has established that the airspace was closed because of the trooping of colours by the millitary. Airlines operating scheduled services and charter flights from Wilson Airport, such as Safarilink, Air Kenya and others are making arrangements to either reschedule flights or else rebook passengers for departures on subsequent days. Some have requested passengers booked on those days to contact the respective reservation departments. "Due to temporary closure of Wilson Airport tomorrow- July 28, 2022- we expect to retime certain flights. Please contact our reservations team," an airline tweeted Wednesday evening.
