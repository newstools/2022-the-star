Actor Maina Olwenya will be laid to rest this coming weekend. The burial will be on Saturday at his grandfather’s home in Gacharaigu, Kangema, Murang’a county. Olwenya's family released a statement detailing moments that led to the famous creative's last moments. A post-mortem found he succumbed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thickened, complicating blood pumping. A vigil mass will be held tomorrow at the Kenya National Theatre . "We’ll have performances, tributes, stories and music, watch scenes from his notable works, and finally light candles under the tree, from 6pm to 9pm," organisers said. For anyone wishing to donate towards Olwenya's funeral arrangements, funds will still be channelled through the Mchanga account MAINA OLWENYA'S Final Journey | M-Changa https://www.mchanga.africa/fundraiser/56780.
