A gardener who was arrested after assaulting a policeman attached to the private residence of Deputy President William Ruto in Nairobi had arrived home late before picking a fight with officers at the gate. The gardener used a rungu to hit the policeman in the head leaving him with serious injuries. The officer and two others who were present said Nicholas Kibiwot Rono had on Thursday arrived past midnight and became rowdy at the entrance of the private residence. “He picked up a fight with the officers at the entrance before one asked to escort him to his residence a few meters away,” said an officer present. It was as Corporal Timothy Mugendi Rucha escorted Rono that the gardener picked a rungu he had and hit him on the head. The officer fell down unconscious before his colleagues rushed to his help. They then pinned down Rono and handcuffed him before calling for reinforcement. The DP was not present at the time of the incident on Thursday morning but some of his family members were sleeping then. The officer was taken to Nairobi West Hospital in critical condition with head injuries, police said. The incident happened early Thursday morning at around 12.20 am, police said. Senior police officers visited the scene after they received a report of the said assault. Those who visited the officer from Security Government Buildings said he was in a stable condition in hospital. Senior officials in the city refused to comment on the issue, saying it is under probe and the life of their colleague was at stake. Police hope to wait for the injured officer to recover and record his statement, and process his P3 form for the possible arraignment of the accused. They will also talk to the accused to hear his side of the story. The gardener has told police at the cells he was harassed at the entrance and felt humiliated. Dozens of officers guard the homes of the DP in the country.
