New signing Lynette Atieno has revealed that she joined Equity Bank Hawks with the sole purpose of helping them reclaim the league. Atieno has been instrumental in the Hawks' bright start to the season, guiding them to an impressive 3-0 start. "I joined Equity basically because I saw it as a step to bigger and better things in my basketball career," she said. "My focus is to win the women's Premier League title and make a podium finish in the African Club Championship." Atieno said she is excited about playing for the Hawks alongside teammates who are talented and understand the game. "I feel my skills are particularly well-suited to be part of this team considering I am a utility player." She added: "I am bringing to the table leadership, rebounding, outside shots inside presence, and post moves." "Atieno has played professionally with First Bank and Dolphins both of Nigeria,  Mount Fleuri (Seychelle) and Senegalese side, Dbaloc. Hawks' head coach David Maina said Atieno will play a key role in the team's push to dethrone Kenya Ports Authority. He said Atieno brings to the team valuable experience, considering she has played professional basketball outside the country. "She is a utility player that can be played as a shooting guard and as a small post depending on the game," noted Maina. He added: "Her presence in the team is instrumental and will help us reclaim the title." She posted 16 points in a 67-26 thrashing of Eagle Wings and also scored 10 points in another huge 71-32 thumping of Storms over the weekend.
