President Uhuru Kenyatta has commended Angolan President João Lourenço for his efforts in strengthening ties between Rwanda and DR Congo. Uhuru noted that president Lourenço has displayed exemplary leadership and commitment in his role as a mediator. Lourenço was appointed by the African Union (AU) to mediate the two countries. Uhuru was briefed on the recent mediation talks by the Angola Minister of External Relations of Téte António at State House on Saturday. The Angolan special envoy pointed out that the two countries had agreed on a proposal for an independent verification team that will ensure both sides adhere to the proposed roadmap for the peaceful resolution of the issues affecting them. Uhuru supported the progress and emphasized on the need for DR Congo and Rwanda to remain focused on the dialogue path to resolve their differences. “This is a positive move. Hopefully, we are heading in the right direction. We need to make sure we are constantly moving together, briefing each other on the steps we are making,” President Kenyatta said. He added that the Nairobi process, which he initiated, is now under the East African Community, a step that was taken during the EAC summit held in Arusha, Tanzania recently. Uhuru thanked the Angolan President for his efforts that were discussed in Lisbon on the sidelines of the second United Nations Ocean Conference. “I thank president Lourenço for what he has achieved on what we had agreed on in Lisbon. The most important thing is to establish that liaison office which will have representatives from both teams,” Uhuru said. Leaders present include the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo and Angolan Ambassador to Kenya Sianga Abilio among other senior government officials.
