Vihiga county has received a major boost on efforts to reclaim the degraded Maragoli Hills. A Catholic-based organisation identified as Mother Earth Network will partner with the county to help with the conservation programme. Through the partnership, 300,000 tree seedlings will be grown in a bid to reclaim a portion of the degraded area. Speaking in Vihiga in the governor's office, Mother Earth Network father Hermann Borg said the five-year programme is set to begin by September. He said the organisation aims at environmental conservation and management even as they consider involving learning institutions. On his part, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo applauded the partnership, saying the approach his administration has put in place is steadily reclaiming back the giant water tower. "We want to revive our forest and we can do it. I have done it as the governor and with this support we are going to do it better," Ottichilo said. He said his government will work under a memorandum of understanding with the organisation for a well structured manner that will realise a positive impact.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
