For some people, showering daily is part of a morning or evening routine that they have adopted as time goes by, while for others, taking a shower can be quite a hard task to do. Well, if you shower daily because you think you are supposed to, you might be relieved to know that showering daily might not be that good for you. Showering helps us maintain a normal, healthy skin which maintains the layer of oil and good bacteria, however, overdoing it with heavy sensitive products, scrubbing and using extremely hot water, leaves the skin dry and cracked. Showering a few times per week is enough for most people. "Though we might associate oily skin with dirty skin, the reality is that "healthy skin retains a layer of oil," so it's best not to wash it away more than necessary, it's good oil,” Dr. Robert H. Shmerling, MD, reported in the Harvard Health Publishing Blog. Besides considering it healthier, people may choose to shower daily for a number of reasons, including concerns about body odor, to help them wake up or they have a morning routine that may include working out. While there is no ideal frequency, experts suggest that showering several times per week is plenty for most people unless you are grimy, sweaty, or have other reasons to shower more often. Ideally, a three or four-minute shower with a focus on the armpits and groin is adequate. Though not visible, our bodies have built-in sanitation systems that help keep us clean, even when we're not scrubbing in warm water daily,” Niket Sonpal MD, a New York-based doctor said.
