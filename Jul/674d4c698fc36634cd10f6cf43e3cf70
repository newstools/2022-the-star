Lamu has opened its first-ever astro-turf pitch which was officially launched by Governor Fahim Twaha in Mkomani on Monday. The Twaif pitch is meant to improve accessibility to sporting facilities for hundreds of youths in Mkomani ward and across the county. The modern pitch is one of the seven sporting infrastructure projects undertaken by the county. The other six yet to be launched include the Shela astro-turf pitch which is at 90 per cent, Lamu primary (90 per cent) and the Muungano basketball court which is complete. Others include the Twaif basketball court (complete), the Witu football ground (complete) and the Tchundwa stadium dias (complete). Twaha said such facilities are in line with his manifesto and sports are a crucial part of his administration to promote gender equality, youth education, peace, cohesion, violence prevention, physical fitness and good health. “Through such facilities, we are able to not only harness sporting talent in this county but we are also able to keep our young people busy with sports and away from crime and other ills,” Twaha said. The governor said sporting infrastructure projects are a part of his sports promotion plan, which seeks to identify, cultivate, develop and support the discovery of indigenous sporting talents. The event was officiated by the county executive for Sports Paul Thairu alongside Mkomani MCA Yahya Shee. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
