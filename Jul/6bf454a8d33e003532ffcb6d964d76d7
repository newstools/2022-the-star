In a digital world, where privacy is highly appreciated. And while you may be interested in viewing your contact's status, you may not want everyone to know that you have been keeping an eye on what they are posting. WhatsApp lets you hide your view on status posts, however, you must be ready to sacrifice who viewed your status. To activate the setting simply: Step 1 Go into Settings on the Application. Step 2 Proceed to Account then Privacy option. Step 3 Untick Read receipts, and then from there, you are set. Nobody will know if you have read their status, although, again, you will also lose the ability to see who’s read your own. Tip and trick: If you switch off the read receipts, read status, and then switch them back on, other people will not know you have read their status, but you can see who is viewing.
