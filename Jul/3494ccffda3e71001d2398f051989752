Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua's trustworthiness and honest attributes earned her the running mate slot in Azimio. President Uhuru Kenyatta revealed this on Friday in a meeting with a group of religious leaders at State House, Nairobi. He said Karua can be trusted as she has always had the country's interests at heart. “Despite the fact that we have never been on good terms politically with Martha, she is a principled person. It is better I follow someone who is just, truthful and led by the desire to serve people but not self,” Uhuru said. The President said he was in awe of Karua's personality despite their past ideological differences. Uhuru cited Karua's unwavering stance regarding public service, noting that she is a reputable leader who has earned his respect. On June 1 during Madaraka day celebrations, Uhuru tactically endorsed Raila Odinga and as his preferred successor and Karua as the Azimio principle assistant. He said Kenyans have a historic opportunity to elect the first woman as Deputy President. “In August this year, if it is the wish of the electorate, we will have a chance of a woman shattering the glass ceiling by assuming the second-highest office in our republic,” the President said. Uhuru was speaking about his administration’s efforts in empowering and building women leadership in what could expose his role in the appointment of Karua as Azimio Coalition presidential running mate. On May 16, 2022, Raila nominated the former Justice minister as his running mate for the upcoming August 9 general election. (Edited by R Wanjala)
