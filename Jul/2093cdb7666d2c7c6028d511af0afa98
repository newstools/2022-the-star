Asienga Ebole of ODM and Ineah Makanga of DAP-K are going all out in their campaigns to unseat MP Omboko Milemba of ANC in Emuhaya constituency. Asienga was the main competitor of incumbent MP Milemba in the 2017 election. In 2017, Asienga contested for Emuhaya MP position on the Ford Kenya ticket. He later ditched the party and joined ODM. The ODM candidate has been criss-crossing the constituency to woo voters to his camp. “In any competition a good player must be ready to win or lose and in 2017 the majority spoke and I respected their decision. But this time round my friend Milemba should prepare for the tough race and I must unseat him,” Asienga said in a past event while in Emuhaya. The race seems to be a do or die between the Kenya Kwanza alliance and Azimio la Umoja candidates. Omboko is banking on his development record to secure votes for himself and Kenya Kwanza alliance. Cotu secretary Francis Atwoli, ODM deputy party leader Wycliffe Oparanya recently led other ODM delegations in Emuhaya to campaign for the ODM candidate. “We want to ensure ODM has enough foot soldiers in Parliament,” Oparanya said. Makanga told the Star he is ready to unseat Milemba. “I want to give genuine service delivery to my people, equal opportunities that I feel the incumbent have not done,” he said.​​
