Cracks have emerged in the Kenya Kwanza coalition in Bungoma after Bumula MP Mwambu Mabonga withdrew from joint coalition campaigns with their Ford Kenya counterparts. UDA candidates in Bumula constituency have decried neglect from the Ford Kenya team led by Senator Moses Wetang’ula and gubernatorial candidate Ken Lusaka. On Monday, the Kenya Kwanza team had organised a rally that was to traverse Bumula constituency. However, Mabonga withdrew from the caravan at the last minute. “I wish to inform all UDA candidates, independents and UDA supporters of my decision to withdraw from the Kenya Kwanza mashinani tour today ( Monday) in Bumula constituency,” he posted on his Facebook page. Mabonga said the decision came in the wake of deliberate moves by Ford Kenya to downgrade the tour to a one party affair. “I apologise to our supporters for this unprecedented move and advise them to keep off these rallies. I will advise on our future plans for the remainder of this campaign period,” he said Mabonga claims Ford Kenya is only campaigning for their Bumula MP candidate Augustine Luketelo and Ford Kenya MCA candidates unlike his campaigns for Wetang’ula and Lusaka. Ford Kenya is also campaigning for Bungoma Woman MP Catherine Wambilianga's reelection. UDA fielded MCA candidates in the all seven wards of Bumula constituency and they are all backing Mabonga’s reelection. All UDA candidates in the seven wards and independent candidates boycotted the Ford Kenya rallies pledging to work with Mabonga. Mabonga however said he is firmly behind Deputy President William Ruto’s State House bid but he won’t hold joint rallies with the affiliate Ford Kenya party. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
