Rangers captain Juma Alexander remains convinced his Bungoma-based Rangers will make the top six teams in the league this year. Juma said the self-supporting side will train hard before returning to Nairobi for their next set of fixtures. "Our target is to qualify for the Super Cup and we can only achieve that when we are placed among the top six teams," said an optimistic Juma He added: "By the time we come back here in late July or early August, we shall be fine and I can assure you we will post good results." He said the team doesn't always train together because of the player locations, but they will soon sort it out. "Our biggest challenge is traveling since we have all our games in Nairobi. We arrive early morning, play at nine and hang around waiting for our next match." "On Sunday, we have our last and third game in two days in the morning before departing back home. This is not easy." Juma said this is part of the main reason why the team is not able to post consistent results in the league. " This will, however, be a thing of the past," he noted. "We have not had it easy since we don't train more together because of our locations. But once we sort this, we will do better," he reiterated. Rangers men and women's teams posted mixed results in their first Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) matches at Nyayo Stadium last weekend. The two sides won two of their five matches on the card with the men beating Young City 34-22. Thry, however,  lost 36-34 to Makueni Bees and 28-22 to Strathmore University. The women on the other hand were hammered 48-22 by champions Nairobi Water Queens but redeemed themselves against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat), scalping the students  34-21.
