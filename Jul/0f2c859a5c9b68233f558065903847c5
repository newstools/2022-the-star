Former national champions Ulinzi Warriors' coach Bernard Mufutu believes his charges still have a lot of work to do if they are to regain past glory. Speaking after their hard fought 68-64 overtime win over Strathmore University Blades,  the tactician called for consistency among the soldiers. “We still have a lot of work to do but we are taking it a game at a time. Whether we win or lose, we are learning some lessons from each match,” said Mufutu. He went on to add, “From the matches played so far,  it is clear we need to work on our consistency.” He urged all his players to work as a team and deliver on the same level as he awaits the players who missed the epic weekend match to return for the next fixtures. The two giants were deadlocked 56-56 in a dramatic top-of-the-pick tie at the Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium before the soldiers dug deep to bag the maximum points. Ulinzi are top of the 12-team table with 11 points from six matches. They have only lost one match to Kenya Ports Authority (62-54).
