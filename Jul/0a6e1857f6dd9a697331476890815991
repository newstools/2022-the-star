National Police Service has put in place elaborate measures and strategies to ensure that security is guaranteed throughout the election period. Inspector General Hilary Mutyambai said that a total of 150,000 officers will be deployed during the elections to ensure a safe environment for all to cast their votes. The officers will include special police officers drawn from partner security agencies such as Kenya Prisons Service, NYS, KWS and Kenya Forest Service. Formed Police Units (FPUs) under the National Police Service have also been deployed across the country to offer tactical support to general duty officers before, during and after the general elections. "Further, there is a provision for a deployment of five Airset in strategic locations to provide logistical air support when and where required throughout the electioneering period," Mutyambai said. Mutyambai said the preparation has been ongoing since the last elections in 2017. "During this time, we took stock of our then performance, picked and learned form the best practices as we acknowledged our past challenges, and planned ahead to deliver a much safer and secure election," he affirmed. Mutyambai said in order to ensure proper coordination of all activities surrounding election security, he established the National Police Service Election Security Secretariat with express mandate to coordinate all activities on election preparedness. "Among the activities that the Secretariat has undertaken is development of election security manual, guidelines, and a training manual." The manuals were developed for use by police commanders to enhance election security strategy development and address previous gaps in police operations during elections. Mutyambai formalised the process of election security preparations in September 2021 in a conference attended by Regional Police Commanders, Formation Commanders and County Commanders.
