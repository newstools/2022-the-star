Masai Mara University is seeking to hire a Chief Internal Auditor months after the acting CIA resigned from the position. A notice from the varsity revealed that interested applicants should submit their applications to the chairman of the council by August 2. “Applications should reach chairmarauni@mmarau.ac.ke on or before 5 pm on the said date,” the notice reads. This vacancy announcement comes several months after Spencer Sankale, who was acting in that capacity, resigned. He resigned barely two months after assuming the position, the varsity said he cited personal reasons. He was the Chief Finance Officer at the university who exposed the graft in the institution in 2019 in an investigative exposé dubbed the 'Mara Heist' on Citizen TV. According to the university, Sankale was promoted from his substantive rank of Senior Accountant to Acting Chief Internal Auditor in June 2020 for his whistle-blowing role. “The elevation to the new position was to give Sankale unrestricted access to all information, including confidential information of the university so that he would directly report to the Council any anomalies for immediate corrective action.” Also, the varsity said that Sankale ignored several letters from the Council that had requested him to appear before it. He was asked to explain the claims that he had made in the media about corruption in the institution after resigning. The September 2019 exposé brought to light the systematic embezzlement by university officials. Other suspects who were caught up in the scandal included the school's Deputy VC of Finance and Planning Simon Kasine, Deputy VC of Academics John Almadi, Finance officer Anaclet Okumu and the VC's driver Noor Hassan Abdi. The exposé provoked a strong public reaction with varsity unions demanding the VC step aside for investigation.
