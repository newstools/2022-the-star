Azimio la Umoja Presidential running mate Martha Karua goes big on Tik Tok after she sews her own dress in the car while on the way to rallies. In the viral video which was captured on Monday, July  25 she is seen stitching the dress inside her car while heading to campaign rallies in Thika and Kajiado Counties. Karua was quick to note that she was taking precautions as the torn area was at risk of further splitting. "Something pulled the thread and it came off so I am trying to fix it, It is just a small area I need to hold together," she explained. Karua outlined that by sewing the dress it would help her save time since she had a packed day ahead. "I will be comfortable for the rest of the day and I do not have to change. I will be going to lots of places today including Thika, to meet with the Mau Mau," Karua said. The video, which has since gained popularity, got Kenyans talking and applauding the humbling experience, noting how it portrays a good example to our generation especially the young people encouraging them to earn basic skills in life. The video comes shortly after the sensational "Haroo ,Kutus  nimuranjigua video" which warmed the heart of many Kenyans. The incident happened after a comedian, by the name Joe took to social media and mimicked Martha Karua's style of campaigning for Azimio ahead of the August 9 elections. Joe who has since been famous uses the slang "Haroo" replacing the letters  "l with 'R"depicting the gichogo's pronunciation of words. The slang has since been used by Azimio candidates to sell its manifestos and agendas to the public. Karua later met the comedian and exchanged a few words with him, noting that the video would help her in approaching the youths and the younger generation.
