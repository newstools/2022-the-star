"I really wanted to win gold but I thank God for the silver. It has been a tough race and being alone made it even worse. However, I am grateful to have finished within the medal bracket," she said. Wangari was Kenya's sole representative in the race and she recounted how Australians intimidated her through their team work. "Australians had teamwork and they communicated throughout the race. I am not used to running alone. I would be comfortable if we were many," she said. Wangari said she will be hoping to improve her personal in future assignments. "I have achieved my personal best here and my next target She expressed gratitude to her family, friends and fans, adding her daughter had motivated her to run well and finish in the medal bracket. "I want to thank my family, friends and all the Kenyans for their support. My daughter has been rehearsing the national anthem with the hope that I will win. I am happy that I have made her proud. Before the race, she was telling me to run like Moraa and I'm sure I did," Wangari concluded.
