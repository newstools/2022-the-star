Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei is concerned with the low rate of transition of junior athletes into the senior category after excelling in age-grade competitions. Tuwei observed that very few athletes who took part at the 2017 World U18 and 2021 World U20 Championships, both held in Nairobi, are still in the limelight. Few, however, have remained crucial to the country's quest for global acclaim with 800m specialist Mary Moraa leading the line. She is among athletes expected to represent the country at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, both set for later this month. "Our aim is to nurture the young talents that we have identified. The youth are the future of this country in terms of athletics development and competition. My aspiration is to see all of you at the next World Championships (Budapest) and Olympics (Paris)," Tuwei said. "From our statistics (Athletics Kenya), many of the youth who participated in last year's WU20 and the 2017 WU18 Championships are nowhere to be seen. More than half of them have just disappeared. However, I want to congratulate the few who have graduated to the senior ranks." While speaking to Team Kenya to the World U20 Championships in Cali, Colombia, he added: "You have to remain disciplined and have a good program in training. Even as you sign contracts, consult us for guidance." He also credited the Youth Development Sub-Committee, led by Barnaba Korir for cutting down on age-cheating-related issues. "Back then, we used to deal with a lot of age-related issues. I want to congratulate Barnaba for eradicating that problem. I do not want us to be suspected or challenged because of something manageable," Tuwei said.
