Nominated MP David Sankok has termed the reports regarding his retirement from politics false. On Monday, he had claimed, in an interview with Spice FM, he was retiring from elective politics. But he has since clarified he will not contest in the 2022 elections, planning to make a comeback in future. Sankok ,who was on TV47, said the widely circulated statement  was not true. He added that he is too young to retire from active politics. "I did not say that I am retiring from politics, those are rumours. I said that I am not going for any elective seat just like my brother and friends Prof Kindiki, just like Sabina Chege. Just like John Mbadi the ODM chairman," he said. "Not going for an elective seat does not mean retiring from politics and if you see me very well, at the age of 43, yet we have people at the age of 80 still in politics, do I look like somebody who can exit politics?" Sankok added. The retirement reports had been attributed to a statement saying that he would not be seeking an elective position in the August election. “The issue of contesting is a personal decision. I decided this time round not to seek any elective position. I need to focus on my businesses," Sankok said. He attributes the birth of his political career to "Engaging in the advocacy of persons living with disability at a very early age." meaning he "never had time for personal development." In light of this Sankok's political career appears to be far from over.
