Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi has denied reports he is campaigning against Emuhaya MP Omboko Milemba (ANC). Osotsi while attending a church service in Emuhaya sub-county Nominated MP said he has no capacity to decide for Emuhaya people who they should elect as their MP. He said people should elect an MP who will deliver for them for the next five years after the August 9th general election. “We are all in the race to seek a mandate from our supporters to represent them in parliament, senate and at the county," he said. "Therefore voters must be knowledgeable enough to know who they are electing in terms of service delivery." The MP was reacting to sentiments that he has been on the frontline to ​de-campaign the area MP. He said those spreading such information are just propagandists who want to ruin his good relationship with the area MP. “Politics will come and go, we must sustain our brotherhood, neighbourhood and our friendship for the sake of our nation,” he said. Osotsi said he is seeking a senate seat to represent the Vihiga people. The lawmaker further urged locals to vote for Raila Odinga as the next president citing that Odinga has the capacity to deliver. “Odinga is the only best presidential candidate we have now to revive our economy that is ailing,” he cited. Osotsi further urged locals to sustain peace ahead of the August 9th election citing that peace is of more importance to Kenyans and Kenya at large. “We must ensure we have peace in our country. An election is a single-day event and we shouldn’t use it as an avenue to cause havoc,” the lawmaker said.
