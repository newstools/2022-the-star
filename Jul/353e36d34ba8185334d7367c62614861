Team Kenya registered mixed results as the Billie Jean King tournament started in Skopje, North Macedonia. Lawrence Karanja's charges lost 3-0 to Kosovo before earning a walkover over Namibia in Pool 'D'. Karanja will be hoping for a win in the final pool match against Albania on Thursday. "It will be a big match. We have to win to guarantee progress to the next round and the girls are fired up and relishing the challenge,” said Karanja. Cynthia Wanjala lost 6-1, 6-4 to Danika Bashota in the opening singles match while Adriana Lekaj thrashed Alicia Owe 6-0, 6-1 in the second. In the doubles category, Bashota and Lekaj made light work of  Owegi and Wanjala winning 6-1, 6-0. Kenya, who are ranked 106 at the week-long tournament, will be hoping to better the results from last year, where they finished second last in a 21-team outing in Lithuania. Karanja said the target remains to move up the rankings. “Our girls are determined to do the country proud and be in a good position come the end of the tournament,” said Karanja. Wanjala and Owegi played build-up matches in the ITF World Tennis tour last month at the Nairobi Club with Owegi winning the doubles category and getting to the semifinals of the singles tournament. Karanja had hoped to have Africa Junior champion Angela Okutoyi compete at the event but will have to make do with the rising star since she is still involved in the doubles category of the Wimbledon Junior Tournament. South Africa, North Macedonia, Botswana and Uganda are in Pool 'A' and in contention for promotion to Group two. The round-robin show will consist of two groups of four nations.  There will be an eight-team knock-out draw made up of the top teams from each group and the best two placed teams will proceed to the final. Only one team will be promoted.
