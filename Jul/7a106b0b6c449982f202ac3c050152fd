Kenya's national 3×3 women's team will embark on immediate training ahead of the World Championship in Romania in September, coach Tony Ochieng said. Speaking after guiding his charges to a 15-12 Nations League final series win over Uganda over the weekend, Ochieng said the event was good for the team. "We will start our training immediately, break for the general elections early next month and resume soon thereafter," said Ochieng. He went on: "The experience from the tournament was good for us. It exposed us to different teams with different playing styles which is a plus." Ochieng noted that the team that is also preparing for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, UK later this month can only get better. "We will have many local friendly games that will help us keep the players in shape before the two international events," he said. He said he identified the team's weaknesses and strengths during the tournament and will improve in every facet. "I am hoping to improve on ball movement and spacing, during training," Ochieng said. He added: "We must not take a lot of time on the ball and we need to learn to execute within the shortest time possible." The team had difficulties identifying a pool of players that will help the team during training. The all-conquering Kenya side consisted of captain Babra Achieng, Medina Okot, the event's top scorer, Jacqueline Kogo, Alexandria Andala and Lavender Atieno. Kenya qualified for the global show that is slated for September 12-16 after topping four other nations in the show held in Nairobi last week. Kenya, he said, will also take part in the Under 18 Africa Youth Games and Red Bulls championship to be held in Cairo, Egypt on Sept 12-16
