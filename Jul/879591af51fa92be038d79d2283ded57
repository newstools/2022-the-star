Rangers recorded their first Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league win after beating Young City 34-22 at Nyayo National Stadium on Sunday. The Bungoma-based side, who lost their two opening fixtures of the year the previous day, led 17-11 at the break. Mike Mabonga connected for six goals while Taalam Kelvin and Kiprono Alvas added five each. The losers had six from Danstene Shamalla. "Yesterday, we lost the two matches because of fatigue having travelled overnight and barely rested," noted coach Juma Gerald. "Today, we played better and reduced our mistakes. I believe the more matches we play, the better for us," he added. Rangers lost 36-34 to Makueni Bees in a closely fought tie. The Makueni side made it two wins with another 36-25 victory over Young City. "We were prepared.
