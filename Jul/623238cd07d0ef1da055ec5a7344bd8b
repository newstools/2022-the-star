The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has detailed how it plans to transmit poll results after the August 9 elections. The commission noted that the results will flow seamlessly from the polling station to the returning officers and will e broadcasted. On June 30, IEBC bowed to pressure and reverted its earlier plan to use the electronic voter register as the sole document for identifying voters. The commission, however, said it would only resort to the manual register as a last resort in case of a technology breakdown.
