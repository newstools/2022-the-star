Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has asked incumbent Kibra MP Imran Okoth to drop his bid to defend the seat in exchange for an appointment in the Azimio government. Speaking in Kibra on Sunday, the ODM leader asked Imran to drop out of the race in favour of Peter Orero Mwalimu. "Nataka muambie kijana yangu Imran mimi nitashika mkono yake awachane hapa sasa Mwalimu aingie," Raila told the crowd at a rally. (Tell my son Imran I will hold his hand, let him leave this for Mwalimu) Imran became the Kibra MP in November 2019 after he won the by election occasioned by the death of his brother, then MP Ken Okoth. But Raila prevailed upon him to abandon his quest to defend the seat for a state appointment in the Azimio la Umoja administration. Raila expressed optimism that he will win the August 9 polls. "Imran nitakuwa naye ndani ya serikali, awache Mwalimu aendelee hapa Kibra (I will be with Imran in government, let Mwalimu continue here in Kibra," Raila said. Imran and Orero tussled over the ODM ticket during party primaries in April and Orero carried the day. Orero garnered 3,422 votes against Imran's 2,739 votes. On May 20, 2022, Imran announced that he would defend his seat on an Independent ticket. Raila, however, said the two are all his allies and should not fight over the seat. "Hawa wote ni watu yangu, sitaki wapigane hapa namna hii. Nataka mmoja awe pande hii ingine mwingine aendelee pale kwa bunge," Raila said. He urged the electorate to adopt the six piece voting strategy to ensure all seats in Kibra go to ODM candidates.
