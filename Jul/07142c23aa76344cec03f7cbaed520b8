Weldon Langat and Titus Kipruto are now hoping to impress on the international scene after ruling the 15th edition of the Re-Discover Nandi 10km Road race over the weekend in Kapsabet, Nandi County. Langat, who emerged top in Nandi, said he was using the race as a precursor for the Prague 10km road race. He said: "Running and winning in the high altitude is not easy and this is a good sign for his assignment in Prague. “I came here with the sole purpose of winning the race and I am happy I did. This is good because this will help me prepare for Prague 10km Road race,” said Langat. Coming from Iten, Elgeyo Marakwet county, Langat clocked 30:01.81 minutes to beat Kipruto to second in 30:07.90. Amos Kiplagat completed the podium in 30:13.49. The race started at the Kapsanur along Kapsabet-Nandi Hills road and ended at Namgoi Primary School along Eldoret-Kapsabet road. “When I travel to the Czech Republic for the Prague 10km, I want to come home with the title. I have been training well for this race and I believe I can do it,” said Langat. Kipruto, who also trains in Iten, on the other hand, said his next stop will be the Copenhagen Half marathon in Denmark in September. Two-time New York City Marathon champion Geoffrey Kamworor set the world's half-marathon record on the same course in Prague. “I want to run my personal best when I line up at the Copenhagen. I have been training for the race and a win will propel me to another level,” said Kipruto. In the women's race, home girl Faith Cherono won the title in 34:20.80. Running in her maiden 10km race, she defeated Daisy Kimeli to second in 34:49.14 and Zenah Cheptoo completed the podium in 34:59.81. Like Langat and Kipruto, Cherono is optimistic of running in an international race in the near future. “For now I don’t have a race but my management has promised that I will be running soon in the USA,” said Cherono.
