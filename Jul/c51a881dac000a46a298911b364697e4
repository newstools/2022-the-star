The European Commission has urged countries across the bloc to cut their gas use by 15% until March amid fears Russia could halt supplies. It says the target is voluntary but will become legally binding if Moscow turns off the taps this summer. The key Nordstream 1 pipeline from Russia to Germany has been offline for maintenance for 10 days and is due to be turned back on this Thursday. But there are concerns Moscow will not follow through on its promise. Russia supplied Europe with 40% of its natural gas last year, with Germany the continent's largest importer in 2020, followed by Italy. But since Russia invaded Ukraine it has cut supplies to a number of smaller countries which have rejected its demand for payment for gas in roubles. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said a Europe-wide cut-off was a "likely scenario". "Russia is blackmailing us. Russia is using energy as a weapon," she said. "Therefore, in any event, whether it's a partial, major cut-off of Russian gas or a total cut-off of Russian gas, Europe needs to be ready." EU member states will vote on the Council's rationing plan at a meeting of energy ministers on 26 July.
