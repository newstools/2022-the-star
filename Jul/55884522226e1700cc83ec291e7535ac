One person has died and over four others are nursing serious injuries following a fatal road accident at Kombani junction in Kwale county. The accident involved a Toyota V8 Landcruiser and a Nissan Matatu. According to the area assistant chief Hamisi Mwavyoga, the Landcruiser was heading from Ukunda to Likoni while the matatu was waiting for passengers when the accident occurred. Mwavyoga said the Landcruiser driver was at a very high speed when he lost control and went head-on collision with the stationary matatu. "The Landcruiser was moving at over 200 speed and hit a road bump before knocking the matatu," he said. The Matatu driver lost both of his legs and four other passengers sustained severe injuries. They were unconscious when police rushed them to Kwale sub-county hospital. The Landcruiser had carried five passengers but had minor cuts. They were of Indian origin. Eye witnesses said the driver of the Landcruiser was speeding to catch up with his collegues who were also at a high speed. According to eyewitness Ali Juma, the front six vehicles managed to do away with the bump but the Landcruiser's driver had miscalculated forcing him to hold emergency breaks. "There were like seven different vehicles coming on a high speed, luckily the drivers of the first six saw the bump and slightly reduced speed but the Landcruiser failed," he said. Juma said due to the instant breaks the Landcruiser drifted high above the ground before hitting the matatu. The dead person was identified as a resident of Likoni, Mombasa county. Mwamvyoga advised motorists to avoid speeding. "Kindly drive while sober and observe traffic rules," he said. Two days ago, over 20 people died in a road accident along the Taru-Samburu highway in Kinango sub-county. County police commander Josphat Kinyua also warned motorists against violating traffic rules.
