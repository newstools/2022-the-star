Over 150 golfers have confirmed participation in the 12th leg of the Safaricom Golf Tour at the Kenya Airforce Golf Club in Nairobi this weekend. The tournament will see over 100 golfers take part in Saturday’s corporate event with 50 junior players participating in Sunday’s junior contest. There will also be a golf clinic that will introduce young aspiring golfers to the game. The tournament comes barely one week after a very successful tour that attracted over 400 junior and senior golfers— the highest turnout so far in the ongoing Tour. The event, which was won by 17-year-old Kelvin Kiplenge, included five junior golfers with a hearing impairment from Ngala School of the Deaf. With only three legs remaining before the Grand Finale on August 6 at  Vipingo, the tour has so far featured 6,000 golfers across various tournaments, junior clinics and outreach programmes. As part of growing the sport among junior players in the country, Safaricom has partnered with the Junior Golf Foundation to tap and nurture young talent. The juniors can register with the Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) for Sh1,000, which grants them access to play at any golf club in the country. “We are honoured to host our 12th leg of our ongoing Safaricom Golf Tour at the Kenya Airforce Golf Club as we prepare for the Grand Finale in Vipingo. We hope to witness some best talent as has been the case in the previous tournaments even as we continue to try and demystify the sport and make it accessible to all,” said Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa.
