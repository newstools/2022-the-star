Kakamega county commissioner John Ondego flagged off a 7km peace run for security officers and peace ambassadors. He said the peace run, called Election Bila Noma, is meant to sensitise members of the public on the importance of maintaining peace ahead of next month's polls. Security officers volunteered to participate in the run to advocate the importance of maintaining peace before, during and after elections. The county commissioner said peace is important for development to be achieved in the country. Ondego warned that the government will take action against those causing any form of disturbance. The administrator also advised those seeking different political seats to preach peace while warning youth against allowing themselves to be manipulated by politicians. Kakamega county police commander Joseph Kigen urged residents to notify the security team of any person intending to cause disturbance so action can be taken against them. He cautioned youth against drug abuse. On hate speech, Kigen said the security team has deployed gadgets to monitor hatemongers and arrest those inciting the public. Edited by A.N
