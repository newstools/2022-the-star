Google photo’s new update will allow users to go directly to screenshots by using a shortcut accessible from the photo app's icon on your homepage. According to Android police, all you have to do is touch and hold the app icon then lift your finger. If the app has shortcuts, you will get a list. Touch and hold the shortcut, then slide the shortcut to where you want to place it. Lift your finger. Screenshots received the in-app shortcut treatment as part of the Google Photos makeover in March. This will make it easier to find screenshots as users used to have to scroll through a bunch of images in order to find what they were looking for. In addition to the new shortcut, you can still manage your Android screenshots by going to your device folders and selecting the screenshot folder as before.
