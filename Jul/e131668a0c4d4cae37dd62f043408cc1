The Kisumu government has disbursed Sh609 million bursaries and scholarships to 110,079 beneficiaries in the last five years. Kisumu Deputy Governor Mathews Owili said they have been giving bursaries and scholarships every financial year since they took over the county leadership in 2017. “We have been able to change the lives of young learners, many of whom have since achieved their academic and career dreams,” he said. Owili spoke during the disbursement of Sh51.3 million in bursaries to more than 1,000 students. The beneficiaries are in secondary schools, colleges and universities. In the 2021-22 financial year, Owili said the county allocated Sh205 million, benefitting more than 30,000 students. “It is worth noting that the allocations for this kitty have been on an upward trajectory since 2017 compared to the preceding years,” he said. In 2018, Owili said, the bursary allocations per ward doubled from Sh2 million to Sh4.1 million. In the same year, the number of students on scholarship per ward was raised from eight to 10. The deputy governor said they established county and ward education bursary and scholarship committees to ensure transparency and accountability and reduce complaints. Owili said apart from scholarships, the number of students partially supported in secondary schools, colleges, driving schools, and universities has increased. He said in the 2021-22 financial year, the county government supported 70 marine students, 35 males and 35 females drawn from each of the 35 wards in the county. The county spent Sh60,000 on each one of them totalling Sh4.2 million. He said the last tranche of the 2021-22 financial year scholarship awards amounted to Sh51.3 million. He said they are focused on the expansion of vocational training, which is an important enabler in the economic growth of any nation. Owili said the number of vocational training centres in Kisumu has increased from 20 to 26 since 2018. “We expect the establishment of three more VTCs, one at Lela in Kobura, Waware in Masogo/Nyang’oma, and Path Othany in East Seme in the coming year,” he said. In addition, the county targets to establish at least one vocational centre per ward to bring the training closer to residents. The county, Owili said, spent approximately Sh206 million in capitation grants and was committed to increasing the allocation. “We urge the youth to enrol in VCT near them since the county guarantees partial payment of applicable fees of Sh15,000,” he added. On ECDEs, he pointed out that the county has increased ECD centres to 684, of the number 627 are anchored in primary schools and 57 are standalone public ECD centres. The public ECD centres have a total enrolment of 52,818 children–26,003 girls and 26,815 boys. Owili said they recently recruited 665 ECDE teachers across the seven subcounties on permanent and pensionable terms after having served on a contract basis. Edited by A.N
