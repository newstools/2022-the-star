Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has ordered schools not to send away students with fee arrears. He contends that the government has disbursed the second term capitation funds to primary and secondary schools. But the pronouncement is more often than not just lip service and does not reflect the reality on the ground. While all children have a right to education, schools on the other hand cannot continue to be saddled with huge amounts in debts. School heads have bills, workers to pay and maintenance to undertake. However,  the delay in the release of government funds often leaves them in a Catch-22. The heads say they are already operating on very tight budgets, more-so with increased enrolment and the 100 per cent transition drive by the government. This at a time when the prices of various commodities and services have gone up due to inflation. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government reduced school fees but capitation did not go up. Running a school is not about space and teachers, but requires many other auxiliary services and resources. Let parents pay fees, but head teachers need to handle needy students on a case by case basis.
