West Mugirango MP hopeful Stephen Mogaka has promised to allocate more bursaries to students in universities and colleges if elected. Mogaka said the education sector has not been taken care of by the current leadership. The city lawyer spoke in Nyamira town on Saturday when he met West Mugirango University and Colleges Students Association. “We are aware of the importance of education and there is every reason for us to give the sector a priority. Unfortunately, the leaders we elected are not interested in taking care of our educational needs,” Mogaka said. He urged residents to ensure they elect leaders who can prioritise the educational needs of the community and not those focused on personal interests. “This is not a favour that we are asking from the leaders, it is their role to ensure they help our children get the help they require to advance in education," he said. "But instead they decided to run away from the electorate and now they are back seeking our votes." Mogaka is eyeing the seat on a Jubilee ticket and says the electorate should feel the presence of leaders they elect. He questioned the manner in which the disbursement of bursaries for learners in the constituency is being done. Mogaka said there is no transparency in the entire process and cautioned residents against electing leaders who misuse funds meant for vulnerable learners. “The way bursaries have been disbursed is not pleasing at all. We need leaders who consider utilising government funds for the intended purpose for the betterment of our society,” Mogaka said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
