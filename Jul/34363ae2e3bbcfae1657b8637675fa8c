With the World Under-20 Championships just days away, Youth Development chairman Barnabas Korir is optimistic that Team Kenya will post exemplary results in Cali, Colombia. Korir said training for the juniors is running smoothly and believes all of them are in good shape and motivated to compete in Cali. He also believes a number of the youth benefitted immensely from the  Miramas camp for sprinters in April. The youngsters are set to depart on July 29 for the championships set to start on August 1 to 8. “The young team is supposed to leave on July 29 and I am inclined to say they are in good form at the moment. The Miramas camp was very beneficial to them because of the specialized training which yielded good results during the national trials as we selected a team for Colombia,” Korir said. He added: "Every championship is different but I have a feeling that the athletes are motivated and will do better than the previous editions." In the 2018 World Under-20 Championships edition in Tampere and the 2021 edition in Nairobi, Kenya topped the medal standings. Korir said unlike back in the day, the youngsters now have quality training equipment which gives them a higher chance of topping the medal tally again. He, however, warned that there is some work to be done on the sprints. Korir said the only challenge for the youngsters will be adapting to the weather in Colombia. “Right now, we have resources, not like back then. The only challenge we have is on the sprints and that is what we have been focusing on. The long-distance athletes are okay. I have talked to the team and told them to be free with us,” he said. The team comprises 28 athletes.
