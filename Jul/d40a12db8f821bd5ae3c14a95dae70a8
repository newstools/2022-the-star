Corn dog is a famous snack comprising of a sausage or hot dog on a stick. It is coated in a thick layer of cornmeal batter before being deep fried. It originated in the United States and is commonly found in American cuisine. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Using skewers or long chopsticks, thread the hot dogs in. Make sure to leave enough of the stick to keep ahold of while frying then set aside. Step 2 Using a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and pepper. Step 3 In another bowl, whisk together the milk and egg. Combine all the ingredients in one bowl to form a fairly thick batter. If it’s too thick, add in a little extra milk, a tablespoon at a time. Step 4 Heat cooking oil in a pan then transfer the batter in a long cup or jug. Step 5 Working with one hot dog at a time, dip the dog into the batter, twisting it to coat it fully. Lift the hot dog out and let any excess mixture drip off. Place the dipped hot dog into the hot oil and start to twirl the hot dog using the stick. Step 6 Ensure that the hot dog is completely covered in hot oil. Once the coating has started to brown, stop twisting the hot dog, but make sure it browns evenly on all sides. Step 7 Once the hot dog is golden brown, remove it from the oil and place on a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining hot dogs. Serve with your favourite beverage and salsa.
