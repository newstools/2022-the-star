Mt Elgon has bagged Sh80 million in Equalization Fund after a four-year spirited fight by Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. The funds will be shared between Kamugul, Kubura, Chepyuk, Sambocho and Koshok. Others are Sacho, Kapkurongo, Chongeywo and Mt Elgon Forest. In January 2018, Governor Wangamati took a team from Commission for Revenue Allocation (CRA) on a tour of Mt Elgon in a campaign to have the region considered for Equalization Fund. At every stop, Governor Wangamati, accompanied by area MP Fred Kapondi, made a case for Mt Elgon as a marginalized Subcounty. During the visit, he showed the team the best and worst of Mt Elgon and drew them to the dearth of social amenities in the region. "The region has the best soils in the region. It has the potential to feed the wider Western Kenya and yet due to its vastness, topography and soil type, its farms are cut off from the markets," he told the CRA delegation led by Chair Jane Kiringai and Vice-Chair Humphrey Watanga. Other Counties that have benefited from the Equalisation Fund are Turkana, Lamu, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta and Isiolo. The equalization fund is meant for the provision of basic services including water, roads, health facilities and electricity in the four counties considered marginalized. In an interview with the Star on Thursday, Bungoma County director of Communications Tim Machi said that the visit to Mt. Elgon was in 2019 but the funds were approved this month to support Mt. Elgon Constituency. Machi lauded governor Wycliffe Wangamati for his efforts of making sure that he supports Bungoma residents.
