A father, mother and their seven-year-old son died when a fire broke out in Ruaka, Kiambu on Tuesday afternoon. Firefighters were not able to reach the affected families due to the poor road network. The residents were able to contain the blaze themselves using their water. Sixteen other families were left homeless, after the fire destroyed their houses. Property of unknown value was destroyed in the inferno. Residents now want the county government to provide smaller fire engines, following rising cases of fires that led to the death of six people. They said the area is growing so fast and there is a need for the relevant departments to take responsibility and ensure that the strategies to handle emergencies, including fire, are put in place. In addition, they say that the introduction of smaller fire engines will make it easier to enter alleys where the current trucks cannot reach.
