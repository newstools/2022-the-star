Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has dispatched one of his cars and his team to Siaya in another effort to save former boxing star Conjestina Achieng from ill health. The former athlete will, however, not go to a rehabilitation centre this time but for prayers. Sonko has divulged that the family of the former star requested him to facilitate their bid to seek prayers. This is their apparent last resort to save their kin after rehabilitation attempts hit a snag. "Through her Son, the family believes she needs prayers and is proposing taking her to Pastor Ezekiel. They have been appealing for help but none of our leaders has heeded their cry," Sonko said. "Despite my busy court schedule and tribulations, I have decided to continue helping her including taking her to Mtumishi prophetess Mary Kagendo for prayers." This is one of the many efforts the former governor has made to restore the health and dignity of the boxing Star. In the past, Sonko took Conjestina to several rehabilitation centres including Nairobi County rehabilitation centres, Parklands,  and Diani Beach among others. He said the athlete has, however, reverted back to his old ways despite all efforts to save her from ill-health. "I have singlehandedly helped her before, taken her to various hospitals and rehabilitation centres where she gets full recovery and discharged than when she gets back to shags after a while gets worse again." The latest effort to save Conjestina comes after an image of the athlete in a sorry state emerged on social media. The athlete appeared sickly, weak; simply a pale shadow of his former self. Despite making Kenya proud in the boxing ring, Conjestina's life has remained a pity.
