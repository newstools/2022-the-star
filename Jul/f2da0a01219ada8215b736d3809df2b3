Gunmen have attacked a convoy of Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's team in Katsina, his home state in the north. Two persons sustained injuries in the advance convoy of security guards, protocol and media officers, according to a statement by the president's spokesman Garba Shehu. The convoy had gone ahead of the president’s trip to his Daura hometown to celebrate the Eid-ul-Adha Muslim festival this weekend when the attackers opened fire on them. They were however repelled by the military, the presidency said. Katsina is one of the states in north-west Nigeria affected by criminal activities of bandits. Many people have been killed and thousands kidnapped in the region since 2015.

Other armed criminal gangs have also carried out similar attacks. More than 5,000 inmates have escaped since 2020. Hours before the latest prison attack, gunmen opened fire on a presidential in the north of the country. President Muhammadu Buhari was not in any of the vehicles.
