Middle-distant coach Alex Sang wants Athletics Kenya to rethink the national team's preparations ahead of major events. Sang said the country can post much better results if preparations begin early. "Our main undoing is the last-minute rush but we need to rethink our strategy in the future," he added. “In the future, we need to organise the national trials as early as possible in order to tackle a number of issues including travel and doping. "This will help in visa application hiccups and backlogs hence focus better on training," he said. “This will also be good in avoiding late travels of athletes and expecting them to perform yet they are fatigued. The earlier we prepare the earlier we conquer,’’ he added. The 800m and 3000 steeple chase coach also condemned doping as he called on the government, through the Anti-doping Agency of Kenya (ADAK) to help curb the menace and educate the upcoming athletes on the same. “The problem with our athletes is that they want a shortcut to glory and this is wrong. We must find a way to protect the juniors against this menace otherwise we are doomed. It is not a good thing being in Category 'A' for all this time because it means being in the global focus all the time," he noted. He noted: " We appreciate what ADAK are doing but they need to take it to another level to ensure we revive our dwindling glory. It can't always be Kenya being painted in bad light whenever we travel abroad." The coach said despite the poor start, they still have high hopes of performing well in the ongoing World Championships in Oregon. “I expect good results from the 800m duo of Mary Mora (women) and (Emmanuel Korir). We have prepared them well and we expect them to deliver," he noted.
