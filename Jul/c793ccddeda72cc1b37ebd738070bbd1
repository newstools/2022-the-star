The race for the national sevens circuit intensifies this weekend with the Prinsloo Sevens at the Nakuru Athletic Club. The race has seen four different winners with KCB winning the opening leg at Kabeberi Sevens, Strathmore Leos bagging the Christie Sevens, Mwamba running away with the Driftwood title and Homeboyz gatecrashing the party at the Dala Sevens in Kisumu last weekend. The bankers open their campaign against Ngong road outfits, Quins and Impala before concluding their preliminary fixtures against a resurgent Nondies in Pool 'C'. The Thika Road side has recalled Kenya Simbas' Peter Kilonzo to their squad for the tournament as they hope to win a second tournament and boost their chances of winning the overall crown. Menengai Oilers will be hoping it's third time lucky after two final losses when they battle Kisumu, cross-town rivals and hosts Nakuru as well as Masinde Muliro of Science and Technology. Defending champions Mwamba will fancy their chances of navigating Pool 'D' when they take on Strathmore Leos, Blak Blad and newly-promoted Vihiga Granites. The black shirts won the last event played in the Rift Valley in 2019 by edging Homeboyz 14-7 in sudden death and coach Peter Kepha is hoping to go all the way. “Nakuru has been a good hunting ground for us in the past and if we can minimise  our errors and take our chances, then we can be in a strong position for the title,” said Kepha. Oscar Ayodi's Homeboyz will be the team to beat in Pool 'A' where they face Western Bulls, Kabras and Catholic Monks  in a tricky group. Ayodi, a former international, said they will take it one game at a time. "It's a wide-open group with very competitive teams. We can't underestimate any team," he said. The top two teams in each pool qualify for the quarterfinals while the teams placed third and fourth drop to the classification category.
