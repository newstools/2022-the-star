Former Bumula MP Bifwoli Wakoli has embarked on door-to-door campaigns to woo voters to elect him on August 9. Wakoli, an independent candidate, said his main aim in the door-to-door campaign is to explain his broad agenda to Bumula residents and quietly ask them to back his bid. He told the Star on Tuesday that his opponents do not have a clear agenda on what they want to do for Bumula people. “I have been in different positions of leadership both at constituency and national level and I have done much for Bumula,” Wakoli said. He said if elected, he will assist Mungore Boys School to buy land and build modern classrooms, saying students currently take lessons under a tree. “I don’t feel like Bumula NG-CDF is performing its mandate to the fullest as some schools, for instance Mungore Boys, learners are struggling to study under a tree,” Wakoli said. “If I win the race, I will heavily invest in the education of our children.” The former legislator also promised to establish a factory in Bumula to create jobs for the youth and improve residents' livelihoods. He said he will also set up a veterinary and agricultural college in the constituency. “These initiatives that I am pledging to start won’t only benefit Bumula people but also our neighbours,” Wakoli said. Others in the race to unseat incumbent MP Mwambu Mabonga of UDA are Jack Wamboka (DAP-K), Benjamin Osiula (independent) and Augustine Luketelo (Ford Kenya). Edited by A.N
