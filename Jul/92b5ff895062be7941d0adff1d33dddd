The National Police Service has subdivided the Athi River sub-county police division in Machakos County into two. Machakos County Police commander Issa Mohamud said the two are Athi River South and Athi River East. Both were generated from the former larger Athi River sub-county police division. “Athi River South covers Athi River, Joska and Kyumbi police station areas, while Athi River East sub-county covers Mavoko SNP, Mlolongo, Syokimau and Muungano police stations,” Mohamud told the Star on Saturday. Former Athi River sub-county police commander Anderson Njagi has taken over as the Athi River East sub-county police commander, while former Yatta sub-county police commander Nancy Njoki is in charge of Athi River South as the police boss. Issa said the changes were prompted by the fact that there was a need to effectively cover the entire area as National Police Service. There had been complaints from the public that Athi River sub-county was vast with lots of people settling in Katani, Syokimau areas hence the need for a well-equipped police station to serve the increasing population. “The changes are necessary for crime management and prevention and assist the communities in the area,” he said. Deputy Inspector General of Police Edward Mbugua presided over the official opening of Mavoko SNP Police station on Friday. This is the Athi River East sub-county's headquarters. And last week, Tatua police station in Meru County was opened by the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. Issa said the station was well equipped thereby offering a conducive working environment to police officers. “It also brings services closer to the people within Athi River East sub-county,” Mohamud said.
