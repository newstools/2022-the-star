Presidential Candidate Waihiga Mwaure now says he never lost in the last general elections claiming that he was rigged out. Mwaure who was then vying for the Lamu Senatorial seat stated that at the time, he lacked the facts that would have proved that he was rigged out. “In 2017 I believe I was rigged out. It's only that I couldn't get the facts. In that election, one of my competitors said that people were voted through the computer,” he noted. In 2017, Jubilee Party’s Anwar Loititip won the Senatorial seat to succeed Abu Chiaba in a race that attracted seven candidates. They included the then speaker of the county assembly Mohamed Hashim, nominated MCA Monica Njambi, politician Hassan Albeity, businessman Abdulrahman Aboud and ward administrator Ng’ang’a Kithuka. In the 2013 general elections, Mwaure had also attempted to vie for the Lamu Gubernatorial seat but didn't win. When asked why he is vying for the presidency despite losing in previous elections, Mwaure said it is because he never gives up. He referred to former the United States of America President Abraham Lincon whom he claimed tried 13 times before becoming the head of state. The late Lincon was an American lawyer who served as USA’s  16th president from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. “This is my sixth stab at being elected...The trouble we can be in Kenya is we give up when we go forward to August 9. But here I am because there is no room for giving up. Mwaure is among four candidates in the presidential race. Others are Azimio la Umoja Coalition flag bearer Raila Odinga, Kenya Kwanza’s William Ruto and  George Wajackoyah of the Roots Party.
