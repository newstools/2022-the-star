A man was on Friday arraigned in court for  using kicks and blows to beat up his wife who had just served him food and went to bed. No other strong reason was given to court on why he did so. In Court Joseph Kaniaru pleaded guilty  to the charges before Kibera Magistrate William Tulei. The charge sheet read in court says that he  committed the offence on July 4, 2022 at their rented house in Kangemi area, Nairobi. According to the prosecution, the  accused person  picked a quarrel with his wife,  Teresia Wangari, few minutes after she  handed him some food she prepared  for supper. The court heard that, the wife then went to bed to have a rest before the accused person  reportedly grabbed her  from the bed where she was sleeping and landed on her with  kicks  and blows injuring her left eye and lower jaw. The court heard that the accused person loosened her teeth on the lower jaw and she decided to  report the matter  to the police, who later arrested him. The accused person mitigated that he was a family man and asked the court for forgiveness.
