AFC Leopards assistant coach, Tom Juma, reckons the academy players promoted to the senior team last season have eventually come of age. Juma spoke a day after the 13-time Kenyan Premier League (KPL) champions overcame stiff competition to clinch the inaugural Elijah Lidonde Memorial Cup. The two-day pre-season tournament that concluded at the Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega county on Sunday, brought together four local sides including AFC Leopards, Kakamega Homeboyz, Nzoia Sugar and Vihiga Bullets. Leopards edged top-flight rivals Nzoia Sugar 8-7 on post-match penalties to lay claim to the trophy and the accompanying Sh1 million prize money. They survived a scare to beat National Super League side Vihiga Bullets 5-3 on their way to the finals. “We have quite a good number of young players who have matured with time right from the very day we absorbed them from the youth team. Soon they will be able to compete for titles, perhaps, even win the league next season,” Juma said. Juma extolled head coach Patrick Aussems for rolling out a comprehensive development plan, which he says has created a conduit for youth team players to blossom through the ranks. “If you examine our current crop of players, you'll realize that 90 per cent of them evolved from the youth team. We have agreed as a team to take that route going forward.” Juma believes Leopards can end their 20-year title drought next season. “I don’t think setting a target to win the league next season is farfetched. We have an effective plan in place to achieve that goal,” Juma said.
