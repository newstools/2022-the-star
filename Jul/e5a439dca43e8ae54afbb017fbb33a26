The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has moved to court seeking to recover public land grabbed by a former land commissioner. The land is estimated to be worth Sh77 million. The Anti-graft body moved to Nakuru Environment and Land Courts to have the land back, which the official is said to have helped private developers grab. “The land was reserved for Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation for research purposes in Naivasha, and is valued at Sh77,902,500,” EACC said. The said land is expansive and is geographically located along the Naivasha-Mai Mahiu Road a few kilometres from Naivasha Town. Upon investigations, the anti-graft established that the land was set aside for use as a veterinary in 1904. The Commission’s findings were confirmed by a Licensed Surveyor J. S. Vaughan, that the land belongs to KALRO. “He prepared survey plan FR 117/2 for LR. No. 12079 in 1970, the land is adjacent to LR. No. 12079 and it is indicated on the plan as Veterinary Department (Quarantine Farm),” EACC added. The land was un-surveyed at the time. The body said another survey on the Veterinary Department land was carried out in 1994 as per FR 270/13 prepared by Licensed Surveyor James Kamwere Muriuki. The survey shows four portions identified on the ground as; parcel number 230 measuring 87.47 hectares, parcel number 231 measuring 0.900 Ha, parcel number 232measuring 8.101 Ha, and parcel number 233 measuring 79.93 Ha and a service road. EACC pointed out that the survey work was instructed by the then Director for KARI (now KALRO) for their use. On January 17, 1996, another survey was carried out vide FR 298/133 by licensed surveyor, Gatome. The survey sub divided the parcels on FR 270/13 giving rise to the following parcels; 231 measuring 0.9 ha, 285 measuring 86.27 ha, 286 measuring 25.43 ha, 289 measuring 41.08 ha, 290 measuring 11.82 ha and 291 measuring 11.82 hectares. The investigations established that on April 16, 1995, parcel No. 230 measuring approximately 87.47 hectares was allocated to Pineapples Edge Limited. This is according to the records obtained from the Ministry of Lands. “On August 15,1995 parcel No. 230 and 233 measuring approximately 87.47 and 79.93 ha were allocated to Settlement Fund Trustees who accepted on December 21, 1995,” the Commission added. On 13, 1996 they were allocated as follows; Parcel No. 289 measuring approximately 41.08 ha was allocated to Settlement Fund Trustees while parcel No. 285 measuring approximately 86.27 ha was allocated to Settlement Fund Trustees. Further, parcel No. 286 measuring approximately 25.43 ha was allocated to Kenya Wildlife Service and it accepted the allocation. “Parcel No. 291 measuring approximately 11.82 ha was allocated to Settlement Fund Trustees and settlement Fund Trustees was allocated Uns. Naivasha Municipality measuring 23 ha.” EACC further established that on August 4, 1999, SPRO confirmed to the Director of Land Administration that parcel numbers 230 was 285, parcel no. 233 was 289 whereas parcel No. 231 measuring approximately 0.9 ha was not registered, and had no card. The parcels were part of Veterinary Department Land. Further, Naivasha Municipality Block V/286 measuring approximately 25.43 hectares was registered in the name of KWS as per Certificate of Official Search and Green Card. The land was registered on April 12, 1998. Investigations further established that parcel number Naivasha Municipality Block V/285  and Naivasha Municipality Block V/290 measuring approximately 86.27 ha and 11.82 ha respectively were registered in the name of Pineapples Edge Limited as per the Certificates of Official Search and Green Cards. Their registration was done on April 28, 1997 and May 8, 1997. Pineapples Edge Limited was struck off the Register of Companies and dissolved vide Kenya Gazette Notice No. 7395 of December 24, 1999. Further, parcel number Naivasha Municipality Block V/289 Naivasha Municipality Block V/291 measuring approximately 41.08 ha and 11.82 ha respectively were registered in the name of Trojan Nominees Limited.
