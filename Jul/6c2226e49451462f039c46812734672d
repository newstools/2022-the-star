Nairobi aims to collect Sh18.2 billion own source revenue in this financial year, 2022-23. This is part of the Sh38.3 billion proposed Nairobi City County Budget estimates. The new budget is a decrease from the last financial year, which is Sh39.63 billion, deemed the highest budget ever since devolution. A total of Sh11.35 billion will be allocated to development expenditure while Sh26.98 billion will go to recurrent expenditure. According to the county treasury, the 2022-23 projection of Sh38.3 billion budget will be funded by own source revenue of Sh18.2 billion and Sh17.3 billion from external sources. “The revenue targets have remained high, with a notable deficit being experienced since the start of county government,” reads the estimates. “This has translated into severe cash flow crunches and accumulation of pending bills over time.” The six key own-source revenue streams include parking fees, rates, single business permits, house rents, building permits and, billboards and adverts accounting to close to 80 per cent of the county’s annual own-source revenue. This year, City Hall has set a target for rates at Sh5.6 billion, single business permit Sh3 billion, parking fees Sh3 billion, building permits Sh1.8 billion, billboard and adverts Sh1.2 billion. Others include markets Sh538.8 million, fire services Sh450million, house rents Sh600 million,  food handlers certificates Sh250 million, liquor licenses Sh250 million, and other income Sh1.48 billion. Nairobi has been falling short of its revenue target since it came into existence in 2013 despite the digitisation of 136 of its revenue streams. This has been blamed on unreliable rates, low collection from single business permits and inefficient collection of parking fees. The highest amount ever collected was Sh11.71 billion in 2015-16 which was still short of the Sh15.3 billion target. The lowest was collected in  FY 2019-20 at  Sh8.5 billion which was half the targeted Sh17.31 billion. Rates were Sh1.89 billion against a target of Sh3.92 billion, single business permit Sh1.58 billion against Sh2.89 billion and parking fees Sh1.54 billion against Sh2.76 billion. Building permits Sh457 million was collected against Sh2.1 billion target, billboard and adverts Sh754 million against Sh1.42billion while markets Sh295 million was collected against Sh598 million. For fire services Sh218 million was collected against the Sh458 million target, house rents Sh495 million against Sh615 million, food handlers certificate Sh128 million against Sh300 million and liquor licenses Sh179 million against Sh289 million. Other incomes of Sh993 million were collected against the Sh1.78 billion target. The underperformance was largely attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, which resulted in reduced activities. Finance executive Allan Igambi said the second half of the financial year was largely characterised by reduced movement due to cessation and staff working from home. The Kenya Revenue Authority consistently improved revenue collection on a month-to-month basis. KRA was appointed the principal county revenue collector on March 16 last year as part of the agreement in the Deed of Transfer of functions of the county to the national government. The taxman was tasked with improving the county revenue collection.  Edited by Kiiluu Damaris
