IEBC Commissioner Francis Wanderi has defended the police over the arrest of three foreigners at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA). "The person who was coming from Venezuela was joining members of the team here so he came with those stickers," Wandera said. He was speaking during the media summit on elections at Sarova Panafric, Nairobi. "Stickers are not strategic election material. I commend the police officers because we are working together to ensure that anything that is coming to the country regarding election material must be correct," he said. "The police are doing their work and the commission is doing its work." On  Thursday, detectives from the DCI began investigations after the polls agency tags were intercepted from a passenger who had hidden them in his travelling bag. The passenger had 17 rolls of stickers for various constituencies in the country. The rolls were intercepted and the traveller detained for grilling. He was later taken to the DCI headquarters where he spent the better part of the day. In their probe, the police wanted to understand why the passenger was carrying the materials and who gave them to him. NPS spokesperson Bruno Shioso said investigations revealed that the stickers recovered are bone-fide property of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).
