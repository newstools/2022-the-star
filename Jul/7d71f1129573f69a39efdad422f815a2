Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria now claims that President Uhuru Kenyatta is threatening his life. The controversial MP in a protest statement against the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai claimed that his life is in danger, allegations the Star could not authenticate. Kuria faulted the police IG for providing excess security detail to UDA Kiambu governor candidate Kimani Wamatangi in all his political meetings. It is while making the statement that he claimed the President threatened him. "Dear IG Mutyambai, while your boss Uhuru Kenyatta is busy threatening my life, you are providing police in Uniforms in 3 land rovers under the command of an OCS to my competitor Kimani wa Matangi for all his meetings," he said in a statement on Facebook Saturday. "It happened on Wednesday in Mungere in Lari and yesterday in Ngegu, Kiambu Town. Not even Governor James Nyoro is getting this level of security. Treat us all equally and more so those of us whose lives are in danger after Uhuru Kenyatta's threats." He, however, did not reveal why he was being threatened by the president. The MP also did not provide any proof to substantiate claims that he was being threatened by the President. The Star was still pursuing information on whether the MP had reported the matter to the police by the time of going to the press. We endeavour to provide an update as soon as access the MP. Kuria is eyeing the Kiambu governor seat on the CCK party ticket that is supporting DP William Ruto for the presidency.
