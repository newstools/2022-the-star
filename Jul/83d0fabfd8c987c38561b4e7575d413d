If a poll by Mizani Africa on Kajiado woman rep candidates is anything to go by, Leah Sankaire is the woman to watch. With the clock clicking away, Sankaire of UDA is leading by 34.4 per cent, the poll indicates. It covered all Kajiado woan rep candidates. Sankaire, who hails from Loitokitok together with her governor candidate Katoo ole Metito, has links both in the south and the north of the county. While riding on the Metito's popularity, Sankaire is likely to bag all the votes her gubernatorial candidate will garner. She is ahead of seven other candidates, including Jenipher Moinkett (ODM) who came in at 21.5 per cent behind Sankaire. Moinkett was popular in January, March and early April until she moved to ODM with governor Joseph Lenku when her popularity started coming down. Like Sankaire, Moinkett has never held her rallies alone but depends on those organised by the UDA governor candidate. KAJIADO NORTH FACTOR Kajiado North constituency has 134,880 registered voters and each of the candidates seeking regional seats such as  senator, governor and women's rep is salivating at  the numbers. Two governor candidates, for the first time in recent elections, have picked running mates from the vote-rich north. Metito picked Judy Pere from Ongata Rongai town to be his running mate, while David Nkedianye of Jubilee Party settled on Kajiado North MP Joseph Manje as his running mate. Their decision has given Governor Joseph ole Lenku nightmares, considering that in 2017 he garnered more than 50 per cent of votes from the north. Any candidate vying for the women rep position and getting 70,000 votes from the north will likely turn the tables on other competitors. Moinkett hails from Kajiado North subcounty where Jubilee and UDA parties are gaining popularity over ODM after Governor Lenku had a spat with his MP candidate, George Yogo, and Kajiado North MP Joseph Manje (Jubilee). Yogo declared his support for the Jubilee governor  candidate, Nkedianye, to express his anger at Lenku. Yogo had called Lenku on the phone to complain to him that the the governorwas campaigning for his competitor from another party. Lenku also had a spat with Manje after former Governor Nkedianye picked the MP as his gubernatorial running mate. Others are Simayiai Rakita of the Jubilee party who received 10.4 per cent, Lucy Wachuka (8.5 per cent), Scholastica Mungai (6.5 per cent), and Gladys Sisina (Independent) had 1.2 per cent. Shariff Halima was placed last with 1.0 per cent. THE NUMBERS Kajiado North Constituency: Olkeri 31,549; Ongata Rongai 27,576; Nkaimurunya 33,207; Oloolua 19,810; Ngong 22,738.
