Nancy Jelegat and Emmanuel Bor are expected to defend their Re-Discover Nandi 10km road race titles on Sunday in Kapsabet, Nandi County. The duo, who won the women's and men's titles last year, are among top runners expected to battle for the titles in the race that enters its 15th year on Sunday. Race director and founder, Fred Kipanui, said they expect huge numbers  to take part in this year's race. This, he said was due to the increase increased in prize money as compared to last year. “We are expecting Jelagat and Bor to return here to defend their titles. The two have in the recent past dominated other road races across the world. In this race, we expect many elite athletes who always like using the  10km as part of their build-up for bigger races,” said Kiptanui. He added that the race provides opportunities for athletes who are yet to venture in international races. “The race is also being used to nurture the 10,000m and 5,000 runners because the numbers for long distance races has reduced," he added. The race is being sponsored by betting firm, Mozzart Bet. The company’s country manager Sasa Krneta said each of the participating athletes will also be provided with tree seedlings to plant as part of measures to mitigate climate change.
