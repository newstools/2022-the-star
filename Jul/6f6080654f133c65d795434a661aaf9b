Umoja coach Kevin Sunguti is eyeing his first win as they prepare to face Zetech University Titans in a Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) match at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasiuTitans m on Sunday. The self-supporting side who have lost all their three matches so far have vowed to give their battle this battle. "It's a slow start but I believe the losing streak stops this weekend. We are working on our game and so far it's not bad," offered Sunguti. He added: "Our progress was evident against the Equity game. We have a young great team and I believe in them." Umoja have lost against Strathmore University, Africa Nazarene University, and Equity Bank. Sunguti expects his new recruits Alphonce Omondi, Douglas Kivati, John Onyango and Kingsley Osula to perform. On Friday, in Eldoret, home boys Platinum Eldonet will welcome Kisumu Lakeside, and guard Renny Moibi said they are also sure of their first win. "The way we have been training under Tylor Okari (Morans' Guard), we are optimistic of beating them,"  said the speedy Moibi. Equity, who posted mixed results beating Umoja 54-52  and falling  64-61 to Thunder last weekend, will play Zetech University Titans. Eugene Genga's University of Nairobi 'Terrorists' will take on former champions Ulinzi Warriors in their opening fixture of the year. In the women's Premier League matches,  Eldonets will be at home to Kisumu Lady Bucks, who lost 66-34 to Zetech Sparks at home. Storms hope they can maintain their current form that saw them dismiss Western Delight 69-32 last week. On Sunday, former women champion Equity Bank Hawks confront Strathmore Swords who played well despite a 94-42 loss to Kenya Ports Authority. Equity Dumas and Terrorists will return to action for the second day in a row when they face off in what is expected to be a fierce battle.
