Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has criticised Senator Moses Wetang’ula’s bid to vie for the senator position saying that he should have run for Bungoma governor seat if he was serious. Oparanya asked the Bungoma electors to reject Wetang’ula saying he fights for his interests. “Wetang’ula has served in this position for two terms. Why is it that he can’t vie for a different seat?” Oparanya asked. “Next week I will pitch camp here to campaign for Wangamati to ensure that he outshines Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka.” He urged the residents to re-elect Wycliffe Wangamati saying electing a new governor will make Bungoma lag in development. Oparanya also criticised the late release of funds to counties on time saying county employees, contractors and suppliers haven’t been paid their dues. He spoke in Bungoma on Wednesday during the burial of Nicholas Wangamati, a brother to Bungoma governor Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa who was present said the funds' issue was solved and counties will receive their capitation to pay supplies and contractors. Oparanya joined Sabaot elders and Luhyas in Azimio in criticising Deputy President William Ruto for referring to Eugene as a woman during his campaigns. Some leaders from Eugene’s lineage now want Ruto to apologise. “We want peaceful elections and let every candidate be given time to sell their manifesto,” Eugen said. Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi differed with Wetang’ula’s sentiments when he said during the Kenya Kwanza rally that, scholarships should be scrapped and youths given money to purchase motorbikes.
