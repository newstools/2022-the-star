Construction of additional 112 classrooms to host junior secondary schools has started in various subcounties within Murang’a county. In the second phase, the classrooms will be distributed to benefit 68 secondary schools. Murang’a East subcounty director of education Samuel Ruitha said the additional construction of the Competency Based Curriculum classrooms comes after a successful completion of phase one of the project. “All 26 classrooms which were to be constructed in Murang’a East subcounty during phase one have been completed and handed over and the contractors paid,” Ruitha said. He was speaking during a meeting to monitor progress on construction of the classrooms on Wednesday. The director added that in phase two, the subcounty is to construct an additional three classrooms in only two secondary schools. The additional classrooms will be built at Mirira and Nyakihai secondary schools. Chairing the meeting on behalf of deputy county commissioner, assistant county commissioner David Kasyoka said the contractors have been given four weeks to complete the works. “Contractors awarded the jobs are requested to ensure the classrooms are completed and handed over within the stipulated period,” he said. Kasyoka further said from the experience of doing phase one, the challenges of building the classrooms are expected to be reduced. The government is committed to ensure the needed infrastructure is in place before the end of the year as junior secondary schools are expected to begin in 2023.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
