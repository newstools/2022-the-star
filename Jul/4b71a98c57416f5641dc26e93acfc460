Education CS George Magoha has committed to diligently serve President Uhuru Kenyatta until his term ends. Magoha, while breaking ground at Pumwani Boys, lauded the president for giving him ample environment to discharge his mandate. He said he has never regretted serving under President Uhuru since he was appointed cabinet secretary. "Like for this government, I will serve his excellency till death do us part, and death is in almost three weeks," Magoha said. The CS, whose term might end after August 9, polls, said it might be difficult for him to accept an appointment in future government if his irreducible minimums are not guaranteed. "If somebody wants my services they will have to convince me that they give me the leeway like the one am being given right now," Magoha said. Magoha said he has enjoyed working with his colleagues and staff at the education ministry for the time he has served. "I am serving the government of the Republic of Kenya, the government has respected me and I respect the government back," he said. He added that he has no qualms if told to vacate office after the August polls. "I also know that I was not born a minister and I will not die a minister, for me as Magoha," he said. Magoha was sworn in as the new Education Cabinet Secretary in June 2019.
