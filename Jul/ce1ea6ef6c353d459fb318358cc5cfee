Makuer Matur emerged the E-Sports champion during the Tusker Nexters tournament, which ended over the weekend. The event, which is a talent platform, saw Matur walk away with Sh500,000. Second-placed Leone Ndarwa received Sh350,000 while third and fourth-placed Luony Teat and Eric Ngige took home Sh150,000 and Sh100,000 respectively. The Nexters journey has been ongoing for the last 5 months having kicked off in March 2022 to mark Tusker’s 100th year of existence. Matur was ecstatic after bagging the win and said: “I always knew I had a chance. The people I was playing against are guys I have faced in many tournaments before this, so I had a plan. To see the plan work and to get the win; this is a really great moment.” “We have said repeatedly that Kenya has long been an incubator for some of the most exciting talents on this side of the continent. “Tusker has always held the hands of talented Kenyan artists and pioneers, and supported them to be the best versions of themselves and Nexters platform is no different. “These guys have the resilience to be able to withstand the journey, which has been long and hard for them, this far. I am really proud of all of them, and what we have been able to achieve thus far,”  Tusker senior brand manager, Catherine Twesigye said: The tournament started with auditions across the country before progressing into regional championships and culminating in the finals.
