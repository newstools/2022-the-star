Singer Stivo Simple Boy reveals how he spent huge payment he received from Odibets Stivo Simple Boy has for the first time disclosed how he spent the highest amount of money he has ever received for a performance. According to the singer, he used the amount to build a house for his parents. Stivo Simple Boy also revealed that the amount was half a million (Sh500,000) which he was paid by Odibets, after featuring in the betting company’s advertisement. "I was paid 500k by Odibets. I used that money to build a house for my parents," he stated. In October 2021, the man who came to be known for the phrase ‘Vijana tuwache mihadarati’ from the song "Mihadarati" was cast among the talents in the advert used to popularise their cash out feature. The advert sent social media users into frenzy with users showering the singer with praise for proving his critics wrong. Stivo Simple Boy had for months been trolled over his looks. The video he featured in starts with Simple Boy inside a Matatu as the conductor collects fare from other passengers, while engaging in a conversation with other passengers. All these time, Stivo Simple Boy is glued on his phone as he follows a football match with 'cash out' feature displayed on the screen and suddenly shouts, 'kateam kanamalizwa, shukisha’, before alighting from the vehicle. A few days ago, he disclosed that he missed a chance to work with Tanzanian sensation Harmonize on a song.
