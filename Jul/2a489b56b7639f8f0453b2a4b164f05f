The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission will decide next whether former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko will be on the ballot or not. Speaking to the Media on Saturday, IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said he is yet to take a look at the Supreme Court’s judgement that upheld Sonko's impeachment. "I have not had time to look at the judgement by the Supreme Court. As a team we shall discuss and look at the issues and make a decision next week,” he said. Last week on Wednesday, the commission cleared Sonko to run for Mombasa Governor’s seat in the August polls. It came after a three-judge bench overturned the court's earlier ruling and directed the commission to clear the flamboyant politician for the Mombasa governor race. However, on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld decisions by the High Court and Court of Appeal, affirming Sonko's impeachment. In the ruling, the apex court agreed with the decisions of the lower courts that Sonko was properly removed from office. The seven-judge bench led by Chief Justice Martha Koome cited seven reasons for their decision including that Chapter Six of the Constitution on Leadership and Integrity was not enacted for cosmetic purposes. "There were four counts of impeachable charges against the appellant. The County Assembly, the Senate and the two superior courts were convinced that the charges were proved to the standard required in such circumstances. No error for their analysis and conclusion has been presented," court ruled. Sonko nonetheless has remained optimistic saying he is and will be on the ballot for the Mombasa gubernatorial race arguing that the electorate have a right to elect the leaders they want. He faulted the CJ for being part of the bench that delivered the judgment Friday despite having announced her stand on the case. Sonko’s political future is now at the mercy of the IEBC.
