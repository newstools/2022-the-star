Former Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma has urged women in the county to help him recapture the seat to build further on the foundation he laid as pioneer county chief. Ranguma, who met more than 1,000 women drawn from Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, said he was not given ample time to fix the problems affecting the county. He said his first term was affected by a number of things, being the first time the country was rolling out devolution. “For the four and half years I was in office, I only worked for two years. I did my best to put structures in place that would spur growth up to the villages,” the former county chief said. Ranguma also urged other Kisumu residents to give him one more chance in the county leadership. He was accompanied by Kisumu Senator Fred Outa. Outa urged women to look critically at the leadership of Ranguma and that of current Governor Anyang Nyong’o. The senator said the re-entry of Ranguma would save the people of Kisumu from agony. He spoke to the women who converged at Dala Hera in Migosi ward. Outa said they have a team of agents who will ensure Ranguma's votes are protected at all cost. "Ranguma will defeat Nyong'o and this we are sure of, so come out in large numbers and vote on the election day," he said. Ranguma, who is contesting on the MDG party ticket, promised women that he will continue with his service to provide water, markets and funds for trade to women. The former governor and his team have campaigned across the seven subcounties. Edited by A.N
