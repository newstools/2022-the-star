Homeboyz RFC edged Menengai Oilers 19-14 in a topsy-turvy final to win the Dala Sevens at the Mamboleo Showground in Kisumu on Sunday. The Deejays became the fourth team to win a leg of the circuit after series leaders, KCB, Strathmore and Mwamba won the initial legs to blow the national circuit wide open with two tournaments remaining. Kenya Sevens youngster Amon Wamalwa touched down for the opening try as Mike Nyakundi slotted in the extras for a 7-0 lead. Oilers regrouped and levelled matters immediately with Amos Onyikwa going over the whitewash and Mike Kwemoi slotting home the conversion to tie the match at 7-7. Former Kenya Sevens international Leonard Mugaisi then powered his way to the try-line for a second try for Oscar Ayodi's charges for a 12-7 lead at the interval. On resumption, Collins Shikoli scored the decisive third try with Nyakundi converting for a 19-7 lead. Oilers battled hard and Simbas winger Beldad Ogeta crossed the line with Mark Kwemoi converting but it was too little, too late as Homeboyz held on for the victory. In the semis, Homeboyz edged Mwamba 14-10 as Oilers for the second successive tournament beat KCB 14-12. The bankers redeemed themselves by winning the bronze medal match after beating Mwamba 10-7. Strathmore took the fifth position after edging Nondies 17-12 as Kabras bagged the Challenge Trophy trouncing Nakuru 14-10.
