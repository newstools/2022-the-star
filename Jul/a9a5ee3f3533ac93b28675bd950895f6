A man in Kibera was charged at the Kibera law courts for defiling and impregnating his 17-year-old niece. PQ was charged before chief magistrate Ann Mwangi but denied the charges. According to the charge sheet, PQ defiled MA on July 12. Court documents show he committed the offence when his wife travelled for a burial in Siaya. His wife had entrusted her with taking care of their three children including the victim. Since they stayed in a one-bedroom house, two of them slept on the coaches in the sitting room while the youngest slept in their bedroom. On the said date, the accused is said to have tricked one of the children to follow him to his bedroom, leaving the niece in the sitting room. PQ later returned to the sitting room and defiled the girl. The accused person threatened her not to tell anyone. When the aunt came back, she never said a word but it was later discovered she was pregnant after narrating what had happened. The accused person urged the court to release him on a lenient bond term. The magistrate directed that he be released on Sh500,000 bond with a surety of the same amount. The matter will be mentioned early next month for a pre-trial.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
