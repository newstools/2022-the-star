Presidential Aspirant Reuben Kigame has suffered a major setback after the Court of Appeal suspended the decision that directed IEBC to consider his papers. This is after the IEBC appealed the High Court ruling arguing that the said order would have serious repercussions in the upcoming election which include postponing it if his name is to be included on the ballot. Justices Wanjiru Karanja, Francis Tuyiott and Hellen Omondi allowed the application by the electoral commission to stay the judgement pending the hearing of the case. “The appellant to serve the respondents, the respondent shall serve before Sunday. In the meantime, stay of execution of the High Court judgment,” the court ruled. Lawyer John Khaminwa, who was representing Kigame, had told the court that his client had been given an appointment by Chairman Wafula Chebukati at 11 am on Thursday so he wanted the court to wait for the outcome of the meeting. However, Lawyer Eric Gumbo for IEBC opposed the application, saying the proceedings are in relation to a judgment and there is no reason whatsoever they should wait for the outcome of the meeting. He accused Khaminwa of derailing the meeting. Khaminwa further claimed that he had not been served with the appeal documents but Gumbo said they had served the appeal to him. The electoral commission had appealed the High Court ruling that directed it to consider Kigame's papers to vie at the August 9 general election. Chebukati cited three legal impediments that he said hampers implementation of the court order. The case will be heard on Monday next week at noon.
