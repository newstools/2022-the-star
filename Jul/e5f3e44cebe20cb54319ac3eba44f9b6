Wildfires in southwest France and Spain force thousands to be evacuated as blistering heat put the region on alert. France has evacuated more than 14,000 people threatened by wildfires in the south-west, as fires also spread in Spain, Croatia and Greece. Portugal's fires are contained for now but Portuguese authorities say at least 238 people have died from the heat over the past week. Across the Mediterranean - from Morocco in the west to Crete in the east - thousands of firefighters and many waterbombing aircraft have been deployed.
