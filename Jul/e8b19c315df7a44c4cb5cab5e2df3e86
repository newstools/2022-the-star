Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has urged all the presidential candidates defeated in the coming election to concede defeat instead of rallying their supporters to protest. Sapit was speaking in Kajiado town on Thursday morning at the start of his 4-day pastoral to the region when he said Kenya cannot undergo any further turmoil. The Anglican archbishop said Kenyans have already decided who they will vote for as their president and those taking part in the election should accept the decision of the voters. “If you are defeated concede defeat and go home. If you are not satisfied with the results, go to court and argue your case,” archbishop Sapit urged the candidates. The outspoken archbishop said Kenyans have gone through many turmoils including the invasion of locusts, coronavirus, and now the high cost of living, and cannot take more trouble. “I am also urging Kenyans to go home after voting to wait for the results. This country cannot afford any more trouble. Let us preserve lives,” said Sapit. Sapit also warned politicians in counties that are cosmopolitan to stop threatening non-indigenous people, adding that all Kenyans have a right to coexist with others and live anywhere.
