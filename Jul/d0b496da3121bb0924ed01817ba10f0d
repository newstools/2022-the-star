Film director Abel Mutua says becoming a dad at the age of 23 years was challenging. Abel told Presenter Ali there was fear of raising a child, considering he was so young, but he is happy he managed. "I tell people is it's a double-edged sword to get a child at 23. If you are well prepared, mentally and financially, it's the best thing ever," he said. "This child, you grow up with them. By the time you get to 40 years maze, she is almost completing high school. Unajua huyo ni mtu mzima, you can sit down with this child and talk ideas." Abel has never regretted this decision, although it did come with its challenges. "I was not so badly off at that time and life was not as expensive as it is right now," he said. Abel is married to Judy Nyawira.
