Badminton player Sauma Gupta has set her sights on making it to the round of 16 as the Commonwealth Games get underway Friday in Birmingham. Gupta, who is making her debut in the competition, is relishing the challenge of playing the world's best players in the event. Gupta went through a tough qualification process to get at the Club Games and was delighted to qualify. “It's been a tough journey getting here but now that I am here,  I want to make it to the round of sixteen and do the country proud,” Gupta said. Gupta, who arrived in Birmingham four days ago, said she has been working on several aspects of her game ahead of the first-round match. "I have had a couple of days to train and work on my craft and it's an honour to play for the country at such a big event,” she noted. Commenting on the opponents,  Gupta said she will be watching the team event closely from today.  “When the team events start,  I will get to see my opponents properly,   identify their weaknesses and be in a good position to compete against them in the singles matches," she added. On his part, Samuel Sikoyo said he is focusing on his shuttle work and movement on the court. "We have had a couple of training sessions and so far, the facilities are good and I am working on my game in order to be ready for the first match," he noted. Sikoyo said they had a three-week training period before the Club Games. "We had a good session in Nairobi following the qualification,” he added. Team manager Mercy Mwethya, a former player herself, said the two players have nothing to be afraid of ahead of meeting the vastly experienced players in the competition. "This is sport and anything can happen. I have challenged them to do their best and be competitive,” she noted.
