Nyeri county is committed to empowering people through cooperatives to realise their socio-economic aspirations, Governor Mutahi Kahiga has said. Kahiga spoke when he joined co-operators from the county for the UN International Cooperative Alliance (Ushirika) Day celebrations outside his office. The day celebrates the role that cooperatives play for the social and economic growth within the society. Kahiga assured the cooperators of the county's support, noting that measures have been put in place to ensure the 193 active cooperative societies with a membership of more than 450,000 members have a continued prosperity. He urged the management of the cooperatives to remain faithful and efficient in their work. Kahiga assured them of his commitment to ensure that the annual capacity building programme for cooperative leaders that is fully facilitated by the county is always implemented to improve corporate governance. Those who attended this year's training were awarded certificated by Dedan Kimathi University of Technology where the best cooperators took home trophies and certificates. Since the programme was started in 2019, 1,800 leaders have been trained. The theme of this year is ‘Cooperatives Builds a Better World.’  (edited by Amol Awuor)
