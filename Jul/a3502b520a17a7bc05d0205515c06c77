Former Nyamira Senator Okong’o Mong’are has said he is ready to represent the county in the senate. Monga’re said the county government needs to be represented well for development to be achieved something he said has not been done for the last four years. He spoke in Nyamira town on Monday where he urged the residents to consider electing leaders who can ensure their resources are well monitored. “We have a lot of resources that have been misused since we do not have proper oversight of those who are in power on how the resources from the national government are being used,” Mong’are said. Those in the race include American-based businessman Alvin Machoka (UPIA party) Land engineer Adams Mochenwa (DP) and UDA’s Nyambega Mose will be on the ballot to battle to unseat Okong’o Omogeni. He said poor oversight of the county’s resources is among the factors that have contributed to underdevelopment in the county. He said there was a need to have leaders who can put the county executive and the assembly to task on how resources have been utilised. “We do not want our residents to suffer for the benefit of a few individuals who do not know their work, that is why our electorates need to be enlightened on why they should elect leaders who are sharp and can take care of their resources,” Mong’are said. “The role of any senator is to question the operations of the county which has not happened.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
