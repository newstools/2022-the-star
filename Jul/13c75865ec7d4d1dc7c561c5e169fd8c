Kenya National Congress party Kisii governor candidate Manson Oyongo has suspended his campaign for two days to mourn his three guards who died in an accident. The three succumbed to injuries at Ogembo Level 4 Hospital where they were rushed for treatment. Two others are fighting for their lives in hospital after the Probox car they were riding in lost control and rolled several times at Riobonyo area near Nyangusu. Police officers said the driver had attempted to avoid hitting a  boda boda rider when he lost control. Oyongo was in the convoy but his car was ahead. He was heading to a funeral in Magenche, Bomachoge Borabu when the accident occurred. Early, the KNC party boss had gone to console former Nyaribari Masaba MP Elijah Moindi who had lost his mother and was en route to another funeral in Magenche where area Ward Rep is bereaved. Two other guards who were in the car are admitted at the Kisii Teaching and Referral where they were transferred for specialised treatment. Party secretary general Ben Gisore sent condolences to the affected families on behalf of the party.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
