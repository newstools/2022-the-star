Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Sunday vowed not to rest until the Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga becomes the president of Kenya. The former Vice President acknowledged the Mt region support the Azimio has gotten since Raila named Narc leader Martha Karua as his running mate. He recounted when left the Coalition after he was not named as running mate saying that is now water under the bridge. "I went on a week's holiday to think and pray. I did that and said to myself, that I will be a fool to support Raila for 10 years then decamp just as he is about to achieve his bid. It was not possible," he said. "I could not let him take Kenyans to Canaan without me." He spoke during a campaign trail in the Magunga area, Homa Bay County. He lauded the Luo and Kamba communities for their undying support for the ODM leader since 2013. "I have decided that this round, I will not sleep until Raila becomes the next president," he said. He urged the people of Homa Bay to vote for Raila to achieve 15 million votes, adding that Raila has a good plan and is able to transform Kenya. "He has contributed much to the humanity of this nation," Kalonzo added. On June 2, Kalonzo rejoined Raila's camp and accepted to be the Chief Cabinet Secretary, if they win the office in the August 9 presidential polls. "I have since concluded and came to the realization that the future of Kenya is indeed squarely on our shoulders." "Beginning today, I will submit myself to the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance. The question is not if we form the government but when we form the next government," Kalonzo added.
