A man has been sentenced to 15 years behind bars for engaging in terror activities. Charles Kibet pleaded guilty to two charges before Kahawa chief magistrate Diana Mochache. The Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), in atweet, said the accused pleaded guilty to the collection of information to commit a terrorism act, contrary to Section 29 of the prevention of terrorism act. Kibet was also charged with being in possession of terrorism materials contrary to Section 30 of the prevention of terrorism act. “We retrieved large volumes of terror-related literature and extremist propaganda recordings from the accused during the arrest. He also confessed to planning to go for Jihad in either Somalia or the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),” DCI said. The accused was sentenced one month after his arrest by DCI’s Anti Terror detectives following an intelligence-led operation conducted in Kilgoris, Narok, on May 18. This comes months after police in Nairobi arrested a suspect who was found with more than 95 mobile phones, which they suspect he intended to use for terror-related activities. He claimed he was collecting the phones usually known as Kabambe to sell them at a later stage. Police say such gadgets are usually used to trigger bombs. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i said terrorism remains a threat in the country and urged the public to continue being vigilant. “Don’t drop the guard. The threat is real and out there. We have disrupted many terror plans through public cooperation but we urge continued help to tame this problem,” he said.
