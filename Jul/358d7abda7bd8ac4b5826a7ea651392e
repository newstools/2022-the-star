Lawyer Miguna Miguna has weighed in on the ongoing land row between the State and Kenyatta University. Miguna on Friday pointed out that the University is an independent, public institution and not an extension of the State House for them to demand their land. "Kenyatta University is an independent public institution. Not an appendage of State House or Kenyatta Family Estate. Just like the University of Maryland is not an extension of the White House," he tweeted. "The @WHO cannot forcefully take public land belonging to the University of Maryland because @JoeBiden and @WhiteHouse have illegally ordered Maryland University Council to cede the land. If you cannot legally do it in the US or Europe, you must not do it in Kenya or Africa." Miguna added that the rule of law should stop the World Health Organization (WHO) from getting the university land. "The WHO must be stopped from becoming an agent of land-grabbing in Kenya." The land row has been a subject of debate for the past week. This is after the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua, sent letters to VC Paul Wainaina, directing the university to surrender documents needed to hive off 410 acres by close of business on July 11. The VC denied the request, leading to his suspension. On Tuesday, while speaking to the University staff, Wainaina could not hold back his tears, as he bid them goodbye. He said he was one of the persons, that President Uhuru on July 9, said will go before his tenure expires. He explained that Kinyua's letter referred to the Cabinet meeting held on May 12, 2022. "The Cabinet approved the allocation of land to the Ministry of Health’s strategic institutions and the Kenyatta University Teaching Research and Referral Hospital,” the letter said. “We have the capacity to preserve, not to cede land. Our land is already planned and we showed them all the development plans some of which have stalled."
