The Tourism Fund has donated food and sanitary towels to learners at Tumutumu School for the Deaf. The donation and the school’s greening exercise is part of the organisation's corporate social responsibility. Food donated included maize flour, milk and soap, among others. The school, which admits learners with hearing impairment, mostly depends on well-wishers to run its activities. The fund also took part in a planting exercise where they planted tens of trees in the school grounds and Tumutumu Hill in Nyeri. Charles Okeyo, who is the director of levy services, encouraged the school fraternity to be passionate about environmental conservation by planting trees and nurturing them to maturity. Okeyo said it was a great opportunity to partner with the institution in tree planting in a bid to increase forest cover so as to attain the 10 per cent required in the country. “We chose the school because we want to nurture the pupils at a tender age on the need to conserve the environment,” he said. “School pupils are ambassadors of conservation even within their communities. Tourism Fund is also encouraging other schools to consider growing trees as part of their annual calendar of activities,” he said. “I challenge you all to ensure that all trees, like fruit trees and indigenous trees do survive to maturity.”  (edited by Amol Awuor)
