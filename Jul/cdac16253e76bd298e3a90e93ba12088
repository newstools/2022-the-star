Directorate of Criminal Investigations has intensified search for a 17-year old suspect who killed his cousin over charging a mobile phone. Josphat Kibet, 31, was pronounced dead on arrival at Kapsabet County Referral hospital, DCI director George Kinoti said. He said Kibet was stabbed with an arrow by the juvenile on Sunday night in Kaimosi, Nandi county. Detectives said preliminary investigations indicate that the two had argued over who would charge their phone first. "The suspect reached for an arrow and stabbed the deceased on the left side of his chest before fleeing," Kinoti said. This comes months after a man was arrested for allegedly killing his wife and secretly disposed off her body in Nandi. Nandi South police chief John Owuoth said the suspect, Naftali Avendi, 59, was put in custody after confirming that his girlfriend, 30, died and he buried her within his homestead. “His neighbours at Kamoron village suspected that something unusual could have happened after the woman went missing and on interrogation, the suspect admitted that she had died and buried privately,” Owuoth said. The police boss appealed to members of the public to be extra vigilant and ensure that their kin’s whereabouts are always known. “In this era of many cases of suicides and homicides, we must be vigilant," Owuoth said.
