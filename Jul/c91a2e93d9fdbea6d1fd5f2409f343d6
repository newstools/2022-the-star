Youth in Laikipia county have been urged to preach peace as the country gears towards August 9 general elections. Laikipia East deputy county commissioner Patrick Muli while  addressing Kazi Mtaani youth at Kirieri park in Nanyuki said youths are weak targets of rogue politicians due to lack of employment. “Be ambassadors of peace and don’t get misused to cause chaos, and respect one another especially during this electioneering period,” Muli said. The DCC called on youth to take advantage of government opportunities like youth funds and form groups to increase the chances of benefitting. “These are hard economic times. We know that you are not lazy, it is just that you lack opportunities. Therefore, when you are working in Kazi Mtaani, do it wholeheartedly and improve your economic sustainability,” Muli said. He added that the Kazi Mtaani programme is one of the government's ways of cushioning the youth against economic hardships. Muli further told the youth that Kazi Mtaani is an opportunity for them to market their talent and sharpen their skills aimed at being sustainable in future. The administrator warned the youth against wearing branded campaign materials while working in the Kazi Mtaani programme. During the meeting, youth were also sensitised on environment conservation. Kazi Mtaani is a government initiative to cushion vulnerable youth in informal settlements countrywide against economic hardship.
