Equity Bank Hawks thrashed Storms 71-32 in a Kenya Basketball Federation League (KNBL) match at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on Sunday. Lynette Atieno got the bankers off to a good start with a baseline jumper as they raced to a strong 40-17 halftime score. Bankers’ head coach David Maina is happy about the progress the former champions are making towards recovering their crown. “We are moving up well. Everybody is doing her part. This is work in progress and we will continue working hard,” said Maina. “Our defence is good and so is our attack. We will maintain that performance going forward.” Samba Mjomba led the bankers tally with 11 points while Lynette Akinyi, Hilda Ndegwa and Maryanne Nyagaki each grabbed 10. Storms coach Abel Nson, whose side has lost three of their four games, isn’t worried about the results just as yet. “We are fine. We are in a gelling process. We have lost games we expected to lose. We will come out of it,” he opined. Nyagaki was good for 22 points and Atieno added 16 as Equity Bank Hawks flew over Eagle Wings 68-26. The men’s tie saw Morans captain Griffin Ligare score 21 points but they fell 66-65 to Umoja, who posted their second win in a row.
