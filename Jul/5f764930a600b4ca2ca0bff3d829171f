Messaging platform, WhatsApp has announced that it is working on a feature that will allow users to keep disappearing messages. The firm said it plans to introduce a “Kept messages” section that will store all disappearing messages that the user wants to hold on to. “With this feature, it will be possible to keep a disappearing message in order to prevent its automatic deletion for all people in the conversation, but everyone can also un-keep the message for other people later,” they said. According to report by WhatsApp tracker WABetaInfo, currently, there is no way of storing messages in disappearing chats and users cannot even star messages in a disappearing chat. The Kept Messages feature will allow the user “Keep" a message, which will go to the “Kept Messages" section like archives or bookmarks. In addition, WhatsApp will let group admins limit this feature, which means there will be a new privacy setting that allows group admins to toggle the ability to keep a disappearing message. The feature is set to roll out soon globally but unfortunately, it is under development and will be released to beta testers, soon.
