Veteran Nairobi City Stars forward Ezekiel Odera is looking forward to another fruitful season after achieving the rare feat of winning the club’s golden boot for the third time. Odera went into the record books after becoming the club's top scorer on three occasions, surpassing four other players who had top-scored over two seasons. They are; Justus Basweti (2004/5 and 2006/7), Arthur Museve (2007/8 and 2008/9, Ugandan Dan Sserunkuma (2010/11 and 2011/12) and Gambian Ebrima Sanneh (2014/15 and 2019/20). Odera top-scored in the 2015/16 Premier League and 2016/17 National Super League seasons with four and 11 goals respectively. On Thursday, Odera said his target season is to better his performance while helping the team reach its targets. He hinted that he will retire at Simba wa Nairobi in the next two seasons. “I don’t see myself playing beyond two seasons,” said the 34-year-old. “Playing for Nairobi City Stars has always been a joy to me as a player. The working conditions at the club have been favorable to me. I am happy and blessed and always proud to wear a City Stars jersey.” He added: “As a striker, my job is to score goals and that has never been a problem. This explains why I have been the top scorer in three different seasons. It makes me proud.” “I am always thankful to my employers and I am hopeful that we will continue the good relationship and help them achieve their objectives as a club.” In hitting double digits in the 2021/22 season, Odera surpassed the eight goals that made Sanneh and Peter Opiyo Simba wa Nairobi's respective top scorers in the 2019/20 National Super League and 2020/21 FKF Premier League seasons. Unfortunately, Odera’s overall tally was reduced to nine after one of his goals, from the 3-0 win over Mathare United, was negated following the expulsion of the club from the league. He currently sits third behind Basweti and Francis Thairu in the all-time City Stars’ scoring record with 33 goals.
