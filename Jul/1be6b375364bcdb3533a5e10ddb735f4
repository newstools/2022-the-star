Manchester United are in advanced discussions with Ajax over defender Lisandro Martinez, and a deal could be concludedsoon. Talks to sign the Argentine, 24, have moved forward over the past few days. It is believed that Martinez, who has also been linked with Arsenal, is eager to make the switch. Martinez could become the club’s second signing under new manager Erik ten Hag, after the arrival of Tyrell Malacia on a four-year deal from Feyenoord. United are yet to confirm that Christian Eriksen has signed his contract. The center-back, who has made seven appearances for Argentina, joined Dutch side Ajax in 2019 and has played 120 times for the club. Meanwhile, Euro 2022 has broken the record for the total attendance at a European Women’s Championship - despite still being in the group stage. Euro 2017 in the Netherlands was attended by a total of 240,055 supporters, the record until now. But the 8,173 who watched France beat Belgium 2-1 in Rotherham took these Euros to a total of 248,075 fans. There are still 15 games remaining - including a likely record crowd for the Wembley final. England’s 1-0 win over Austria in the tournament opener was watched by a record 68,871 at Old Trafford, 27,570 clear of the previous landmark when Germany beat Norway in 2013 final in Solna, Sweden. The 28,847 who watched England beat Norway 8-0 in Brighton ranks fourth. There was also a record set for a group game not involving the hosts when 21,342 watched the Netherlands and Sweden draw 1-1 in Sheffield. The average crowd across the 16 games so far is 15,505.
