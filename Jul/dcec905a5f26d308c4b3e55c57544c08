The anti-corruption agency boss Twalib Mbarak recently announced that his team will recover salaries earned by public officials with fake academic papers. This is a welcome move and it is what Kenya needs most if corruption is to be uprooted. From taking and giving bribes to buying fake academic certificates to earning money fraudulently, Kenyans have mastered the art of corruption. Regime after regime has always promised to make the fight against the vice their top agenda. So far no government has done much. The fight has to start somewhere and Mbarak is moving in the right direction. But he needs the help of the Judiciary and Executive. Even before this initiative, Mbarak had recommended that those with fake papers not be allowed to run for public office but the electoral commission said its hands were tied The Judiciary has to play its role by handing out harsh jail terms and huge penalties to those found guilty of corruption to deter others. The Executive needs to provide a conducive environment for the anti-graft agency to work and give it all the support it requires. Only then can this vice be dealt with and future generations secured.
