Interior PS Karanja Kibicho now says they are privy to threats being pushed by a section of people to coerce people to support a particular faction. The PS, who took to his social media handle to weigh on the matter, asked leaders to focus on persuading voters to back them instead of issuing threats. He warned that those behind such threats will be brought to book even as he divulged that a multi-agency team has already been dispatched to handle the matter. "Elections are won through persuasion. NOT coercion or fearmongering. To our dismay, we're aware of leaflets warnings the electorate of dire consequences should they fail to vote for certain candidates on August 9," he tweeted on Sunday. "A multi-agency security team is pursuing the authors and distributors of the leaflets for a swift and deserved date with the justice system." Even though the PS did not divulge the exact areas affected, the Star has come to cross images of posters pinned on trees containing inciting images. Though the Star could not authenticate them, it is believed that it is on that backdrop that the government has intensified its long arm of the law to restore order. Social media images of the leaflets showed that one of the areas affected is Uasin Gishu county.
