Nairobi governor aspirant Johnson Sakaja has arrived for the Nairobi boss debate. He arrived 20 minutes past 8pm when the debate had started at Catholic University for Eastern Africa main campus in Karen. "My opponent likes an head start. Nilikuwa nataka kumpatia hiyo juu amezoea kupewa," Sakaja said, when asked why he was late. Loosely translated to, "My opponent likes an head start. I wanted to give it to him since he used to being given things." But in a quick rejoinder, Igathe said Sakaja was late because of the traffic within Nairobi. "I know he is late due to traffic. He shouldn't worry, I will sort out the traffic when I  become governor," he said. But Sakaja said said he came in to assure Kenyans that he is still in the race, after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission gazetted him on Sunday. He is currently facing a case regarding his academic credentials.
