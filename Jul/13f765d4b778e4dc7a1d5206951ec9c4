Kenyan fleet-footed forward Harrison Mwendwa has completed his move to Tanzania Premier League debutants Singinda Big Stars on a two-year deal. Mwendwa, 29, joins the Diamond Bank-sponsored side from Zambian Super League giants Kabwe Warriors. Singinda earned a promotion to the Tanzanian Premier League after topping the country's second-tier in the preceding season. The enterprising left-winger brought the development to light in a farewell message carried on his social media pages. "Dear Kabwe Warriors FC, I want to take this opportunity to thank the management, the technical bench, teammates, medics and all the fans for the support and encouragement,” Mwendwa wrote. “It was great working with you and I wish you luck in the coming season." Mwendwa joined Kabwe Warriors last year from traditional Kenyan Premier League giants AFC Leopards. Before his fruitful stint with the 13-time Kenyan champions, Mwendwa had previously featured for Mathare United and Kariobangi Sharks in the KPL.
