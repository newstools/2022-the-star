World 10,000m bronze medalist Margaret Chelimo is not resting on her laurels as she shifts her focus to the ongoing Diamond League series. After mixed fortunes in Oregon, Chelimo is already bracing up to compete in the Zurich Diamond League slated for September 7 and 8. Chelimo bagged bronze in the women’s 10,000m and placed fourth in the women’s 5,000m during the just concluded World Championships in Oregon. In an interview, Chelimo said she will focus more on her speedwork in a bid to improve her performance in her upcoming assignment. “I am happy to have doubled in the Oregon show, where I won bronze. My focus is now on the Diamond League. I have to work on my speed if I am to perform well. I am good in as far as my endurance is concerned,” she said. Chelimo also revealed that the women’s 5,000m race was not an easy one as the Ethiopians pushed them to the limit. Ethiopia's Gudaf Tsegay (14:46:29) and Dawit Seyaum (14:47.36) won gold and bronze respectively. African champion Beatrice Chebet bagged silver in 14:46.75. “The race was very tricky. The Ethiopians engaged us in endless mind games and It was all clear they wanted to shake us off. They were conversing throughout the race in a bid to confuse us. I congratulate Beatrice Chebet, who defied all odds to place second,” Chelimo said. Gloria Kite, who finished 10th in the race with a time of 15:01.22, also admitted that the women's 5,000m was not a walk in the park. “The race was not easy. This was my first time competing at the World Championships with the seniors and I believe I  tried. I have to go back on the drawing board as I await the next assignment,” Kite said.
