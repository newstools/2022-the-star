Outgoing Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has called on Kitui residents to back David Musila to succeed her in the August general election. Ngilu spoke in Kasevi village, Kivou in Mwingi central during the burial of Oliver Muinde who is Kitui senatorial aspirant Julius Muinde Mutukaa's son. The governor said she will use all she has to support Musila who lost to her in the 2017 election. "I cannot support someone who took the third position and that I had floored with over 100,000 votes, the one who was behind me is the one I will support, and that is David Musila," Ngilu said. The Narc party leader also urged Mwingi locals to support their own. "Time has come for Mwingi people to govern this county. Will you abandon your own? Well, that is up to you," she said. She also rubbished claims by Wiper party officials calling for six-piece voting. Ngilu expressed confidence that if Raila becomes president, he will appoint her to the cabinet not Hon Musila or ex-governor Malombe. "I decided to go to Nairobi to be throwing goodies to you from there. That's why I left Musila and governor Malombe to vie for the Kitui gubernatorial seat," she said Senator David Musila was the runners up after she defeated him and governor Julius Malombe in 2017. "I leave it to you to decide. I know very well that I am going to support Senator David Musila by all means." "I've spoken here in Mwingi. He's your man. I've finished what I wanted to say," she added.
