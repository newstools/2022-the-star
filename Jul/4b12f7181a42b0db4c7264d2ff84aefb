A case of three people charged with possessing 25kg of ivory worth Sh2.5 million will be heard on August 25. Kibera court senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto made the decision after the prosecution told the court to set a new hearing date. Nashon Wambua Mwema, an administrative officer, Charles Wambua, a retired police officer and Evans Moseti Mochere are accused of possessing five pieces of elephant tusks weighing on September 18, 2017. The three have denied the charges and are out on bond. The prosecution says that the three were arrested after Kenya Wildlife Service officers got a tip-off from members of the public. The officers swung into action and found the accused holding the five pieces of elephant tusks. They then arrested the three and recovered the ivory which had been wrapped in a white polythene bag and placed on the rear seat of a grey Nissan motor vehicle. The suspects were arraigned at a Kibera court where they were charged. The three suspects did not have permits to conduct the business. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
