Four suspects accused of stealing personal belongings from the bodies of the young people who died in mysterious circumstances at a tavern in East London, South Africa, have made an initial appearance in a Magistrate's Court. The male suspects, aged between 16 and 21, were arrested last week. None of them have yet entered a plea, as police are still investigating. The stolen items were recovered from their homes according to an official statement from the police. The four allegedly stole hair weaves, shoes, clothing and a watch in the wake of the deaths of the 21 youngsters. Cases of theft, possession of stolen property, and defeating the ends of justice have been opened against them for further investigation. Last month, the 21 young people from Scenery Park, a township outside East London, died in the Enyobeni tavern - the youngest was aged 13. A recent toxicology report was inconclusive, but initial findings show traces of methanol, which is a common ingredient in cleaning chemicals, were found in the bloodstream of all the victims. They were celebrating the end of the school term when, according to eye witnesses, the pupils started collapsing. The tavern owner and two employees appeared last week in court, charged with illegal alcohol sales to underaged people. The legal drinking age in South Africa is 18. This court case will start on 19 August.
