The family of the late South Gem ward candidate Nick Wanga now wants ODM to give the party ticket to his brother Paul Wanga. Through the family spokesman Abala Wanga, they want ODM not to carry out fresh primaries in the ward. Wanga died at Agha Khan Hospital in Kisumu on July 9, where he was undergoing treatment. Abala first unveiled his younger brother Paul Wanga to contest the seat once the IEBC sets a new date on July 22, during Nick's burial. "We present to the people of South Gem and ODM Paul Wanga to carry the mantle and pick up from Nick Wanga left," he said. Abala who is also Kisumu City manager asked MP Opiyo Wandayi who is the director of political affairs in ODM to communicate the decision to the party. The call by the family comes after the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission announced there will be no elections in South Gem ward in Siaya County on August 9. The ward is among four electoral areas where IEBC has suspended elections. The commission chairman Wafula Chebukati communicated the decision to suspend elections in those areas through a Kenya gazette notice dated July 25. The other areas where the August poll will not be conducted include Kyome Thaana ward in Mwingi West constituency, Oloimasani in Narok County and Utawala ward in Embakasi East constituency. The suspension was made following deaths of candidates. Other candidates who had been cleared for the South Gem ward seat have been carrying on with their campaigns oblivious of the new development.
