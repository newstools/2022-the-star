Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Wednesday reiterated that the Kenya Kwanza Alliance will give Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka a job if DP William Ruto wins the August 9 polls. Mutua said they will not leave Kalonzo behind even as he asked residents to back DP Ruto for the presidency. "Ruto will include Kalonzo Musyoka in his government as Ukambani shifts to Kenya Kwanza," he tweeted. The MCC leader did not however clarify in what capacity Kalonzo will be included. The Kenya Kwanza team took campaigns to Makueni County, where Mutua commended residents for welcoming them in large numbers. "The great people of Makueni at Sultan Hamud, Makindu and Masongoleni welcomed us as they came in large numbers to hear the good word of Kenya Kwanza and our leader William Ruto," Mutua said. On Tuesday, during campaigns in Kitui County, Ruto said he regretted how Kalonzo was being treated in Azimio, saying he will save him. "I know Kalonzo does not like me but it is not for any other reason, he has been incited by that man (Raila), why can’t you allow me to save this man?” Ruto asked. Ruto claimed that Raila Odinga was frustrating the Ukambani kingpin, adding that he denied him the running mate position. He further claimed that he realized Raila had become deceitful when he supported him for the presidency in 2007. “How can you deceive someone who has supported you twice an election?” he questioned.
