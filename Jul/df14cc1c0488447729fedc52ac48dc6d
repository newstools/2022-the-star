ODM nominee for the South Gem ward Nick Wanga will be buried on next Friday. Family spokesman Abala Wanga, who is the Kisumu city manager, said his younger brother will be buried at their family home at Kasagoma village, Ndori sub-location in Gem. “Burial preparations are ongoing, and major fundraising towards the ceremony will be held at our home on July 17,” he said. The politician died while receiving treatment at Agha Khan hospital on July 9. He succumbed to cerebral malaria. The late Wanga contested the seat in 2013 and 2017 but lost the ODM ticket. It is not clear yet whether the elections will be held in the ward following the death of the ODM nominee. The nominee passed on a month to the polls. On Monday, Siaya IEBC returning officer Catherine Bulinda told the Star that IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati will give directions on the matter. “The legal department is to communicate soon, they were waiting for the death certificate before giving direction,”  she said. ODM leaders from Siaya led by Senator James Orengo and his running mate William Oduol visited the family on Monday. Orengo described the late as a young leader who worked hard to see his people develop. “The party and the people of South Gem have lost a dedicated leader who had a bright future ahead of him. We pray for the family gets the strength to withstand this difficult period,” he said. The senator appealed to the people of Gem to turn out in large numbers to vote for the Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga. He told Azimio supporters to stop saying that Raila has won without turning out to cast their votes. “Raila needs all your votes and he can only win the election,” Orengo said. “Vote for me as well so that my government can get the opportunity to deliver on the development projects that Nick Wanga would have wished to see accomplished.”  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
