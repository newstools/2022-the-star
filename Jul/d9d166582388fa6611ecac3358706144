Protests have been held in major cities of Pakistan to denounce what has been described as “theft” of the mandate by the former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s party in the Punjab provincial assembly. Pakistan Tehreef-e-Insaaf (PTI), Imran khan’s party on Friday lost a very key vote in the Punjab assembly despite winning the by-elections there earlier in this week. Imran  was ousted from power after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership. The vote was held past midnight after opposition parties brought a motion against him, following days of drama. The motion was first brought last week, but the former cricket star blocked it by dissolving parliament. The vote took place after the country's Supreme Court ruled in favour of opposition parties and said that Khan had acted unconstitutionally. The vote was held to determine whether the province’s sitting chief minister – Hamza Sharbaz Sharif, the son of the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif – enjoyed the backing of the majority of legislators in the local parliament. The vote makes Khan the first Pakistani prime minister to be ousted by a no-confidence motion, with opposition parties securing 174 votes in the 342-member house in support of the no-confidence motion. Protesters however termed the vote as theft of Khan’s mandate. “They have stolen the mandate of Imran Khan. They have betrayed the nation. People won’t tolerate this. We have tolerated this for too long”, one protester was quoted as saying.
