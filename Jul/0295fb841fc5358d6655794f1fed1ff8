Youtube has announced that it will be rolling out Picture-in-Picture (PiP) to iPhone and iPad devices in the coming days. Picture in Picture allows you to watch YouTube videos in a small mini player while simultaneously browsing other apps on your mobile device. The feature has been available for Android users for some time now. It took a very long time for this feature to appear on iOS, but better late than never. How to use it: Simply select a YouTube video to watch and then leave the YouTube app (by swiping up from the bottom of your screen, or pressing the home button). The video will continue to play in a mini player, which you can move across your device’s screen as you use other apps.
