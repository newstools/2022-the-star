Crepes are paper-thin cakes that are almost similar to pancakes, the only difference is that crepes does not require a raising agent such as baking powder or baking soda. This means crepes are thin and flat while pancakes are thick and fluffy. Pancakes are often served in stacks and are an ideal go-to breakfast food. Crepes can be served with beef or chicken as wraps. They are generally served folded or rolled with various sweets or savoury fillings like strawberries, spinach, or bananas. Depending on the filling ingredients, crepes can be served as dessert or as a main dish. They are however larger in size and thinner compared to pancakes. Crepes and pancakes taste very similar they differ in terms of the size and preparation method. Ingredients Preparation Step 1: In a bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter/oil. Beat until a smooth medium consistency is achieved. Step 2: Over medium-high heat, warm a lightly oiled frying pan until hot. Pour or scoop the batter into the pan. Using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe, tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the paste coats the surface evenly.
