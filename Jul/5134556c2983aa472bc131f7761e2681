Nominated MP David Sankok has explained why he is not seeking an elective position in the August polls. According to Sankok, he needs time to focus on his businesses and that is why his name will not be on the ballot. "The issue of contesting or not contesting is a personal decision. I decided this time around not to seek any elective position, I need to do a bit of my business," he told Spice FM on Monday. He added that he began advocating for persons living with disability at a very young age, and did not have time to build himself. "Because I started engaging in the advocacy of persons living with disability at a very early age. So I never had time for personal development." Sankok, however, insisted that despite not seeking elective politics, he will continue to champion issues affecting people with disabilities, which are close to his heart. In the interview, the nominated MP also elaborated on the plan Kenya Kwanza Alliance has for PLWD in the country. He also defended his time in Parliament saying that he has actively participated in debates touching on national issues, as well as issues touching PLWDs. This, he said saw him get voted the best male parliamentarian and second overall for three years. "I am always on time because I don't want anything to go by without me bringing up the issue of persons with disabilities. I was recognised as the best performing male MP for three years," Sankok noted. He has previously said that being nominated to the National Assembly has hugely affected him financially.
