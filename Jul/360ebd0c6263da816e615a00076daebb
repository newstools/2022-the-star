Kenya's sprint star Ferdinand Omanyala has done us proud. He finished a honourable fifth in the semi-finals of a race in which a fraction of a second makes the difference between the winner and also-rans. His performance must be seen in light of the jet lag he had to overcome after an 18-hour journey after the bizarre US visa delay linked to the now familiar bureaucratic bungling in the Sports ministry. Omanyala landed only two and half hours to his heat. It's proof of his talent that he still made it to the semi-final. Our superstar deserves every bit of veneration. But a serious postmortem must be conducted about the logistical mess that almost denied Omanyala a great show. Heads must roll at the ministry to send a loud and clear message that such amateurish attitude to national duty can never be tolerated. The bureaucrats at the ministry will be aware that former minister Hassan Wario and official Stephen Soi were convicted of making a mess of the Rio Olympics of 2014. Soi is still serving time at Kamiti prison. An inquiry must be launched as soon as the team arrives from Oregon more so because the 2024 Olympic Games in France are around the horizon. Such incompetence must be punished and must never be tolerated in the management of public affairs.
