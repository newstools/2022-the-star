Kenyan singer Suzanna Owiyo on Friday revealed to the world a naughty side of her by narrating how she used to sneak into Five Star hotels to use their washrooms. Through her twitter handle, she said she couldn't explain how she developed the courage to enter the high end hotels. "When I arrived in Nairobi after completing my Secondary school education in Rae Girls, I was putting up at my elder sister's house in Dandora," she started. Suzanna said her choice of hotel highly depended on the street on which she would feel pressed to relieve herself. "When around GPO area, I would walk into Grand Regency, currently Laico Hotel. Along Parliament/City Hall, I would sneak into Intercontinental Hotel. When down on Moi Avenue, The Stanley /Hilton were my host," she said. According to Suzanna, security guards who usually man the hotels at the entrance accorded her warm reception on all her visits. "What I enjoyed most was the warm welcome I received from security at the entrance and during my exit." She said the habit went on for quite sometime without incident as none of the guards raised eyebrows about her covert habits. "I would walk in and pretend that I'm looking for someone at the lobby or restaurant area then easily get my way to the washroom, and relieve myself and come out like nothing happened," Suzanna said. The celebrated musician said that at that time, she was broke to such an extent that she couldn't even afford a soft drink or water, the most basic items on the menu at such hotels. "I had no cash to spend on soda, water or juice because I could not afford it, but the courage I had to go help myself in those washrooms is unmatched," Suzanna said.
