Actress Joy Furaha, well known for her role as Kawira on Papa Shirandula, says it's hard to know a celebrity's real behaviour. She spoke to Kikuyu Diaspora, addressing the issue of money in marriage. Kawira ended her marriage to Pastor Ephantus Wahome Safari on June 16, 2020. The two are well-known in the entertainment scene. Ephantus was Kawira's first love but she said they failed to connect. "You cannot know who you are dealing with in the entertainment industry. People can be pretenders and money is not everything," she said adding that she left to find her peace. "I left during a pandemic coz I was not at peace. While dating there was no red flag." Kawira regrets that she was too faithful and loyal to her man. "I did not provoke things and that is one way I failed. While dating, try to do something like coming late for a date to see their reaction and how they handle anger," she said. Kawira, a staunch Christian, also said she did not listen to God but was mesmerised by his dark and handsome looks. She spent six years in the marriage although she said she would have left early. "I regret that I would have left early so we could move on early. We would have moved to another chapter by now," she said. Kawira suffered a miscarriage and lost a child during her marriage. "I am a mother of twins but before that, I had lost my first pregnancy and then I had triplets and I lost one child," she said. "I am a mum to a boy and a girl. I would say maybe the assignment in that marriage was to just get my children." Her advice to anyone in a troubled marriage is not to wait if it is not working. "We called for delegation but still, it did not work. I am yet to find out why my marriage did not work coz I still don't understand. I don't understand why I had to go through that yet I was a church girl."
