Sports Kenya has written to the UDA party, saying that Nyayo National Stadium will not be available for their scheduled rally on August 6. According to the letter, there will be peace concerts that will take place in Nyayo Stadium from August 5. "We regret to inform you that due to peace concert scheduled to take place at both Moi International Sport Center- Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium between August 5 to 7 2022. The facility will not be available for their use," the letter said. The letter was copied to the Cabinet Secretary  Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage, the Principle Secretary State Department for Sports and Development and to the Chairman Sports Kenya Board Charles Waithaka. Sports Kenya said they highly regret the inconveniences caused. A storm had been brewing ahead of the August 9 polls following reports that the Azimio La Umoja coalition and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance had scheduled their last rallies at the same venue. Both camps were expected to hold their last major rallies on August 6. A statement by Azimio secretary general Junet Mohamed on Tuesday stated that the coalition will hold its major rally at Nyayo Stadium. "As the country approaches the general election in 20 days, the Azimio team wishes to thank all Kenyans of goodwill who have turned up in their millions all over the country at meetings, rallies and in person to join in this historic journey to a fair, just, prosperous and inclusive nation," the statement reads. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance had also stated that their last rally would be at the national Nyayo stadium. August 6 will be the last day of campaigns ahead of General Elections on August 9. Candidates are not allowed to campaign or hold rallies two days before the polls. Candidates, more often presidential ones, stage mega rallies to implore Kenyans to back them.
