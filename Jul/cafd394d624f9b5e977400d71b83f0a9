In an effort to empower and provide income to inmates, an organization has embarked on a tree planting drive across various correctional facilities across the country. Green World is an organization running rehabilitation and economic empowerment programs in prisons. According to the organization's secretary general Isaac Otieno, they are currently in the implementation stage of the project. The project started last month with the Homa Bay GK prison, and is currently, in the Kisumu Medium, Prison and from there, they will be heading to Kakamega. He said they are targeting at least 10 prisons in Western and Nyanza before December. The organization has visited around 20 prisons across the country. Otieno noted that once the tree is matured, it will be sold and the money gotten from the sales is directly given to the inmates. “The trees will take about three to five years to fully mature. During this period we will also be engaging the inmates in other economic empowerment activities like vegetables and poultry farming and after every four months they will have something in their pocket," he said. Speaking during the exercise in Kisumu at the Kibos Prisons, Otieno added that in each prison they will be visiting, they target to plant one million tree seedlings. Otieno noted that it was important to note that the money will come in handy for some of the inmates who acquired various skills while in prison and would want to practice them after being released. “We have prisoners who acquired various technical skills while serving their time, but lack capital to start a business when out there, so this initiative will provide them with such capital." The program is meant to enhance environmental conservation within the prisons at the same time increase forest cover.
