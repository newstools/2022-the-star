Roots party presidential candidate George Wajackoya on Tuesday almost slapped a security guard at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA). Wajackoya had arrived at CUEA for the scheduled presidential debate. In a video seen by the Star, Wajackoya hopped out of his car and tried to engage the guard. The drama started when the guard was seen directing Wajackoya's envoy into the university. The guard was trying to block Wajackoyah's car from entering the debate venue. Wajackoya was accompanied by his wife and was heard defending her. "So you want my wife to walk from here," Wajackoya said. The roots party leader has however maintained that he will not participate in the debate unless he battles with the other three candidates. Kenya kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto and his Agano party counterpart David Mwaure have confirmed they will attend the debate. However, Raila affirmed that he will not attend the debate. The debate will take place in two sessions.
