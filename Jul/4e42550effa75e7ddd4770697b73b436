Instagram down reports have been raised in Kenya and various parts of the world this week and over the past 24 hours. According to Down detector, they have received over 2600 reports which have been posted on the platform. Users took to Twitter to share the issues they are facing, most saying it takes a while to send and receive messages. For some, the application stopped every time they tried to update their Instagram stories. 92 percent of the cases reported the app is not working while 5 percent said the problem was on the website. Like with the previous Instagram outage, the latest issues users are experiencing this week have come after Instagram pushed out a new update. Users have been advised to update their applications for a smooth operation if the glitch persists. Instagram is yet to respond and comment on the issue on its official Twitter page.
