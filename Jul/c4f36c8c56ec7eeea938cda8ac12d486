Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi has warned that threats by the Azimio coalition to boycott elections would occassion voter apathy. While campaigning for the Kenya Kwanza ticket in Isinya, Kajiado County on Sunday, Mudavadi asked Kenyans not to be misled to boycott polls. “We’ve gotten to a point of no return and we can create voter apathy if not careful. We must not allow that kind of a debate amongst us,” he said. “If you boycott elections then you will start to say those in the leadership positions were not your choice.” His remarks follow recent utterances by the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential candidate Raila who said there will be no polls without the use of a manual register. “Manual register is a must at each and every polling station. It's not negotiable," he said. Raila, however, toned down on his stance, a day after, saying he is confident of winning the polls. He expressed commitment to taking part in the polls and asked the IEBC to be transparent. “We are not cowards to boycott the election. We will proceed with the election, but we are telling IEBC not to dare interfere with the election because we will not allow that to happen,” Raila said. IEBC has insisted that they shall use the electronic voter register. IEBC CEO Marjan Hussein explained that the physical manual register will only be used in cases where the KIEMS kit fails. “The presiding officer will only resort to using a printed register of voters after approval by the commission and upon, confirmation that the kits have failed and there is no possibility of repair or replacement,” he said.
