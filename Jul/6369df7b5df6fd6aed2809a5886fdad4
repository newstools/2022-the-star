Police are looking for a 29-year-old suspect who allegedly escaped from Homa Bay police station. The suspect was among two men who had been captured in Siaya having been accused of stealing in Nairobi. They were to be kept in the police station overnight before being transferred to Ndhiwa. Homa Bay Sub county Directorate of Criminal Investigation officer Monica Berege said one of the suspects ran away into the dark as officers were moving him from their vehicle to the cells. “The car was driven to a public parking place. The suspect escaped after they alighted from the police car heading to the cells,” Berege said. The incident occurred at 3am and the suspect is thought to have fled to Siaya. Berege argued that the officers were not familiar with the compound and that the darkness allowed the assailant to escape. It is not clear how the suspect ran away without police noticing. Berege called for residents to report any strangers in the surrounding areas stating, “We have circulated his details and our officers are looking for him”.
