The Orange party early Saturday lost its candidate for the South Gem ward. According to the family spokesman Abala Wanga, the late politician, Nick Wanga died on Saturday at around 6 am at the Agha Khan hospital in Kisumu. Abala who is the Kisumu City manager said his younger brother died while receiving treatment at the hospital where he was admitted three days ago. "It is a sad day for us as a family to lose a young man who had a bright future ahead of him," he said. The 40-year-old politician is said to have died due to cerebral malaria according to his brother. "He was fine. He was part of the team that met Jalang'o Midiwo at his home to discuss the way forward for the Gem constituency politics," he said. Last Sunday, the late Wanga met his campaign secretariat to lay strategies on how to clinch the South Gem ward seat. The family spokesman said burial preparations will be communicated later. "The body is lying at the Agha Khan Hospital as we begin meetings to plan for the burial," he said. He contested the seat in 2013 and 2017 but lost the ODM ticket. The party's officials at the national and county and constituency offices were not available for comment but it is expected that ODM will identify another candidate to run on its ticket following Wanga's death. Relatives and friends mourned him as a visionary leader who worked hard to see his people develop. Leaders from Gem who sent messages of condolences included Jalang'o Midiwo who said the people of South Gem had lost a dedicated and selfless leader.
