A teacher has been charged at a Kibera court with defiling a 14-year-old school-going girl contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. Sammy Kipkemoi Melly was charged before Kibera’s senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua where he denied the charges. The charge sheet says that the offence was committed on diverse dates between October 2021 and July 2022 at Nairobi aquariums in Lang’ata sub-county within Nairobi County. He was also charged with the second count of committing an indecent act with a minor contrary to the Sexual Offences Act. The detectives say the teacher committed the act after the girl went to his house to pick up some past papers. He denied the charges and, through his lawyer, pleaded with the court to release him on cash bail. The lawyer urged the court to grant his client a lenient bond term, saying that the accused person was not a flight risk. The magistrate released him on Sh300,000 bond and directed that the case be mentioned later this month for a pre-trial.
