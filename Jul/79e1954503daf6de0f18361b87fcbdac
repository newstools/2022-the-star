Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah has no plans for the country, United Green Movement Kabuchai MP candidate David Kibiti has said. He dismissed Wajackoyah’s plan to engage Kenyans in snake rearing and cultivation of bhang to improve the economy. “We can’t blindly vote for someone like Wajackoyah because he has no plan for our youth. What will happen to our youth if they are exposed to bhang and rearing of snakes?” Kibiti asked. He spoke to the Star in an interview on Tuesday. Kibiti said many youths in the country are educated and telling them that they should take part in snake rearing is a big joke that needs to be avoided at all costs. He however said that out of the four presidential candidates, none has a clear strategy in their manifesto to create employment for the youth. Kibiti is running for the Kabuchai parliamentary seat. He said if elected he will address the challenges facing youth and women in Kabuchai constituency. “Some of the work within the constituency should be given to the youth so that at the end of the day they can carry something home,” Kibiti said. “I think this is the right time for me to lead Kabuchai because I was born here and I understand the challenges that people face. If elected MP, I will ensure that the youth get something to do.” He said United Green Movement party is not allied to any coalition. He said the party is founded on the politics of democracy and green environment. On county politics, Kibiti urged Bungoma voters to elect a visionary governor who will take the area to the next level. Edited by A.N
