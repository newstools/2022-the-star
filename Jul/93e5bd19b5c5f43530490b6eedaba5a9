The High Court has declined to issue conservatory orders stopping the printing of ballot papers for Nairobi governor seat. Justice Anthony Mrima said the request for the order will affect other parties before they are accorded an opportunity to be heard. "Given that steps have already been taken for an expedited hearing for this matter, hence order shall not issue at this point," he said. He directed parties to appear in court on Monday for hearing. Dennis Wahome, a Nairobi voter, filed the case in court seeking orders to stop the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission from printing ballot papers for the Nairobi governor race pending a determination on the authenticity of Johnson Sakaja's degree certificate. Wahome says there are many glaring inconsistencies in Sakaja's claims that leave questions about the authenticity of his degree certificate. For instance, he says that Sakaja had in 2017, when seeking to run for Nairobi Senate seat, said he obtained his degree certificate from the University of Nairobi and now claims it is from Teams University in Uganda. Through lawyer Njoki Mboce, the petitioner argues that if the matter is not “determined forthwith, there is danger that IEBC shall proceed to include Sakaja's name on the ballot, a move that would be prejudicial for the petitioner”. Mboce says IEBC will not be able to deliver free, fair, credible, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent elections in the absence of a conclusive determination in the saga surrounding Sakaja's degree certificate. Wahome filed the case after the IEBC Dispute resolution committee dismissed Sakaja’s petition on June 19.
