A Kibera court was shocked on Friday after the prosecution said a woman who assaulted her neighbour had also said she was a prostitute who slept with dogs. Robai Wamoja had pleaded guilty to assaulting the woman and causing bodily harm when she smashed her face with a bucket. Her right eye was seriously injured. Wamoja appeared before Kibera magistrate William Tulei. The charge sheet read that she assaulted her on June 30 at Kangemi Gichagi area in Nairobi county The prosecution read aloud, "The accused person then said the complainant was a prostitute and at the same time told her she has slept with all the dogs within Kawangware." The court heard the complainant had gone to a tap right in front of the accused person’s house when the accused person insulted her. She took a bucket and hit the woman in the face. The woman  reported the attack to police. Wamoja was arrested and booked at Kangemi police station. She admitted she committed the offence but asked for forgiveness, saying she was a housewife from a humble background. She is a first-time offender. She was ordered to pay a fine of Sh20,000 or spend six months in jail. She was given 14 days to appeal. (Edited by V. Graham)
