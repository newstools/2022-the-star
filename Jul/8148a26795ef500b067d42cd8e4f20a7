Blazers' coach Geoffrey Omondi wants his charges to keep the momentum and rise to the occassion against Kenya Forest Service on Friday to keep their Kenya Volleyball Federation league playoffs hopes alive. Speaking after walloping Western Prisons 3-0 at Nyayo Stadium yesyerday, Omondi hinted on the need to silence their rivals and ensure  one foot is in top four with two matches remaining. "We had to adjust according to the opponent and that's why today's match wasn't tough. We take the three points but we have a  date with destiny on Friday. We have to be at our best, maintain focus and always be on the front foot in attack." He added: "A win will allow us to tackle the remaining fixtures with less pressure." Both Blazers and KFS are eyeing the remaining two slots with Kenya Ports Authority and the General Service Unit GSU assured of the top two places. His counterpart Japheth Mwok blamed the poor show on the myriad of challenges bedeviling the team. "We only trained twice before we traveled to Nairobi. We arrived on Thursday morning and players looked tired because of the long journey," Mwok explained. He continued: "Finishing is our biggest challenge. Backcourt defending and concentration lapses need to be worked on. We would have finished in a better position in the league but we gave 12 walkover points in the fifth leg. However, we hope to bounce back stronger next season." Trail Blazers led 11-6 at the first technical time out, and 22-17 at the second before bagging the opening set 25-20. Blazers made it 2-0 courtesy of a 25-21 second set win. Despite going toe-to-toe in the third set, Western Prisons conceded easy scores on service and reception to lose 25-20. Elsewhere, GSU slew Prisons Nairobi 3-0. Nyanza Prisons and Administration Police were awarded walkover points after their opponents' Central Prisons failed to show up.
