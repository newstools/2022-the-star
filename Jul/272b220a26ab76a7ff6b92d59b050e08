Deputy President William Ruto has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to go slow on his support for Raila Odinga and let him square it out with the Azimio presidential candidate man-to-man. In a near emotional plea, Ruto asked the President to step back in the spirit of their 2013 pre-election pact where Uhuru was to rule for ten years and let Ruto rule for another ten. "Sasa Uhuru Kenyatta ananisumbua ya nini? Mimi nilikuwa rafiki yake nimefanya ile alikuwa anataka, nakuomba my friend for old times sake wewe kaa kando wachia mimi kitendawili," Ruto said. This translates to, "Why is Uhuru Kenyatta disturbing me? I was his friend and I have done what he wanted. I ask you my friend for old times sake, step aside and let me deal with Mr Kitendawili." Ruto has taken to referring to Raila as Mr Kitendawili due to his usage of Swahili idioms and sayings to charm voters. The DP said he is ready to face off with the former prime minister on August 9 and expressed optimism that he will beat him hands down. He spoke on Saturday during a rally at Githurai in Nairobi. The DP had earlier on during a prayer meeting at Nyayo Stadium stated that he already felt victorious ahead of the polls. The prayer rally was organised by the Pentecostal and Evangelical Clergy of Kenya. “From where I stand, victory is already ours. Together with my running mate, we thank you for praying for us. We don't take it for granted that men of God from far and wide have come to pray over our candidature,” Ruto said.
