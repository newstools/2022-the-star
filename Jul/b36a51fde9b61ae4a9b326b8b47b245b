Commonwealth Games' 800m champion Wycliffe Kinyamal is keen to make amends during this year's edition after failing to live up to expectations at the just concluded World Championships in Oregon. Kinyamal clocked 1:47.07 to place in a poor eighth in a race that was won by Emmanuel Korir in 1:43.71. Algeria's Djamel Sedjati bagged silver in 1:44.14 as Canada’s Marco Stop settled for bronze in 1:44.28. Kinyamal explained that in as much as he was keen to end up on the podium, his body just shut down after the first lap. “I was in good shape during the heats and the semi-finals and things didn't seem to add up in the final. In fact, I am lucky to have finished the race," he noted. He said the world event is now water under the bridge and his focus now turns on this week's Commonwealth Games, where he hopes to defend his title. Meanwhile, World Under-20 800m champion Emmanuel Wanyonyi was over the moon after placing the fourth position in the two-lap race in 1:44.54. “I am very happy to have gotten to the finals and finished fourth. This is my first time competing with the seniors at the World Championships and I am content with my results. I am also happy for Korir because of his achievement,” an elated Wanyonyi said. Wanyonyi cited lack of experience as his main undoing but promised to work on his weaknesses as he seeks to make the podium in Birmingham. “Inexperience was my main problem but I hope to use my lessons in Oregon to deliver in Birmingham. I am on the right track and when my time comes to shine, I will not struggle," he added. Kinyamal will be joined by  Wanyonyi and Elias Ngeny at Birmingham.
