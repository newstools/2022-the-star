His appointment comes after Adholla was fired following disagreements over the title deeds of Kenyatta University land. President Uhuru Kenyatta had issues with university management for not releasing part of the land to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in order to build an emergency hub that would cater to its regional operation. This also led to the ousting of Kenyatta University Vice Chancellor Paul Wainaina. In his final address, he stated that he was being removed from office following his refusal to comply with government advice to surrender the land to WHO. Wainaina's firing angered students who condemned the act and threatened to boycott learning.
