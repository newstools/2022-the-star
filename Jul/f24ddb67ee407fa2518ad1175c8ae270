ANC candidate for Shinyalu MP seat Fred Ikana has urged his supporters to maintain peace before and after the polls. Ikana said Kenya is bigger than any individual and every citizen has a right to exercise his or her constitutional right of choosing their leaders peacefully. He said Kenyans should desist from hate speech and acts of violence that might throw the country into chaos. "I urge all Shinyalu people and Kenyans at large to remain peaceful during campaigns and even after the polls. Elections come and go but we will remain and live together as always," Ikana said. He spoke in Shibuye and Khayega where he urged residents to back his bid. Ikana said he is best suited for the job and has been on the ground since 2018. “My priority will be in the education sector ensuring all needy students will get an education through bursaries and my own network of friends," he said. The candidate said he is already providing full scholarships to more than 300 students through Ikana Maendeleo initiative. "I will also ensure our roads are fixed to ease movement, put up modern classrooms in schools and ensure residents access the required medical services paid for by the government,” Ikana said. He urged security agencies and the IEBC to ensure a conducive environment for free, fair and credible elections. “We have learned from the 2007 script which led to the loss of many lives, property and hurt the economy. We shouldn’t ruin what we have achieved because of a one-day event," Ikana said. “I am urging my supporters and other Kenyans to write a new history of peaceful transition." Ikana is seeking to unseat MP Justus Kizito, who is running on DAP-K. Others in the race include former MP Silverse Anami (ODM), Patrick Isai (UDP), Hillary Shamia (UDA) and Ambeyi Ligabo (Federal Party). Edited by A.N
