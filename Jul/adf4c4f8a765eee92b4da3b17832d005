Kenya girls went down 20-17 to Uganda in the 2022 FIBA 3x3 Under-23 Nations League Africa South match at the Nyayo Stadium, Thursday. Even though the Kenyans lost for the third time to their neighbours, coach Tony Ochieng said all is not lost despite trailing 3-1 in the games with two series left. “We made some small mistakes that cost us the match. Besides, we could not even handle the pressure,” said the Kenyan tactician. The Kenyan quartet of Medina Okot, Jaqueline Kogo, Alexandria Adala and Babra Achieng had problems dealing with Uganda. Okot still the go-to player in the Kenyan team continued her exploits, sinking nine points as Kenya drubbed Benin 16-9. She was at it again in a 21-5 blow-out of Botswana. In the men's category, Kenya had nine points from Dolph Otieno as they squeezed a narrow 21-20 win over Benin. However, they lost 19-18 to Benin as Martin Buluma managed eight points. “We lost this game but I was happy with the way we performed. It was perhaps the best match we have played in the tournament,” opined Ochieng. Rwanda won their second finals, beating Uganda 21- 16 to move closer to clinching the series. Other results saw Botswana go down 21-19 to Uganda while Rwanda whipped Benin 21-6
