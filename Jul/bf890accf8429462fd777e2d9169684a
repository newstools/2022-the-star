Police officers from Kayole arrested a medical student at Makindu Medical Training College after he staged his own kidnapping to milk money from his parents. The 23-year-old suspect went missing on Sunday before he blocked calls from his father and called his mother, claiming to have been kidnapped. Directorate of Criminal Investigation boss George Kinoti said the suspect said his kidnappers wanted a ransom of Sh70,000 to set him free before he hanged up on the mother. "His distraught parents reported the matter to police officers who immediately launched a manhunt for the kidnappers," Kinoti said. However, the calls persisted with the suspect telling his mother that his kidnappers were on the verge of eliminating him. "Determined to secure the life of their son, they sent Sh10,000 on Wednesday via mobile money and an additional Sh40,000 on Thursday," Kinoti said. Immediately after the suspect received the initial Sh10,000, he went to a club in Thika to have drinks in the company of a woman he had met. The woman is said to have spiked his drink and stolen the cash. "After regaining consciousness, he called again and his parents sent a further Sh40,000 which he withdrew and secured in his shoes," Kinoti added. Upon questioning, the student said that he had squandered the money meant for his last semester’s school fees and was wondering how he would raise the fees in order to sit his exams. He further disclosed that he had been ‘kidnapped’ alongside two other students whose parents had paid their ransoms. Detectives recovered Sh38,600 from the student who is now in custody at Kayole police station pending arraignment.
