The US has asked the government in the Democratic of Congo to protect UN peacekeepers and their facilities amid protests in the country. Protests against the UN mission in the country, known as Monusco, have since Monday resulted in the deaths of 19 people – including three peacekeepers. "We call on the national and local authorities in the [DR Congo] to ensure the protection of Monusco sites and personnel and for protesters to express their sentiments peacefully," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Thursday. The US said attacks against UN personnel and their sites was against international law and appreciated DR Congo government’s “commitment to investigating these events”. Mr Price noted that Monusco serves “a critical role in fostering peace and security, protecting civilians, and facilitating delivery of humanitarian assistance”.
