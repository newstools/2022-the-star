Roots party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah has said he will only attend the debate if he will be debating with the Azimio and Kenya Kwanza presidential candidates. "The decision is informed by the fact that the polls used as a determinant to pair the presidential candidates are not factual because they are conducted by the pollsters with interests in some of the political parties participating in the presidential debate," he said.
