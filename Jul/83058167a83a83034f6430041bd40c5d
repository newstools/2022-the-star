The national government has started issuing 39,000 title deeds in Kilifi county. Kilifi county commissioner Kutswa Olaka said the exercise is meant to ensure all title deeds at the Kilifi lands office are taken to the owners. Olaka said the programme will run up to July 20. “The government processed these titles and because most people are not coming for them, we will go to where they are. We will traverse all the subcounties in Kilifi county to make sure the title deeds are issued to the right people,” he said. The administrator warned that rogue land officials could take advantage of the title deeds and change their details. He said most people shy away from collecting titles for fear of being targeted by their children. “Some elders do not want to come for these documents because they know they may be targeted by their children who would want to sell the land. This is the reason we sensitise the community to sell land and also to desist from killing the elderly. Let us use these documents to unite our communities but not to kill each other,” he said. Olaka directed the district land boards to make sure every man who wishes to sell his land is accompanied by his wife to the board. He said some men sell the land without consulting their wives. Former Devolution CAS Gideon Mung’aro urged the county commissioner to make plans for DCCs to be given titles for every subcounty to reduce the amount of money people use to travel to Kilifi for the document. “Some people would wish to come to Kilifi for the documents but they do not have bus fares. The land office in partnership with your office can organise to have the titles at the DCCs office so that people can pick them from there,” he added
