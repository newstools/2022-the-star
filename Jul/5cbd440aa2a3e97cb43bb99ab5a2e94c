Suba South member of parliament John Mbadi on Monday survived a grisly accident in Siaya. The MP was on his way home at night from the launch of Siaya Senator James Orengo's manifesto when the accident happened. Orengo is vying for the governor's seat. Mbadi disclosed that everyone escaped unhurt from the accident. "Thanks, everyone for your concerns over the accident. While it was grisly, I'm happy to report that I and my crew left the scene unhurt and we thank God almighty," he said. "We are comforted by the prayers of the psalmist that, 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." In a picture seen by the Star newspaper, the car had been badly hit on the left side. The side mirror was also missing. Kenyans took to social media to sympathize with him. "May the one above be praised for sparing your life. A life that will deliver Homa bay and Kenya as a whole" said Aben Janyidho. Calvince Odhiambo on his part said: "May God continue to protect you, we give many thanks to him". "Glory be to God," said Susan Mugera. "Ooh my God, we thank God for keeping you safe," Betty Achi said. Mbadi dropped his Homa Bay county gubernatorial bid in favour of Gladys Wanga and joined the Azimio national campaign team.
