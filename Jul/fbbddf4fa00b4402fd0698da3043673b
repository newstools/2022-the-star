Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro has dismissed recent opinion polls that indicated Azimio presidential candidate, Raila Odinga is leading. Ndindi argued that the opinion polls do not depict the reality exuding confidence that Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto will win. The legislator observes that some people interfere with the polls to give the wrong impression to citizens. “In 2013, 2017 general election most opinion polls indicated Raila Odinga was to win but Jubilee won by a landslide,” he said. He spoke on Monday while issuing driving licenses to youth from his constituency, who were trained by the NG-CDF. More than 600 young people, majority from the boda boda sector received smart driving licenses. Ndindi asked the Azimio team to be ready to accept defeat saying their intelligence and scientific research show Kenya Kwanza will get a big win. “In every corner of this country, our presidential candidate has huge support because he has promised to lift the social welfare of the poor. We are sure he will win and Azimio should be ready to accept defeat,” he said. He said after they win, there would be no handshake or coalition government. “Kenyans are suffering but unfortunately nothing has been done to lower the cost of living. Our priority is to lower prices of basic commodities and create jobs for young people,” he said. He castigated Azimio leaders for accusing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of trying to manipulate the outcome of the election. “Kenya Kwanza is confident with IEBC no matter which register they use. Those accusing IEBC of planned rigging have sensed defeat and we assure them that once we clinch the power, we will not allow any post-election chaos,” he said. Ndindi, who exuded confidence in retaining his seat urged for a big voter turnout in Central Kenya. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
