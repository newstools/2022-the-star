Police officers staged a pre-poll peace walk in Bungoma town to emphasise the importance of unity and harmony. The walk on Friday was also to reassure the public that they can trust the police to keep the peace as professionals. They came from Bungoma's nine constituencies. Other peace marches by police are being held around the country. Bungoma county police commander Dr Musyoki Mutungi said on Friday the peace walk is a national exercise organised by Police IG Hillary Mutyambai and the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI). Speaking at the county commissioner's office, he said the purpose was to preach peace among the public in Bungoma and environs. “This peace walk should be taken seriously because it will be done nationally to spread a peace message,” he said. All key sectors have been involved in an ongoing peace initiative, he said. He said police are working closely with county commissioner Samuel Kimiti to ensure peace gets first priority before, during and after the general election on August 9. Mutungi urged the public to exercise their democratic right to vote and then let the IEBC announce the winner. “Once you cast your vote, go back home and follow the election on media platforms," he said. After all 47 counties hold police peace marches, a national march will held in Nairobi with county representatives and national security officials. Mutungi said police intelligence has started collecting information in Bungoma to identify places where there might be violence. “We have put all plans in place to ensure residents take part in peaceful elections and choose their leaders without violence," he said. He warned anyone planning to cause violence to stay away. Kimiti praised the police and said, "Police are not happy to arrest law offenders at this time. Let's remain peaceful as we conduct elections." (Edited by V. Graham)
