The government will carry out a Sh6.5 billion 'soft security' peace programme to end perennial conflict in the four Amaya Triangle counties. It will focus on literacy, jobs, livelihoods and water for domestic use and livestock. The counties are Laikipia, Baringo, Isiolo and Samburu that neighbour each other. Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi on Wednesday announced the government will initiate the long-term soft security programme. He said the government is still working on alternative sources of livelihoods for the youth in the counties. “This 6.5 billion shilling Amaya Triangle Initiative soft security programme is a very important agenda in my second term. "That is what will ensure a lasting peace and prosperity in Laikipia and the neighbouring counties,” Muriithi said. The governor spoke at Azimio la Umoja secretariat in Nanyuki town after receiving 97 political activists who defected from other political formations, joining his campaigns. Muriithi said his first-term government has opened up, graded and gravelled 300 kilometers of road in the newly created Kirima subcounty. It is on the border of the troubled troubled Laikipia-Baringo border, easing movement of people and goods. If he is reelected, he said,small urban centres would be modernised with water, electricity and paved roads, attracting more investment. That would also create more jobs for youth usually involved in violence clashes. He pledged to increase investment in the County Policing Authority and work closely with the national government. This cooperation would equip security teams for crime prevention and fast response to crime. Muriithi said his government would continue supporting the training of new National Police Reservists at the county Inspectorate Training Centre in Rumuruti. Other interventions will include construction of additional security roads and promoting peaceful coexistence, he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
