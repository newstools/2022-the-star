Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka's chopper experienced a technical hitch while on his way to Homa Bay for the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance rallies. The problem occurred when he arrived at Suswa, Narok county, forcing him to disembark from the chopper for the problem to be sorted. Kalonzo was to be part of the Azimio team that held its first major rally in Oyugis, Homa Bay county but he could not make it. The revelation on the technical hitch was first made by Wiper party member Andrew Sunkuli, who Kalonzo appointed as his running mate before he quit the race in favour of Raila. "I am here now to represent and pass the greetings of the Wiper leader Kalonzo. He was on his way here but the chopper he was travelling in experienced a small problem. But he will catch up with us in the course of the day," he said. It is not clear yet whether the problem was sorted out or another chopper was dispatched to take him to Homa Bay. The Wiper party leader shared that he was on his way to Homa Bay minutes before 2pm. He also confirmed that he experienced a technical problem. "Off to join my brother Raila Odinga and the Azimio-One Kenya team in Homabay County after a technicality that forced us to land in Suswa and delayed for some hours. The Buffalo is ready," he wrote on Facebook.
