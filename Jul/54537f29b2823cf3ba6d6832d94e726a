UDA presidential candidate William Ruto on Sunday faulted the Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti accusing him of interfering with the election process. Speaking at Kapkatet grounds in Kericho county on Sunday, Ruto said Kinoti should leave matters related to  Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to chairman Wafula Chebukati. He said Kinoti should not be the reason elections fail adding that he has failed as DCI boss. "Kinoti you were given the mandate to conduct investigations. Stop the theatrics and give IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati space to conduct elections," Ruto said. "He was given work to do criminals investigations, he has never done anything, all the cases he took to newspaper and when told to produce evidence to court, he has none." Ruto's was talking in reference to the case between the IEBC and the DCI on the arrest of the three Venezuelans at JKIA with materials meant to be used during elections. Chebukati said that the trio was tasked to aid IEBC in deploying Kiems kits across the country. On the other hand, DCI Kinoti, in a detailed statement, questioned why no IEBC officials were present at the airport to receive the foreigners and the highly confidential materials. Ruto also asked president Uhuru Kenyatta not to allow, the security agencies, people who have sinister motives to intimidate or blackmail the IEBC to undermine elections. "You have two weeks as President of Kenya, you have a constitutional duty, to make sure that we have free fair and democratic elections, we know you are also the chairman of Azimio, please don't confuse your duties as the chairman of Azimio and your duties as the president of Kenya, you must serve Kenyans equally," Ruto said.
