As Kenyans prepare for August 9 general election, keeping peace should be their main focus. Kenya is bigger than any one of us, including the politicians seeking elective offices. And most importantly, no Kenyan has another place to call home other than this beautiful nation. For this reason, all politicians must, as a matter of patriotic duty, tone down their strident rabble-rousing rhetoric, desist from hate speech and incitement to violence. Any leader worth his salt must pause; self reflect and remember that their ambitions for office must not cost a single life. For the rest of law-abiding citizens, regardless of your political affiliation, know that keeping peace is your cardinal role in the lead up to the polls and beyond. Firstly it’s patriotic duty. Secondly, it is sensible and responsible to maintain the peace because in war there is never a winner. Remember, when you vote, you have no business hanging around groups absorbed in idle tittle-tattle. Whatever the results, any aggrieved party has the leeway to approach a court of law in search of justice. A law-abiding society must use well defined channels to resolve disputes anything short of that is a recipe for chaos.
