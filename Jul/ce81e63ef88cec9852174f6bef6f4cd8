Construction of 7.7-kilometre roads and a mega bridge within Narok town is on course and expected to be completed in March next year. The cost is Sh680 million. Rift Valley regional commissioner Maalim Mohamed said the road and its drainage system will help control flash floods in the town during rainy seasons. A large bridge is being constructed across the Narok River. He spoke when he led the Regional Development Implementation Coordination Committee to inspect the roads. Maalim was accompanied by the Narok Development and Implementation Committee led by commissioner Isaac Masinde. The regional commissioner asked the contractor to fast-track the works so residents can benefit from drainage structures that are a twin box culvert and a mega bridge near the Narok GK Prison. He said already, the contractor has been paid Sh260 million and has done more than 70 per cent of the works. “The contractor won the contract because he proved he had the financial capability of doing the work. We expect the work to be completed within the timelines,” Mohamed said. The construction is being supervised by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (Kura). The roads are being upgraded to bitumen standards by Sinoe Construction Limited. The project includes 3.6km Kims Breeze-Polung’a Road, 1.96km Olmarei Lang’ Road, 0.74km Ensda-Africa Hope Road, 0.8km bridge approaches and a 0.6km Commissioner's Loop Road. The construction followed a presidential directive, after Narok traders requested President Uhuru Kenyatta to construct the roads to curb floods during the Madaraka Day celebrations held at William Ole Ntimama stadium in 2019. The road will also decongest the town as it will offer an alternative route to drivers on the Bomet-Narok-Maai Mahiu highway. Works began in June 2020, with a contract period of 31 months.
