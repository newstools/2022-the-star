Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoya and her running mate Justina Wamae have faulted the debate secretariat for not honouring the party conditions for the debate. Wajackoya claims that he has pulled out of the debate because of discrimination. "We have written letters asking why we should not debate all the four candidates on the same podium. So that Kenyans can judge for themselves how we present our points," he said. He said they had written several letters and they had not been responded to. Wajackoyah claimed the party was denied its right to participate in the debate. Wamae also reiterated that their efforts to engage the debate secretariat on the conditions failed to materialise. "You have seen that we have gone to the debate venue, letters were written but they never responded. We decided to humble ourselves and went there. We were not given appropriate feedback," she said. Wajackoya said that they will continue with their campaigns to drum up support for their bid. He said the party will campaign in Mombasa, Isiolo and Marsabit in the coming week. In a statement, Wajackoyah had initially announced he will not attend the presidential debate. He said he will not be subjected to 'the joke of an already predetermined debate'. "We would like to state that our presidential candidate Prof Wajackoyah will not attend the presidential debate because we will not subject the incoming President to the joke of an already predetermined debate," reads the statement.
