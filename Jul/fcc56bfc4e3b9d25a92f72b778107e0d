YouTube has announced that it wants to add a feature that allow creators to turn their longer videos into shorts by introducing an edit tool button. The feature will be available for both iOS and Android applications, allowing creators to select up to 60 seconds from their YouTube videos to bring into the shorts and edit. YouTube says users will also have the ability to add texts, filters and additional videos from their gallery. It hopes this will help creators create promotional videos for their YouTube channel as the finished edited short will have a link to their YouTube channel. YouTube has put a lot of focus on shorts since it started rolling out the feature in 2020.
