In a statement released this week, the session pitting Gachagua and Karua will be moderated by KTN News' Sophia Wanuna and NTV's James Smart. The session will take place between 8.00 and 9.30 p.m on Tuesday. However, the Presidential campaign director of communication Hussein Mohammed on Friday revealed it was upon Gachagua to decide if he will attend the debate or not. “Whether or not the candidate (Ruto) and the running mate will appear is a matter that firmly rests with them,” he said. Notably, the face-off will be preceded by a debate between running mates of presidential candidates who garnered less than 5 per cent in the three of the most recent opinion polls. The duel pitting Roots party's Justina Wamae and Agano's Ruth Mutua will be moderated by TV47 presenter Linda Alela and KBC's Jacob Kioria. Citizen TV's Trevor Ombija will moderate the panel discussions that will take part before and after both debates. Moderators will be required to perform certain duties and adhere to certain rules.
