For this frozen beverage, you can add vodka, gin, rum, or even tequila if you want a cocktail. The slush consistency comes from the combination of frozen watermelon and ice. Note that if the watermelon chunks are at room temperature or even refrigerated, all you will have is liquid juice. Ensure the watermelon chunks are frozen for better results. Ingredients Preparation Step 1: Freeze your watermelon overnight. Using a blender, add the frozen watermelon, ice, ginger ale, lime juice, water, and sugar then blend. Step 2: Pour into glasses and garnish with watermelon slices and lime slices. Enjoy with friends and family.
