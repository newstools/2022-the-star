Instagram has announced that it will make it easy for users to locate businesses through a new updated searchable and dynamic map experience. The map will allow users to explore popular tagged locations around them at the same time get to filter location results by specific categories including salons, cafes, streets and restaurants. According to the company CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, you can discover new places by tapping location tags in stories or posts on the feed. You can find relevant locations on the map when searching certain hashtags as well. The new filter option will help you to narrow down or move the map around to look at what is nearby by clicking search. You can also save locations if you want to check them out later. (You access saved places by going to your profile, tapping the hamburger menu in the top right, and tapping saved.) Meta says the new map is now available on Instagram after testing it in certain countries and now the feature has now been rolled out globally for all users.
