Former Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju now says he and DCI boss George Kinoti will have to leave the country in the event  UDA leader William Ruto wins the August 9 general elections. He says the latest attacks directed at Kinoti are tell-tale signs that things will be tough for him in the event Ruto wins. "Mimi nafikiria mtu kama Kinoti na labda Raphael Tuju, tutatafuta nchi ingine ya kuenda... Kwanza Kinoti atalazimishwa aende exile. (I think someone like Kinoti and myself, we will have to find another country to go to... Especially for Kinoti, he will be forced to exile)" he said. Speaking in an interview on a local TV channel on Monday, Tuju expressed confidence in his words, adding that he had no fear of contradiction in what will befall Kinoti. He claimed that Ruto responding to a letter addressed by Kinoti to the IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati, was a sign that the Deputy President was picking a fight with the DCI boss. "Now that he (Ruto) has started fights with Kinoti, if he wins, will Kinoti live here in our country Kenya?" he posed. On Sunday, speaking during campaigns in Kericho, Ruto said Kinoti was being dramatic over the arrest three Venezuelan officials. "We want to tell this guy who is fond of theatrics going by the name Kinoti to stop the nonsense. He is a complete failure who dramatizes cases through media reports only for him to fail in court," he said. Tuju dismissed Ruto's claims and acknowledged Kinoti's position saying Kenyans are safe owing to the duties of people like the DCI boss. "That is why you have not heard of a terrorist attack in the last two-three years. It's because of Kinoti." "Now that is the person that someone wants to fire. Kinoti is the director of DCI and that does not depend on the contest," he added.
