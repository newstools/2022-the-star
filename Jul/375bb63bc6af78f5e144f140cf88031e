Sirisia MP John Waluke has said Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga is the best person to revive the economy. Waluke noted that Raila has always supported devolution and he should be given a chance to serve the nation. "The ODM boss is the father of devolution. If given the chance to be the President he will do much better to save the country and revive the economy," he said. Waluke was speaking on Wednesday in Khachonge village during the burial of Nicholas Wangamati, brother to Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. The Sirisia lawmaker dismissed the Kenya Kwanza Alliance ticket of Deputy President William Ruto and his running mate Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua, saying the duo won’t win in the August 9 general election. He said he was once the UDA chairman in Bungoma county but ditched the outfit after sensing that they will lose to Azimio. Waluke revealed more reasons why he left the DP Ruto-led alliance by citing his discomfort in working with one of the alliance's top honchos, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula. “In 2007, Wetang’ula intimidated me when I was competing with him for the Sirisia MP seat before it was partitioned into Sirisia and Kabuchai constituency," Waluke said. DAP-K leader Wafula Wamunyinyi said the Azimio team has put in place a plan to ensure Senator Wetang’ula is defeated in his quest to retain his Bungoma Senate seat. Waluke urged Kenyans to follow President Uhuru Kenyatta’s advice and vote for the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Coalition presidential flag bearer as his successor. “We should all listen to what the President told us on Tuesday while issuing the title deeds. We should vote for Raila Odinga, because before the President makes such a bold step to back the former prime minister he is aware and knows why he is the best to succeed him,” Waluke said.
