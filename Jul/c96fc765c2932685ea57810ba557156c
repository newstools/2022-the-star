Roots Party presidential running mate Justina Wamae and her Agano Party counterpart Ruth Mucheru have arrived at the Catholic University for East Africa ready for the deputy presidential debate. The candidates were given an opportunity to pick from a ruffle box who would speak first when the debate gets underway. Justina will speak first. She was full of excitement stating that she will use the opportunity to clear the air about some aspects in their manifesto. Proposals in the Roots Party manifesto have earned Justina and his presidential candidate George Wajackoya praise and criticism in equal measure. "I'm here to distigmatise our manifesto so I'm energised and I'm syked up," Justina said. Controversial proposals in the Roots Party manifesto include suspension of the Constitution, legalisation of cannabis, commercialization of snake rearing and exportation of hyena testicles for medicinal use in China. The duo has argued that marijuana will only be legalised for medicinal use but those critical of the proposal have raised questions about its misuse. "I prepared accordingly. You know Kenyans are very bright so I need to come off smart," Justina said. The debate will be moderated by Zubeida Koome and Francis Gachuri and will be beamed live across TV and radio stations.
