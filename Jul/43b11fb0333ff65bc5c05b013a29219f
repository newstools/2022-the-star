Police in Etago, Kisii county, have arrested ten suspects in connection with the abduction and killing of a 71-year-old granny over a land sale deal gone sour. Among those seized as the prime suspect is her son - Moses Abuya- who addressed journalists at home on Thursday. The son is accused of hiring assassins to slaughter his mother –Yunis Bitengo, a widow,-after she allegedly refused to budge to his demands to hive off part of the family land for sale. Others in custody are a woman, said to be a village elder, some three other youths and five elderly men. The suspects were picked after a handwritten confession letter listing their names was found along a path. According to the letter, the son is said to have paid Sh4000 as an initial deposit for his mother’s killing. He was due to pay an additional Sh2000 after the completion of the mission. Villagers had found the hand and scarf of the woman during a search while the body is still missing four weeks after the incident. Her limb was found inside a maize farm, a kilometre away from her house at Getonto village in Nyakeyo. On Tuesday, detectives said they are still following up on crucial leads which may lead to the arrest of several more other suspects. "We are still following useful leads which may lead to the arrest of the remaining suspects; it is a matter of days," said one of the officers conducting a probe into the incident. Bitengo was taking brew at a home in the village before she was dragged away at night and killed. Police said the suspects already in custody are yet to disclose where the other parts of the body are. “No stone will be left unturned, every suspect linked to her killing and the subsequent disappearance of the body will all be brought to book,” said the officer who did not want to disclose his identity for fear of compromising the investigations. The suspects will be arraigned this week.
