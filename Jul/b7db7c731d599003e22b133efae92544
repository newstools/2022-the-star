A Kibera court has jailed a man accused of stealing Dumuzaz mabati worth Sh4.1 million Wesley Kipkemoi Cheruiyot was convicted by Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke after the prosecution proved the case against him. The prosecution called six witnesses who testified in court before the man was sent to jail. According to the prosecution, Cheruiyot drove a truck registration number KCA 960G from Kericho to Mombasa  where he was to pick the iron sheets. The iron sheets were stolen on January 15, 2017, at an unknown place and time within the Republic of Kenya. The court was informed that on January 16, 2017, the truck was found parked on the road by police officers near Parklands police station. The accused person was inside the truck looking sleepy or unconscious. He was taken to MP Shah Hospital where treatment and first aid were allegedly done. His manager, who was the witness in the case, was also called to the hospital where they found the accused person. The man was later released from the hospital and recorded statements with the police. He was then charged with the offence of stealing after the tracking system showed that he made some movements from what he disclosed himself. The court heard that the tracking system was stopped after the accused person drove to Mlolongo at a certain junction. The court was told the accused person decided to take some sleeping pills, and that at the MP Shah Hospital, no treatment was administered. In his defence, the accused person told the court that he picked the iron sheets, and when he reached the Machakos junction, he decided to take a rest because there was a heavy traffic jam. He further said he ate some boiled eggs, yoghurt and cakes and, thereafter, lost consciousness. The magistrate, however, dismissed the allegations. She ruled that the accused person never said in his defence what happened to the complainant’s items and  convicted him to five years in jail.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
