Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has asked youths and women to be alert not to be misused by politicians ahead of the polls. The county boss said falling into the trap of politicians' lies can make the electorate make wrong choices when voting. Nyoro was speaking to women leaders at Jumuiya Conference and Country Home in Limuru constituency on Wednesday “We have few days to the August vote and you will see politicians doing anything to woo women and youths,” he said. He urged the residents to elect him for a five-year term to realise his development plan for the county. Nyoro,  took over after former governor Ferdinard Waititu was impeached. He has served the county for two years. "I am asking you to give me a chance to serve you for a five-year term. I’m sure we shall achieve more than we did in my two years at the helm,” he said. The governor is vying on a Jubilee ticket and will face Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria (CCK), former governor William Kabogo (Tujibebe Party), Senator Kimani Wamatangi (UDA) and Mwende Gatabaki of Safina.
