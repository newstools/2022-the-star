An Embu man was found dead in his house on Monday in suspected suicide. The incident happened in Kabandi village in Embu East subcounty. Subcounty police commander Emmanuel Okanda said the deceased left a suicide note that cited family wrangles. "It's sad to confirm that a 36-year-old man died by suicide inside his house in Kabandi village in Kyeni North, Embu East. "We also found the letter he had written before his death, which stated family wrangles as the cause of his suicide," he said. Okanda urged residents to seek help from government agencies and social institutions instead of taking their lives. "I would like to say that majority of Embu East residents are facing mental stress due to changing lifestyles and high cost of living. "Although this should not lead them to suicide and criminal acts. They should seek help," Okanda said. Elsewhere, a 22-year-old man was on Monday found dead after he was allegedly attacked by an angry mob. The man is suspected to have raped of a 100-year-old woman in Karundori, Embu East. Okanda said the man escaped with serious injuries, which they suspect led to his death. He however, warned residents against taking such steps urging them to report the incidents to the security organs. "I would advise people to report criminal cases to the police instead of taking the matter into their hands, since this will make it difficult for police investigations," Okanda said. The bodies of the two were taken to Kyeni Consolata Mission Hospital mortuary as police launched investigations. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
