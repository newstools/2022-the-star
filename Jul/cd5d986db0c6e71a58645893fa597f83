The government missed its loan repayment target by Sh109.05 billion by the close of the 2021-22 financial year, an expenditure report shows. The nonpayment — the CoB says it's not a default — came during an acute cash crunch that hit the government last year after it failed to receive some funds from lenders. A status report on Consolidated Funds Services exchequer issued as of June 30 this year shows the Treasury spent Sh1.04 trillion on debt repayment. This is against the revised budget of Sh1.15 trillion, causing  a Sh109.05 billion deficit that the Treasury did not bridge by the end of the fiscal year. This may have made the Treasury default on the repayment of loans that had fallen due. However, Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang’o sought to allay fears of a default, stating the government cannot afford to default on public debt. “For public debt, we cannot afford to default. So, I can only imagine that these are debts that spilled over to early July,” Nyakang’o told the Star. Initially, the Treasury had planned to spend Sh1.16 trillion. During the year, the Treasury expected to receive Sh115 billion from a Eurobond but it cancelled the bond. Treasury CS Ukur Yatani had cited the rising cost of financing the debt in the wake of the depreciating Kenyan currency against the dollar. “Last year we borrowed at six per cent and now it stands at more than 12 per cent. This is no longer feasible,” Yatani said last month. In the just-ended financial year, the Treasury borrowed Sh1.04 trillion out of a target of Sh1.47 trillion to plug the budget deficit. Some Sh1.04 trillion went towards repayment of the debt. The revelations were made as Treasury data showed that public debt increased from Sh8.4 trillion in March to Sh8.56 trillion by the end of May. The debt now stands at 69.1 per cent of the country’s GDP. It comprises Sh4.26 trillion in domestic debt and Sh4.29 trillion stock in external debt. “Domestic and external debt stock accounted for 49.8 and 50.2 percent of total debt stock, respectively,” the National Treasury’s monthly debt bulletin in May 2022 read. Overall, the national government's external debt stock increased by Sh51.57 billion from Sh4.24 trillion in April 2022. “This was attributed to disbursements and foreign exchange rates movement,” the report read. Debt owed to bilateral creditors increased by Sh21.22 billion from Sh1.08 trillion, while multilateral debt increased by Sh28.50 billion from Sh1.87 trillion. Commercial debt decreased by Sh0.65 billion from Sh1.12 trillion during the same period. Publicly guaranteed external debt marginally increased from Sh156.39 billion in April 2022 to Sh158.89 billion in May 2022, according to the report. On other hand, some Sh963.72 billion was incurred on debt repayment as of May 31,according to the Treasury report. This includes Sh286.24 billion for external debt service and Sh677.48 billion for domestic debt servicing. “The actual cumulative domestic debt interest payment as at end of May 2022 stood at Sh427.25 billion,” the report read.
