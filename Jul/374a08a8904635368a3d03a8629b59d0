Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has dismissed the claims that he forwarded his name for MP nominations after the August 9 elections. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Kuria pointed out that it was against the law for him to send his name for nomination when he is vying for an elective seat. He is running for the governor position in Kiambu County. "It is simply not true that I have forwarded my name to be nominated as an MP. My single minded focus is to be elected Governor of Kiambu County and to have William Ruto as President," he wrote. Kuria exuded confidence in that both him and his Alliance boss have the peoples' votes, saying, "both outcomes are assured and what remains is a formality". The legislator vowed never to pursue politics again if he is not voted in as governor. "In the unlikely event I am not elected, you will not see me in politics again let alone seeking to be nominated. There is life beyond politics," he said. On Monday, claims emerged that his CCK party had forwarded his name to Parliament, as a back up plan in case he lost his governer bid. Kuria is running against Senator Kimani Wamatangi of UDA, former Governor William Kabogo of Tujibebe Party and independent candidate Patrick 'WaJungle' Wainaina. Names of those who have submitted their names for nomination were released on Sunday by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commision. Among them are Starehe MP Charles Njagua, Nairobi Woman Rep candidate Karen Nyamu, both from UDA.
