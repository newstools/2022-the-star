UDA presidential candidate William Ruto on Monday bought a second-hand jacket for Sh20,000 in the Gikomba market. Ruto was leading campaigns at the expansive market together with his Kenya Kwanza allies when a trader offered him the jacket. “Wacha sasa tupige bei. Hii ni ngapi,” Ruto asked. The lady asked for Sh2,000 for the short-sleeved jacket upon which the DP jokingly said it was much. “Apana elfu mbili ni mingi. Bei ya jioni, huyu mama anataka kuninyoa bila maji, mimi nimechanuka bana usinione hivi,” Ruto said. The lady trader then told him she would offer him Sh500 discount and collect Sh1,500 for the clothing. At this point, the DP reached into his pocket and fished out a bundle of notes saying “haya shika hii elfu ishirini ujipange nayo.” Ruto has modelled his campaign strategy around a promise to better the lives of ordinary Kenyans by uplifting small businesses. The Bottom-up economic model, he argues, seeks to empower the common mwananchi and the bottom of the economic pyramid as opposed to the current trickle-down model. Ruto argues that if mama mbogas, boda boda riders and the youth are empowered to do business, it will spur the economy by way of ensuring every ordinary Kenyan citizen has money in their pocket.
