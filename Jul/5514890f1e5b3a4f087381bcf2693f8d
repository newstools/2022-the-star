Kenya Judo Association (KJA) chairman Shadrack Maluki reckons the country will reap handsomely from African Cadet and Junior Championships set to begin on Thursday this week at Moi International Stadium, Kasarani. A total of 69 judokas from 12 countries will participate in the African Cadet Championships set for July 21 to 22. Thereafter, another group of 116 judokas from 16 countries will grace the two-day Africa Junior Championships set for July 23 to 24. Kenya has registered for the continental showpieces alongside South Africa, Egypt, Madagascar, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Angola, Botswana, Uganda, Algeria, Guinea, Zambia, and the Comoros Islands. “The event means a lot for Kenya and I believe it will open many other opportunities,” Maluki said. “We appreciate all the efforts the government has made to develop the sport in the country. This particular event wouldn’t have materialized without the government’s support,” he added. All the participants will be housed at the Movenpick Hotel in Westlands Nairobi for the entire duration of the event. The championships will also serve as a qualifier Paris 2024 Olympic Games. They will also be used as a precursor to the 2022 Conakry Junior African Cup set for September 25. Maluki said hosting the event will open doors for Kenya to host major events including Grand Slams and the Grand Prix. “Clearly, Kenya has come of age and we are liaising closely with the government with our sights firmly set on the two major championships,” Maluki said. The Paris 2022 Grand Slam was hosted in February, where 285 judokas drawn from 52 countries took part. International Judo Federation (IJF) Vice President Randrianasolo Niak-Siteney is already in the country to flag off the event. Siteney is a Member of Parliament in Madagascar and doubles up as the official opposition leader.
