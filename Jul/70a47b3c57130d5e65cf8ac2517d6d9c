The Easy on Me singer told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs over the weekend that she would like to give her nine-year-old son Angelo a couple of siblings. "I definitely would like a couple more kids. It would be wonderful. If not, I've got Angelo." Adele shares Angelo with her ex-husband Simon Konecki, whom she both married and separated from in 2018. Reflecting on their divorce in 2021, the British singer said she is thankful she didn't have a "messy" split.
