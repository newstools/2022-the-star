Reports that a woman was fined Sh23,000 by small claims court for 'eating fare' are fake. 'Eating fare' is a slung for an instance where a man or woman sends a partner money to visit him or her only to end up failing to appear. On Thursday, a report emerged on social media of a woman said to have been fined heavily for failing to visit her boyfriend even after being sent a bus fare. The fake report indicated that the woman was to attend a birthday party but she missed it and switched off her phone. Fact-checker has, however, established that the reports are fake. The Judiciary has flagged such a report as fake and asked Kenyans to disregard it. Kenyans on social media had weighed on the report giving mixed reactions to it. Among those who fell prey to the fake news is former Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko. "I did not know that you can sue a woman for eating your fare and have your cash refunded with interest, if this happened during my youthful days, I would have sued 5000 women," he said in reaction to the fake report.
