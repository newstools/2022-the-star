Police have recovered bhang cultivated in a rental house within Elgon View estate in Eldoret. Police said they recovered 21 cannabis plants in the main bedroom, 68 in the sitting room, 14 in the dining room, 26 in an adjacent iron sheet walled house. This was after a thorough search was done in the two buildings within the compound on Tuesday. Police said they also found personal assorted documents in the building. "All the plants were uprooted after having been documented by DCI Scenes of Crime personnel. The plants weighed 33.5 Kgs with a street value of about one million Kenya Shillings," police said. Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects. They have appealed to the public to give any information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects. "We urge the public to desist from engaging in criminal activities," police said. This comes in the wake of the sustained war on narcotics in the country. Last week, five relatives were arrested and cocaine valued at Sh15 million recovered in separate operations in Nairobi. The first operation was conducted by DCI anti-narcotics sleuths who raided a house in the upmarket Kileleshwa estate and arrested a wanted drug trafficker. The main suspect has been on police radar after investigations revealed that he was making suspicious trips to Uganda and back. Further, investigations established that  the suspect was part of a well-networked drug trafficking ring based in Nairobi with ties to Uganda, Ethiopia and Brazil, specialising in smuggling of cocaine for domestic distribution and export. During the search at his house, about 15 pellets of suspected cocaine narcotic substance were recovered from at Vue Claire apartments, Kileleshwa. In another room within the house police recovered a Ceska CZ 75 pistol case raising a lid on the involvement of the 27-year-old in deeper organized crime.
