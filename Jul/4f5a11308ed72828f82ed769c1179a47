Veteran Nairobi City Stars' forward Ezekiel Odera has hailed the club’s staff, playing unit, and coaching staff after achieving a rare feat of winning the club’s 'Golden Boot' for the third time. Odera went into the club’s record books as the first player to win the club’s Golden Boot for the third time, surpassing three other players who had top-scored in over two seasons. Justus Basweti top-scored in the 2004/5 and 2006/7 seasons, Arthur Museve in the 2008 and 2009, Ugandan Dan Sserunkuma in 2011 and 2012, and Gambian hitman Ebrima Sanneh in the 2015 and 2019-20. Odera top-scored in the 2016 premier league and 2017 National Super League seasons with four and 11 goals respectively. “Playing for Nairobi City Stars as always has been joy for me as a player. The working conditions at the club have equally been favourable. I am happy and proud to wear a City Stars' jersey while representing the club,” said the 34-year-old. He added: “As a striker, my job is to score goals and that has never been a problem for me because I enjoy my football at the club. That explains the reasons behind being the top scorer in three different seasons and that makes me proud,” “I am always thankful to my employers and I am hopeful we will continue the good relationship with the club and help them achieve their objectives as a club.” In hitting double digits in the 2021/22 season, Odera surpassed the eight goals that made Sanneh and Peter Opiyo Simba Wa Nairobi top scorers in the 2019/20 National Super League and 2020/21 FKF Premier League seasons. Odera’s overall goals were reduced to nine after one of his goals in the 3-0 win over Mathare United was negated following the expulsion of the club from the league. He currently sits third behind Basweti and Francis Thairu in the all-time City Stars’ scoring record with 33 goals.
