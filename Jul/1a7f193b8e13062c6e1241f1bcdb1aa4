Agriculture CS Peter Munya has defended the Jubilee government over high food and fuel prices. He blamed the increase on the Russia-Ukraine war, Covid-19 and inadequate rainfall last season. The CS spoke on Wednesday while issuing tittle deeds to residents of Maua in Meru. He however said the government has plans to lower Unga prices by buying tax free maize from Zambia in the coming days. Munya said as government, they are trying to tackle the crisis and bring down food prices but Kenyans must know the crisis is not only in Kenya but even in America and UK. “We have to come to an agreement. I am not the person who is in charge of setting Unga prices but the Treasury and trade. We are one government and we must defend it. Relief food is also under special programmes and not my ministry," he said. The CS said there is a worldwide crisis and there have been protests even in UK due to hiked prices. “It is stupid for leaders to set blame on President Uhuru Kenyatta for the high cost of living. Maize prices have also hiked in Uganda, Tanzania and Congo but we have organised for exports from Zambia,” he said. Munya also drummed up support for Azimio La Umoja flagbearer Raila Odinga and his deputy Martha Karua saying this is the government that will cater for Kenyans needs and liberate them. He said he is confident Raila will be the next President of the Republic of Kenya after August 9 polls. Last week, Deputy President William Ruto and his allies attacked Munya saying the Agriculture ministry has failed farmers by allowing fertiliser prices to hike from Sh2,500 to Sh6,500. Ruto said Unga prices have gone up almost three times from Sh90 to Sh230, making it hard for some families to put a meal on the table. "From August 10, we shall change the face of Kenya with developments. Our track record is clear, don't ask what we did not achieve. All is not lost, we have a few days and Kenya will be on the upward trajectory," he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
