Kenya Ports Authority coach Anthony Ojukwu believes with good preparations, they can successfully defend the league and FIBA Africa Zone Five titles. Ojukwu said though the task is huge, he feels they are up to the challenge. He said they are committed to achieving their targets and returning to the Africa Club Championship podium once again. “As a coach and as a team, we always set our targets. It is always our wish to dine with the queens of Africa in basketball but to do that, we have to win the local league, Zone Five, and play in Africa Championships.” On the league front, the veteran tactician said the title race is a marathon and is still very open. “We will just stay focused and concentrate on the task ahead,” he noted. The on-form porters were in Nairobi over the weekend where they beat the University of Nairobi “Dynamites” and Equity Bank to top the league with 10 points from five wins. “So far, so good. The team is gelling well and the chemistry is there. It’s like wind, you can not see the wind but you can see the effects,” he said. Ojukwu said he is banking on his three national team players Jemimah Knight, Natalie Akinyi, and Seline Okumu to drive the team to success. “Jemimah is an asset, Natalie is the engine, Seline is the key. Seline opens and closes the defense,” she said. He added: “Belinda (Okoth), Rita (Aluoch) and Velma (Achieng) are equally amazing and so is the rest of the team. They are all special in a way.” He predicted a tough league considering that the other eleven coaches are also working hard. KPA, who have won the national league title sixteen times, remains highly favoured to carry the day.
