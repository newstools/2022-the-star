Nominated Member of Parliament Wilson Sossion has supported the electoral body in their concerns for reprinting the ballot papers, both on the grounds of cost and time constraints. The MP, who was speaking to Citizen TV on Thursday, said the judiciary should have issued the verdict to include Presidential aspirant Reuben Kigame on time before printing the papers. Sossion said,“It is public knowledge that ballot papers are not printed in Kenya; they’re very costly." He said there are only eighteen days to the general elections and the process requires much time to ensure that there are no faults. "The papers must be delivered on time to all the polling centres in order to facilitate the August 9 elections." he said. Electoral commission chair Wafula Chebukati had warned that including Reuben Kigame on the ballot may force postponement of next months presidential election. Apart from the technicalities of reprinting the ballots, the saga will cost the IEBC an additional Sh971 million, an amount the commission said is not within its budget. “The said processes, subject to availability of the budget, requires a minimum of 30 days, yet we are at 19 days to the general election,” Chebukati said in a statement. “The range of steps and processes required to give effect to the judgment may severely jeopardise the holding of presidential elections on August 9 being only 19 days from today.” Chebukati said the commission will be required to gazette the names of the presidential candidates afresh, to ensure the new list is fully within the framework of the law. "The 55,650 Kiems kits to be deployed to all the 47 counties and diaspora will also have to be recalled, reconfigured and programmed afresh," Chebukati said. The High Court ordered the IEBC to consider Kigame’s papers for review and approval on Monday.
