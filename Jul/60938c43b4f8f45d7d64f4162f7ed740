President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday unveiled the 5th stimulus package on food subsidies meant to help cushion Kenyans against the cost of living. Among them was ordering the maize flour packet to retail at Sh100 for a 2kg packet. "Maize flour shall retail across the entire territory of the country at the price of Sh100 down from Sh205 for a 2kg packet until otherwise directed," he said. While addressing the country at State House, Uhuru said his government through Treasury CS Ukur Yatani, had made a deal with all millers under the Agricultural Food Authority (AFA). The deal included suspension of the Railway Development Levy and the Import Declaration Fee (IDF) on all imported maize. Uhuru also announced that the government further suspended fees and levies that included KEPHIS & KEBS Testing Fee, Inspection Fee, Permit Fee on imported maize grain and raw materials for animal feeds. This will go on for a period of four months, with effect from July 1,  to October 31, 2022. The government subsidy on fuel prices was also among the stimulus. Uhuru pointed out that over the last year, the State has maintained a fuel subsidy programme amounting to Sh118 billion. "Without this state intervention, the pump prices would have been Sh193.64 for diesel, Sh209.95 for petrol and sh181.13 for Kerosene in Nairobi, and higher further inland," he added. With the subsidies, diesel goes for Sh14o, petrol at Sh159.12 and Kerosene is sold for Sh127.94. The President also announced that the prices of cooking gas will be reduced to Sh3,000 for 13 Kg-cylinder and Sh1,400 for 6 Kgs. Uhuru further announced that there has been a reduction in the cost of electricity to households by 15 per cent since January.
