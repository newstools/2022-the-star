Reigning race walk champion Heristone Wanyonyi is looking to retain his title at the World Under 20 Championships in Cali, Colombia in August. Wanyonyi said his focus has shifted from the Commonwealth Games to Cali after missing the 10km walk cut to Birmingham despite earning qualification time. He said he will be seeking a slot to represent the country in Colombia during the two-day World Under 20 Trials starting this Friday at the Nyayo Stadium. “I was hoping to compete at the Commonwealth Games but since I fell short at the Trials, I have opted to concentrate on defending my title in Colombia. I have prepared well for the junior Trials and I am in much better shape,” said Wanyonyi. Wanyonyi also failed to finish his 20km walk race during the Africa Senior Athletics championships in Reduit, Mauritius. He, however, says he has gained a lot in terms of endurance and learned a few new tricks from the championship. “I did not finish the race because I picked a muscle crumb injury at the 16th km mark that slowed me down. However, I am very disappointed since I wanted to use the Commonwealth Games to graduate into the senior cadre," he added. Athletics Kenya picked three-time African Senior Athletics champion Samuel Gathimba to fly the country's flag at the Commonwealth Games. “All the same, that is now water under the bridge. I have accepted and now I have to direct my energy on defending my title in Cali, Colombia,” he added. “I am also comfortable with the AK decision to give my brother Gathimba and sister Emily Ngii direct tickets to the World Championship and Commonwealth Games. Mine is to wish them all the best of luck," said Wanyonyi.
