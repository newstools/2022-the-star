The Isiolo county government has distributed 6000 title deeds to land owners in Oldonyiro and Ngaremara wards. Treasury CS Ukur Yattani presided over the exercise Monday through the department of land. He warned the new tittle owners not to disperse their land but instead use the document to acquire loans and develop the land. While addressing locals at the Ngaremara Catholic Church grounds during the handing over ceremony, Yattani appealed to residents to shun politicians who were out to divide communities along tribal lines and support those with the vision to drive the county forward. He said that Isiolo county can only prosper economically if the people elect visionary leaders who will complete the various development projects initiated by Governor Mohammed Kuti. Yatani was accompanied by Isiolo county secretary Ahmed Galgalo, County Commissioner Geoffrey Omoding and Lands CECM Yussuf Dahir among other leaders. The CS also took the opportunity to drum support for Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga saying he was destined to win the August 9 general election. He urged Isiolo residents to vote for the Azimio team that comprises Raila and running mate Martha Karua if they don't want to be left out of government.
