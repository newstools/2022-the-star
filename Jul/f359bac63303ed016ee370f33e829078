Over 500 young players are set to benefit from the newly launched program dubbed ‘Rugby in a Box’ for the next three years. The program was launched during the 2022 Rugby Festival which attracted 19 teams from various public schools and slum areas within the city. Kings Rugby Development Academy (KRDA) founder Stuart McGreevy said they want to reach many children in a bid to help them develop their talent. He said the program will alleviate the financial burden of investing in rugby considering many schools are serving children from underprivileged backgrounds. KRDA has also taken the initiative of training all the coaches for World Rugby certifications status public schools and organised groups in low-income areas will benefit from their knowledge. The Rugby festival was organized by KRDA and attended by Maro Itoje, England national rugby team player and Atlas Foundation Trustee. “You will see some more of those projects for rugby as we look to grow the sport in this country. For rugby to grow in the country and for Kenya to be a dominant force worldwide, it needs to happen in the schools,” Itoje said. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman Oduor Gangla said KRU are taking a very deliberate and conscious step towards supporting rugby academies like Kings Rugby mainly through training and development of the coaches.
