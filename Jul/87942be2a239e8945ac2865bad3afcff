Kitui Senatorial Aspirant Julius Mutukaa is mourning his firstborn son who perished in an accident that claimed 6 lives at Kwa Majini bridge, in Matuu, Machakos County on July 15. Mutukaa said his firstborn son was set to graduate on July 22 and was travelling to Kenyatta University to collect his graduation gown when he met his death. Oliver Muinde, the 25-year-old, left his parents' home in Kasevi village, Mwingi Central, a happy man little did he know it was his last time to see his parents, relatives and friends. His father said his death is a big blow to the family as he was the firstborn of the family and was very outgoing, hardworking and a devoted Christian. "He had started teaching in one of my schools and was doing well. We looked forward to his big day as he graduated but instead our family celebrating his success, we are mourning,"  he said. Oliver was among the 6 people, 4 women and 2 men, who were burnt beyond recognition following the accident. The 14-seater matatu they were traveling in collided with a personal car at Kwa Majini Bridge and it burst into flames. The fire is said to have been caused by a gas cylinder which exploded. Mutukaa called on matatu SACCOs to avoid carrying gas cylinders to avert such accidents. "I call on the government to conduct a thorough search to ensure PSVs stop carrying gas cylinders as it poses a major risk to passengers like what happened at Kwa Majini bridge," he said. Mutukaa has also urged the contractor in charge of constructing the bridge to hasten the process to curb accident incidents.
