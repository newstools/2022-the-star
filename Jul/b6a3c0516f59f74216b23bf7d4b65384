An MCA candidate in Emuhaya, Vihiga county, is using a handcart to hunt for votes across the ward. Aggrey Alukoye is eyeing to unseat incumbent MCA Paul Tiira of ANC. He said he will ensure equal service delivery to all people across Central ward. ​Alukoye is seeking votes on The Service Party of Kenya under Kenya Kwanza alliance.​ As the MCA takes is ferried on a handcart, his competitors with hefty financial muscle have mounted serious vote hunting strategies. “The current office has ignored us, they don’t value us. We are also part of this ward. We vote, we elect them but it’s like once we have elected them our business ends there,” Alukoye said. He said this time he has decided to try his luck in politics so that he can fight for those who are undermined. The MCA candidate says he resolved to take his campaigns on handcart in a door-to-door mission to urge locals to vote for him. Alukoye will be among the 41 MCA candidates in Emuhaya on the ballot on August 9. “I have no money to campaign but I am just asking my people to elect me and I will serve them with dignity,” he cited. Incumbent MCA Tiira said he has done his best with the allocations. “I can’t go beyond what I have but those who I haven’t reached in terms of service delivery I will in my second term,” Tiira said. The MCA spoke to the Star on the phone over the weekend. He said they are in a political season and all candidates have the right to say what they want to please their supporters.
