President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday revealed that some people wanted him to send soldiers to stop ODM leader Raila Odinga's mock swearing in. Speaking Friday at State House in a meeting with religious leaders, Uhuru said he stood firm and refused to bow to the pressure. "When things were bad and some people went to swear themselves in, there are those who wanted me to send my soldiers but I stood firm and said no," he said. The president said his aim was to ensure peace prevailed and he achieved that goal despite stiff opposition to his resolve. "I let them be and there was peace. I still reached out to them so we could talk. There was a lot of opposition to the talks by the chest thumping team and even after I pleaded with them, they made it their job to always attack me," Uhuru added. On January 30,2018, Raila was sworn in as 'the peoples president' in a ceremony held at Uhuru Park. The oath was administered by lawyer TJ Kajwang and Miguna Miguna. During the oath taking, which took one minute and 15 seconds, the State switched off TVs, Radios and social media in a bid to block the public from witnessing it. On March 9, 2018, Uhuru and Raila reached a truce over their political differences accentuated by the disputed 2017 presidential election results. The two sealed their new-born friendship by holding a handshake on the steps of Harambee House, catching many, including their close allies by surprise. The handshake marked the ceasefire to political hostilities that were threatening to throw the country into violent abyss. Both Uhuru and Raila have consistently held that find the common ground was for the interest of moving the country forward economically and politically. Deputy President William Ruto and his allies have however blamed the handshake for derailing the Jubilee administrations development agenda in its second term.
