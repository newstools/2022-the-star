Kenya girls yesterday defeated Uganda 18-16 to win Wednesday’s 3x3 U-23 Nations League Africa South tournament Stop One at the Nyayo  Stadium handball courts. It was sweet revenge for the host, who had lost their two consecutive matches to their neighbours. Coach Tony Ochieng attributed the win to mental strength. “I am impressed with the way we played today. We showed our mental toughness and denied them the inside drives thus limiting their options to outside shooting,” said a happy Ochieng. The tactician shuffled his side, replacing Lavender Akinyi with Jackline Kogo, a move that seemed to have ignited the hosts as it paid huge dividends. Earlier Kenya had posted an easy 22-10 win over Botswana in a game that saw Okot score nine points with Alexandria Adala nailing nine. Okot, who remains Kenyans' main source for points managed to register a game-high of 13 points in an easy 21-10 win over Benin. Kenya boys, who missed the finals for the third day running beat  Uganda 20-18. They, however,  went down  19-11 to Rwanda in a game that saw Martin Buluma connect for five while Patrick Ngabonziza collected eight. In their other game, they beat Benin 18-13 as Dolph Otieno made eight points and the losers Tacfic Andabi scored his side’s seven. Other results saw Rwanda beat Botswana 18-10 in the final of the day. It was their second appearance after a win over Uganda the previous day. Botswana produced their best game of the tournament as they stunned Uganda 17-15 while Rwanda blanked Benin 16-11 in another game. Women's games saw Uganda blank Rwanda 14-10, Benin hit Botswana and Rwanda 12-9 and 15-13.
