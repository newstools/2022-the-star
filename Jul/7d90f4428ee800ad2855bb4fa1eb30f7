Sarina Wiegman described England as “really ready to go” on the eve of the team kicking off their bid for home European Championship glory. The Lionesses take on Austria at a sold-out Old Trafford on Wednesday in the opening match of this month’s showpiece. Wiegman’s side have beaten Belgium 3-0 at Molineux, Holland – who she oversaw winning Euro 2017 on home soil – 5-1 at Elland Road, and Switzerland 4-0 in Zurich in warm-up matches in the past few weeks.
