Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Saturday thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for their support in his bid for the Mombasa Governor seat. In a message that announced his defection to the Kenya Kwanza camp, Sonko said the two leaders supported him in his hour of need. "I will not leave without gratitude to His Excellency Kalonzo Musyoka who has stood with me all along with the same ambition of helping the people of Mombasa," he said in a Facebook post. "I also pass my gratitude to His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta who has been like a brother to me and supported me and I wish him nothing but the very best of luck in his future endeavours." Sonko said his decision to decamp was not a selfish act, as he only wants the best for the Mombasa residents. "Time is not on our side and I have had to sit down as a leader, think about what would be best for my people and I have come to the realization that I should work with a government that shares the same vision for my people as I and one that benefits them," the post read. Sonko added that he will not be leaving his Mombasa governor running mate Ali Mbogo in the Raila Odinga coalition. "He has been put to suffering by those fighting me, and therefore from the positions offered I will also consider him." The leader promised to keep peace and calm during his campaigns in the Alliance. Upon his reception, Sonko said he has been offered 7 positions for himself and his people, if Ruto wins the August 9, general elections. The DP has promised the ex-governor one Cabinet Secretary, three principal secretaries and four ambassadorial posts if he wins the August 9, polls. In Nairobi, Sakaja will offer Sonko, two CECs positions and three chief officers. Omar on the other hand has offered Sonko three CECs positions, and three chief officers.
