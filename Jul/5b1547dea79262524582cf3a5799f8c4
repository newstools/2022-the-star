@alalmaurice Residents in Kisumu have petitioned the Kenya National Highway Authority to erect bumps along Nairobi road to reduce accidents. Under the umbrella of Kisumu City Residents Voice, they want KeNHA director general Kung’u Ndung’u to urgently ensure bumps are erected directly opposite the Jubilee market. Led by human rights and social justice defender Audi Ogada, the residents said the Zebra crossing directly opposite the market is now a black spot with accidents being reported daily. “Being a matter of public interest, KeNHA should intervene and save the lives of citizens who normally find themselves, victims of notorious drivers and riders,” Ogada said. In his open public administrative petition dated July 13, he said in one week, more than eight accidents have been witnessed. He said, despite several pleas by members of the public, no action had been taken. “It is disheartening to note that many pedestrians including children have been knocked down several times yet no tangible measures have been put in place to reduce this carnage,” Ogada said. The activists appealed to the authority and other relevant agencies to come up with an immediate and effective approach to deal with the matter. Ogada said the best strategy was to erect a hump and put clear signage (s) and speed limits from the Museum area to Kisumu Boys roundabout and  Kamas area. “We believe that this will end these accidents,” he said. Ogada copied the letter to Governor Anyang' Nyong’o, Nyanza regional traffic commander Mwangi Ng’ang’a and the regional public works officer. Mwangi said stern action will be taken against the speeding and reckless motorists. On Tuesday, he said an accident was reported along Kisumu-Nairobi road at Nyamasaria area at 1030 hours.
