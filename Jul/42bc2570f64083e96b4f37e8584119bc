Three people were Wednesday killed and seven others injured when a matatu collided with a lorry at Kipturgut, Mulot on the Narok- Kisii highway. Police and ambulance responders said the seven who were injured are in hospital with serious injuries but in stable condition. Witnesses and police said the accident happened when the matatu driver tried to avoid hitting a motorcycle that was ahead of him before losing control of the vehicle. The driver is said to have collided with an oncoming lorry and rolled into a ditch. The matatu had ten people on board and was headed from Narok route to Bomet when the accident happened at about 8 pm. Police say they are investigating the incident. Those who died on the spot were a woman and two men. The driver of the lorry and his passenger escaped unhurt, while the boda boda rider fled the scene on the motorcycle. The injured were rushed to Longisa County Referral Hospital while the bodies of the deceased were taken to the same facility's mortuary pending identification. Relatives and friends of the victims flocked the facility overnight and Thursday after the news went out. The wreckage of the matatu and the slightly damaged lorry were towed to Ololulunga Police Station pending inspection. Road users along that route have repeatedly complained of the recklessness of the boda boda riders, which has caused dozens of accidents. More than 3,ooo people are annually killed in accidents in the country. Speeding, according to police, has been the main cause of the crashes. Reckless driving, dangerous overtaking, drunk driving, drunk walking, drunk riding, and failure to use helmets among other issues have also been attributed to the increase in crashes. The National Transport and Safety Authority says they have developed comprehensive, highly publicized road safety awareness campaigns and programmes among pedestrians, bodaboda riders, drivers of public service vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles aimed at behaviour change.
