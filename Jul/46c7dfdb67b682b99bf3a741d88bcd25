Machakos Wiper governor candidate Wavinya Ndeti has welcomed the endorsement of the incumbent governor Alfred Mutua. In a statement on her Facebook on Sunday, Wavinya said she is confident that her team will win the next coming polls. "I graciously accept the valuable endorsement by the outgoing governor Dr Alfred Mutua and treasure his public commitment to vote for me. It's a big plus for us and goes a long way to demonstrate confidence that only our team has what it takes to steer the County," she said. "Getting all sons and daughters of the soil rallying behind my candidature is a true testament of our clarion call. Indeed we are winning big." Mutua had on Saturday called on Machakos residents to support Wavinya in her bid to win the governor's seat. He was speaking during a Kenya Kwanza rally in Machakos. "I want to announce to the Kamba community that I have worked for you for ten years. I am now leaving you as the Machakos governor. I want to tell you who I will leave you with as your next governor. ," Mutua said. "My vote I will give to Wavinya Ndeti because she is the one who can bring development to Machakos County. I defeated Wavinya Ndeti several times. I will vote for Deputy President William Ruto as my fifth President, Rita Ndunge (woman representative) and Wavinya Ndeti as my governor. " Ndeti will battle for the seat with CCU party leader Nzioka Waita, UDA national chairman Johnson Muthama and ELP party leader Rose Mulwa.
