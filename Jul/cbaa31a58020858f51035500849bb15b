Kenya has come a long way in its effort to foster a thriving democracy. Unlike some of our neighbours, we have a long tradition of holding elections every five years as our Constitution stipulates. The democracy we are proud of, though not perfect, is the result of many years of toil, blood and sweat. That tree of democracy is still in its formative stages, after only 59 years, and needs to be watered until it turns into a mature oak. That is why it was very shocking to learn that Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga had pulled out of the much-awaited debate set for today. Raila has been on the front line of major democratic initiatives in the past 30 years ever since he was elected MP for Lang’ata in 1992. The presidential debate is a young institution that he must help develop by participating in today's, alongside his main rival William Ruto. The debate is only 10 years old, having first taken place in 2013. Raila has held countless public meetings espousing his agenda. The debate is the best platform on which to reach a large number of voters to market his plans. The avenue will give him time to challenge the proposals of his rivals and elucidate his own. Running away from the debate is not an option.
