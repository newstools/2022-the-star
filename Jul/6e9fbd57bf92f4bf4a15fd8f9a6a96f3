Fireworks are expected as the national men's volleyball league playoffs take center stage today at Nyayo gymnasium. The three-day four-team tournament promises thrills with some mouth-watering clashes on the card. Defending Champions the General Service Unit commence their title defence against familiar foes Kenya Prisons in the morning with matches played on a round-robin format. The afternoon paves way for Trail Blazers to settle scores with Kenya Ports Authority who have had a faultless season despite finishing second in the 16-team league. GSU will be back in action on Saturday. Their resilience will be tested as new kids on the block Trail Blazers who have nothing to lose try to derail the paramilitary side's push for a fifth straight title. KPA, on the other hand, will make amends against Kenya Prisons after the coastal side crumbled to a 3-0 loss in the regular season to David Lung'aho's Prisons. A battle of the titans will be witnessed on Sunday as KPA hope to pull a trigger and disarm GSU for a second consecutive time. KPA humiliated GSU in straight sets in the sixth leg and stakeholders predict a new champion might be crowned should the disciplined force fail to match their last season's standards. Kenya Prisons will entertain Trail Blazers. Trail Blazers will rely on Jean Claude Masezerano, Moses Sialo, David Neeke and Julliard Mbappe as the Ruaraka-based side give a shot at the title in their first season. Elphas Makuto is the player to watch for Kenya Prisons as the Warders aim to reclaim the title they last won five years ago. In Dennis Omollo, Enock Mogeni, Peter Kamara and Elijah Bosire, KPA are a modest outfit capable of tormenting their rivals on their day. Abiud Chirchir who has missed the majority of the season because of a professional stint in France could be the missing link in Gideon Tarus's GSU.
