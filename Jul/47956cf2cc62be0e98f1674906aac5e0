The Kenya Water Institute is set to construct a Sh1.7 billion Kyuso campus in Mwingi North, Kitui. The school project is in partnership with Mwingi North CDF. MP Paul Nzengu said the Kitui government has donated 12 acres for its construction. He spoke during a public participation exercise conducted in Kyuso market last week. "Working with KEWI on the Water committee at the National Assembly led to the proposal of Kyuso campus," Nzengu said. He said the campus will give learners the knowledge to address the acute water shortage. The legislator said he has channelled Sh10 million to consultancy and is waiting on some donations to construct the administration block. "My aim is that Mwingi North becomes a benchmarking subcounty in the country," he said. KEWI director Kennedy Riaga said Kenya is a water-scarce country but they are working towards increasing access through expansion of facilities. "We already have a campus in Kitui but we decided to construct Kyuso campus for wider reach," he said. Riaga also urged residents to donate more land as the institution needs 30 acres.
