A letter indicating that it is from the ODM leader Raila Odinga's Presidential campaign secretariat spokesperson Makau Mutua to the head of presidential debates secretariat Clifford Machoka is fake. The letter had listed numerous demands purportedly made by Raila before gracing the 2022 presidential debate scheduled for Tuesday, July 26. The letter dated July 22 had a 'signature' and the name of Makau. Pesacheck has however established that the letter is misleading as it was not authored by Makau. Raila's communication team told Pesacheck that the letter is not authentic. Also, scanning through Makau's official and verified social media handles shows he has not shared such a document as would be a procedure. The same can be told about Raila's and Azimio-One Kenya Alliance's official social media handles. The content of the fake letter has widely been shared by a section of Kenyans on social media, therefore, Kenyans are asked to disregard it. Such documents can be verified by checking the official media handles of the ODM leader or his key officials.
