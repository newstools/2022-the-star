Kenya Airways has suspended the sale of tickets from London to Nairobi as per directions from Heathrow Airport. According to Business Daily, the suspension follows a directive by Heathrow Airport, instructing airliners to freeze outbound bookings until September. The move is to control passenger flow through the airport amidst a catastrophic manpower shortage. The carrier's top executive  says it may also see the national carriers cancel some flights to the UK in line with the new requirements by Heathrow. KQ managing director Allan Kilavuka said that they would not make new bookings going forward until the ban is lifted but will fly passengers who had made earlier reservations. "They have asked us to close new sales from London which means we should only fly the tickets already sold up to now," said Kilavuka. Heathrow has capped the number of passengers who can depart from the airport to 100,000 daily to manage travellers at the security checks and minimise delays. On July 15, Emirates rejected Heathrow Airport's demands for airlines to stop selling summer tickets, calling the move "unreasonable and unacceptable". The airline accused the airport of having a "blatant disregard" for customers after it capped passenger numbers to 100,000 per day over summer. Emirates said the airport now faced "an 'airmageddon' situation due to their incompetence and non-action". Heathrow said it had no choice but to bring in a cap on departing travellers.
