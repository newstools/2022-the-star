The mother of a class 8 pupil at Nyamninia primary school in Yala township ward, Siaya county, has broken her silence on the ordeal of her firstborn son who was severely beaten, allegedly by teachers. This is after a video emerged online on Wednesday sparking uproar and a call for action among Kenyans. Nereah, the mother, explained her disappointment with the teachers for going overboard in disciplining her son. "As a parent, it is very painful. There are ways of disciplining a child but not the way mine was beaten, that is not punishment. He still has injuries," Nereah said. She said the boy was contemplating dropping out of school or even worse, ending his life as he cannot take the punishment anymore. "His father took him to the hospital and the doctor advised him to take a p3 form from the police to start investigations but we are yet to receive communication from the area chief," she added. Some of the pupils who were canned together were interrogated by the ministry of education officials and the police. Nyanza region education director Nelson Sifuna, confirmed that the boy was among the top ten best candidates who were punished to better their results. Sifuna said the boy is now back in class and the matter is under investigation with hopes that the culprits will be prosecuted. Early learning and basic education PS Julius Jwan said police have launched investigations on the matter. Jwan questioned the motives behind punishing the student in such a 'cruel' manner. "It is extremely cruel for a trained teacher to punish a learner. I don't think any normal teacher would punish a learner like that," Jwan said. The Ministry of Education banned corporal punishment in schools in 2001. The act is unlawful under the Constitution and is prohibited in the Basic Education Act, 2013. But the behaviour is still persistent in some schools.
