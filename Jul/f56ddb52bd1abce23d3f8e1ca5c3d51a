Tens of thousands of people are expected in the coastal city of Durban this weekend for the annual Durban July, billed as Africa's biggest horse-racing event. But many are really there for the fashion and the glamour. Saturday featured a fashion contest to show off the latest creations by local designers. This year's event was keenly anticipated because it had been held behind closed doors for the past two years due to the Covid pandemic. Among the local celebrities attending was actress Jessica Nkosi. Of course, some people were also there for the racing.
