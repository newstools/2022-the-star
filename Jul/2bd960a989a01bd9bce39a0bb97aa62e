University of Nairobi “Terrorists” tactician Eugene Genga is concerned about his team’s fitness level after their 57-47 loss to Africa Nazarene University in a Kenya National Basketball League match over the weekend. The campus lads, who are now on a three-match winless streak, led 30-28 at the break before collapsing to the Wolfpacks in the last quarter. “Our fitness levels have dipped. I also feel the early losses have taken a toll on the boys, mentally,” Genga said. “Our execution down the stretch was abysmal. We weren’t able to adjust to Anu 1-3-1 zone defence and this took us out of our rhythm.” He said the campus lads Will regroup and plan ahead as there is no time for excuses. “When I look back, we had some good plays but finishing off the game was the challenge, and our opponents capitalised on our mistakes in the fourth quarter,” said Genga. Anu coach Mike Oluoch said they started badly and struggled in the first three quarters because they were not following instructions. He went on: “When they eventually followed orders... in the last quarter... we managed to take the game.” “I am taking one game at a time since each opponent is different. If we get one or two more wins in the first leg, we will be fine.” ANU, who face Lakeside in their next fixture, are placed second behind leaders Ulinzi Warriors. Both teams are tied on nine points from five matches. Terrorists are tenth with three points.
