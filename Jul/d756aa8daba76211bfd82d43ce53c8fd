The late social media influencer and blogger Frank Obegi was buried on Tuesday this past week at his rural home in Bogwendo village, with his funeral witnessing some drama. In a video seen by the Star and posted on cyprineoenga's TikTok page, a man can be seen begging to speak to the assembled mourners attending the funeral. The man who seems to be very emotional and in deep pain (and maybe a bit tipsy) can be heard begging the organisers to speak to the people assembled. "Apana. Lazima watu wanisikie, Lazima wanisikie! Nipe microphone. Lazima watu wanisikie," before video then cuts out. From the comments section, some Kenyans claimed that the man who was demanding to speak was actually the late Frank's brother, while others alleged that he was the best friend who wanted to tell his truth.
