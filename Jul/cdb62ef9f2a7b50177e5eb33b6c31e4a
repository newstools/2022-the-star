Nyakach MP Joshua Aduma has been charged afresh with conspiring to defraud the Nairobi City County of Sh10 million three years ago. The corruption charge arises out of work he did for the defunct city council of Nairobi as director of legal services. It is alleged that he conferred a benefit of Sh10 million paid in legal fees to Stephen Mburu (deceased) a partner with the law firm which represented City Hall in a case. The law firm according to the charge sheet is Wachira, Mburu, Mwangi and Company advocates. The offence is said to have been committed between the 3rd and 10th of June, 2011. Aduma was charged alongside Paul Mutunga, Manaseh Karanja, Peterson Njiru and Charity Ndiritu all former employees of the county. They denied the charges before Anti-corruption magistrate Victor Wakumile and were each released on a personal bond of Sh10 million. According to the charge sheet, Mutunga being a councillor with the county unlawfully acquired Sh1.4 million from Mburu. The monies were part of the Sh10 million unlawfully paid to the said law firm by the city county. In 2020, the prosecution had sought to have Aduma’s matter consolidated with another similar one facing former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero. But Anti-corruption magistrate Douglas Ogoti declined. Ogoti said a careful analysis of both files showed that both have charges of conspiracy to commit an offence of corruption and in both charge sheets it’s evident that there were two transactions and the only common denominator being lawyer Mburu (deceased). In the Kidero one, he has been charged alongside the former chief of staff George Wainaina Njogu, former Nairobi mayor John Ndirangu Kariuki and former councillor Paul Mutunga Mutungi with conspiring to defraud the county of Sh58 million.
