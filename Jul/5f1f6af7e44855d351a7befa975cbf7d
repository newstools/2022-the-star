Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has hit back at  UDA presidential candidate William Ruto over comments on her marriageability. Ngilu in response to the DP's remarks faulted him for disrespecting women saying his fate will be sealed on August 9. "If you cannot respect women, you cannot respect anybody else- Because it is from women you come. William Ruto you can insult women all you want. But in this election, women will make  major statement," she tweeted. Earlier, during campaigns in Kitui, Ruto made comments about Ngilu that were perceived to be condescending. "Kwani mama mzee hivi anaweza kuolewa? Ataolewa na nani? (Can such an old woman be married? Who will marry her)?" the DP asked. He was campaigning for the UDA Kitui governor candidate Jonathan Mueke when he seemingly attacked Ngilu. "Na ule mama(seemingly Ngilu) alienda aje (Where did that woman go to)?" the DP posed to the crowd. It is then that a section of the crowd shouted: "Alienda Bondo (She went to Bondo)". The DP then posed: " Aliendaje Bondo, mlikataza yeye kura( How did she go to Bondo, did you deny her votes)?" Ruto's question is in reference to Ngilu's move to quit the governor race. A person in the crowd shouted: "Aliolewa Bondo (She was married in Bondo)". The comment prompted Ruto's remarks.
