Two others are fighting for their lives in hospital after the probox car they were riding in lost control and rolled several times at Riobonyo area near Nyangusu. Kisii sub-county traffic commander said the driver of the probox was speeding. “The driver was speeding and lost control. He knocked a pedestrian and a motorcycle. Five people were injured and one person died on the spot,” he said. He said police have received information that two of the injured people died.
