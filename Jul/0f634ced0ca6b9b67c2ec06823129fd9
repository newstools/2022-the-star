Men's suits are mostly worn on official occasions. To break the monotony, one can wear a hat. This will make the look classier; it can also double as a smart casual look. However, not all hats go with a suit, only four designs do: Flat cap Also known as new boy or hipster, the flat cap was seen to give 'old man' vibes but it is currently the most worn hat. It can be worn with a three-piece suit and the look finished off with black leather casual boots. The look is casual but still suitable for evening functions such as dinner or a night out. Fedora Fedoras are mostly made of shouting colours such as pink, purple and maroon. They help to tone down the 'serious' look of a suit, from official to a bit casual. The light colour palette and plaid print will always stand out in a sea of black tuxedos. The suit is formal, but pairing it with a fedora makes one look approachable, laid back and warm. Large brim Fedora The difference between a normal fedora and a large brim is the extension on the sides. The roles performed are similar but the suitability differs with the shape of one's face. Homburg hat The Homburg is made of wool and fur. It is commonly known as Godfather hat. This mostly goes well with a cowboy look but if wearing a suit, go for a pin-striped one. Even though this hat is not an everyday choice, the one time it is perfectly matched, it doesn't go wrong. Bowler/derby For a more classic look, pair your bowler hat with a business suit, lounge suit, or stroller suit then wear it in a formal and business setting. You can also pair a bowler hat with a classic overcoat. Rest the brim of the bowler cap evenly on your head for a classic look and place it evenly on top of the head.
