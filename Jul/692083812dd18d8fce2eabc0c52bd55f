Motivated by Deaflympics bronze medallist Isaac Makokha, five junior golfers with hearing challenges were among the junior golfers who took part in the Safaricom Golf Tour held at the par 73 Nakuru Golf Club over the weekend. The five were drawn from Ngala School for the Deaf in Nakuru County and played in the tournament won by Lynette Zawadi and John Mbagi. Six-year-old Lynette from Nyali golf club produced a splendid 37 gross to claim the overall title with Nakuru-based Mbagi emerging the best boy after posting a gross of 84 points. “It feels nice to be the overall champion even though I didn’t play to my potential," said Mbagi. "I had a tough time at the front nine given the cold weather in the morning, but my back nine was good with solid putting and good drives. "I believe golf is for everyone and I want to thank Safaricom for giving young people this opportunity. My ambition is to become a professional and represent my country,” added Mbagi. Sunday’s tournament witnessed the largest turnout for the junior part of the tour with 159 participants. On Saturday, during the corporate day tournament, 17-year-old Kelvin Kiplenge from Nakuru beat a field of 246 golfers to claim the overall title on 41 Stableford points. Kiplenge became the second junior golfer to win the corporate tournament after 15-year-old Leo Gitonga won the second leg of the tour in Limuru. The victory also earned Kiplenge a place in the series grand finale to be held in Vipingo early in August. The Safaricom Golf Tour now moves to Nairobi, with Kenya Airforce Golf Club set to host the next leg on July 16. The tour has so far drawn over 5,000 golfers — who have participated in the tournaments, junior clinics and outreach programmes.
