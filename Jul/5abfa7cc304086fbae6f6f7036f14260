Turkana has opened a geospatial information system laboratory to facilitate evidence-informed decision-making in the county government. Public Service executive Jeremiah Namuya said the lab has placed Turkana on the country’s map as one of the foremost counties with such installations alongside Vihiga and Wajir. The county partnered with USAID-Nawiri to deliver the facility. USAID-Nawiri chief of party Hussein Noor Abdille said the opening had been preceded by an assessment of the existing county monitoring and evaluation system. Thereafter, a data systems adviser was seconded to train and provide continuous mentorship to focal persons on the use of the facility. “We have supported capacity building of the critical staff from different departments of the county government, some of whom benefitted from learning visits to Wajir,” Noor said. A GIS map plotter, printing services and programmed computer systems are some of the inputs within the laboratory to allow for the generation of diverse outputs. The event was attended by the Turkana office staff and the USAID Bureau of Human Assistance project team. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
