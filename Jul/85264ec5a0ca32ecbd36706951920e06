Education CS George Magoha has castigated the Kenyatta University administration for the ongoing land row. Magoha, while breaking ground for Competency-based Curriculum (CBC) classrooms at Pumwani boys, said all land belongs to the government. He added that even if the government was interested in a public school's landfor investment purposes, the relevant stakeholders should let it go. "All land belongs to the government. The government owns everything, including the land I am standing on," Magoha said. He clarified that being in the position of Kenyatta University Vice-Chancellor Paul Wainaina, he would have resigned. "If I don't like what you are telling me to do, the door is wide open, I will use the legs that God gave me and I will leave," Magoha said. This comes after claims that Wainaina resigned on Tuesday. However, there's no clarification or written documents from the institution showing that Wainaina resigned. Magoha's remarks come after Kenya University council members declined a request that compelled them to hand over the institution's title deeds. According to a statement by the council and signed by the council chair Migot Adhola, the title deeds will not be submitted to Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua. "We wish to inform you most respectfully, that we will be unable to accede to the request to the title deeds," the statement reads. This letter was a response to a previous direction from Kinyua, requesting the varsity to hand over a section of its vast land. According to the letters from Kinyua, 30 acres will go to the WHO emergency hub while some will be donated to squatters. Another 10 acres will be donated to the Africa Centres for Disease Control. Kinyua said 180 acres will go to the neighbouring Kenyatta University Teaching Research and Referral Hospital, which already sits on 100 acres donated by the university ten years ago.
