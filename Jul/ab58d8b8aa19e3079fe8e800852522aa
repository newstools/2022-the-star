@robertomollo3 More than 3,000 farmers in Homa Bay on Thursday received Sh4.7 million equipment to help them grow sorghum and raise poultry and fish. They received the equipment from the government through the Agriculture Sector Development Support Programme II (ASDSP II). The items distributed included threshers for preparing sorghum after harvesting, cooling boxes with vaccines for vaccinating poultry and pond liners for reducing drainage of water in fish ponds. Farmers who benefited are organized in groups. Homa Bay chief officer for Agriculture Samuel Owigo  presided over distribution of the items said they want to enhance efficiency in crop production. The official said the threshers will make it easier for farmers to prepare their sorghum after harvesting. “Vaccination of chickens will cushion farmers from losses resulting from deaths of the poultry. This will help in preventing diseases affecting the livestock,” Owigo said. Speaking during distribution of the equipment, Owigo said the programme is aimed at enhancing food security. This will be achieved through promotion of sorghum, fish and rearing chicken. Owigo said the ASDSP II will improve the livelihoods of many famers. “I urge residents of Homa Bay to increase food production. Any agricultural activity undertaken today has economic value,” he said. Farmers who received the items expressed optimism that their production capacity will increase. Sorghum farmers Lazarus Owade and poultry farmerAgnes Obiny urged  the country government to continue standing with them. Owade, who acquired a thresher, said the equipment will cushion them from post-harvest losses. “We always incur-post harvesting losses but this thresher will salvage the situation,” Owade said. Obiny said availability of vaccines would enable her poultry to stay healthy and disease-free. “We’re ready to collaborate with extension officers to ensure our animals are treated and we increase production,” she said.
