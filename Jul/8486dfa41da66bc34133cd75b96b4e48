@magatinews Villagers in Nyakeyo, South Mugirango, want security agencies in the region to unravel the mystery surrounding the death and subsequent disappearance of a granny killed at Getonto village three weeks ago. Only a hand of Yunis Bitengo, 71, was discovered during a search on a maize farm, a kilometre away from her house. The disappearance of the woman's body sparked anger and protests on  Tuesday after residents accused the police of inaction. Family members said they want justice for the deceased. They want Vigilance House to deploy homicide detectives to help hunt the possible killers. Three suspects who had earlier been arrested have been released after preliminary investigations failed to place them at the scene. Moses Abuya, Bitengo's son, said his mother had visited some brewer's den for a drink but failed to return sparking anxiety. Also recovered from the scene were keys, scarf and the wig she was wearing at the time she went missing. Omae Nyabuto, a son-in-law to the deceased, said while the matter has been reported to police in Etago, investigations are yet to gather pace. “We want to see arrests and the body discovered to give her a decent burial and swift justice,” he said. Josephat Onderi, a relative, asked Interior CS Fred Matiang'i to help unravel the mystery surrounding the incident. “We want him to pressure his men to act. It is anarchy and reckless to lose an innocent life in such a manner,” he said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
