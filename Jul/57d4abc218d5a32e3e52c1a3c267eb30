UDA presidential candidate William Ruto has hit out at President Uhuru Kenyatta for subsidising the price of maize flour. Speaking during campaigns in the Gikomba area, Ruto, without mentioning names, took a swipe at Uhuru for blaming the Ukraine-Russia war for the high cost of living. "Ati bei ya unga imeenda juu kwa sababu ya vita kule Ukraine? Si vita inaendelea bado Ukraine? Si leo wamesema watateremsha bei ya unga? Kumaanisha ile walikuwa wanatuambia eti mambo ya Ukraine ilikuwa tu ni kutuhadaa," he said. The comments come months after President Uhuru said the high cost of living had been largely contributed by external factors, including the Ukraine-Russia war. An internal communication document signed by Agriculture PS Francis Owino on Monday said the Ministry of agriculture shall subsidise the price of maize flour being produced and sold by millers for a period of four weeks. The flour will now retail at Sh100, a drop by Sh130. "The recommended retail price of flour is should not exceed Sh100 for a 2kg packet, Sh250 for a 5kg packet and Sh490 for a 10kg packet," the document read. Ruto claimed that the State had lowered the prices as a move to manipulate voters ahead of the August 9, general elections. "We will take the unga but we are going to vote with a plan to make sure that every Kenyan has food," he said. "Kenyans have already decided… whether you lower the prices or not you will go home on August 9." During his campaigns, Ruto blamed the 2018 handshake between Uhuru and Raila for the high cost of living. “In 2018, the 2kg packet of maize flour cost Sh75. It is now selling at Sh250 and we are told that after I was elbowed out, [it] is the Azimio guy,” he said during a campaign tour in Kilifi on June 26.
