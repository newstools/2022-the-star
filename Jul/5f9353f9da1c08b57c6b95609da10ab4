The youth in Kakamega have been advised to take an active role in politics by voting during the August 9 general election. Maskani ya Taifa programmes officer Teresa Loch also advised the youth to use social media for advocacy and countering fake news. Speaking in Kakamega during an engagement forum with the youth on elections and voter apathy, Loch said that it is important for youth to participate in voting to elect leaders who will push their interests. “As youth we should not take a back seat during the general election since these matters affect us and we are the voice of change,” she said. She said they have trained members in Maskani Hubs across the country to become peace ambassadors and activists. “We are committing to spread the message of peace and also to empower other people on how to use social media wisely to protect themselves and the community they live in,” Loch said.
