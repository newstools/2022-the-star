The Embu county clergy have urged politicians to maintain agenda-based campaigns and avoid making their opponents the subject during rallies. Speaking in Embu town during the National Council of Churches of Kenya meeting, the Embu county chairman Njeru Nyaga urged the leaders to preach to Kenyans about what is in their manifestos. Nyaga said the exchange of words and name-calling among politicians is a disgrace to the nation. Bishop Nyaga called on Kenyans to promote peaceful coexistence and tolerance. "We have been brothers long before the elections were ever discovered. We must not allow any politician to break that bond as they seek their political goals," the bishop said. The NCCK Embu county secretary Bishop Stephen Njogu urged politicians to avoid attacking their opponents based on their personal life and instead concentrate on their agenda. He said personal background, race, religion, tribe, or marital status should not be on the agenda because everyone is entitled to enjoy the above as a Kenyan. Embu West subcounty deputy county commissioner Mercy Gatobu urged the political class to maintain peaceful campaigns to ensure the electoral process is peaceful. She further urged everyone to ensure they practice their constitutional mandate during and after election. The meeting brought together the county clergy, security agencies and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
