Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has cancelled all rallies scheduled for Tuesday. This is according to a Facebook post by the UDA digital strategist Dennis Itumbi. This is to give him enough time to prepare for the presidential debates taking place at the Catholic University for Eastern Africa (CUEA). "Ruto cancels all rallies scheduled for Tomorrow, Tuesday, 26th July, 2022.To enable him prepare for the Presidential Debate," the post reads. The UDA leader was expected to sell his agenda to the residents of Baring, Nakuru and Nyandarua counties. Speaking during a campaign trail in Uasin Gishu-Nandi counties on Monday, Ruto also begged his Azimio opponent Raila Odinga to show up for the debate. "I want to encourage my competitor, Mr Kitendawili, reconsider coming for the debate, I will be waiting for you," he said. Ruto said if Raila does not have an agenda to tell the electorates, he should at least tell them the meaning of the phrases he uses during campaigns. "Even if you do not have any policies or plans, please come to the debate because Kenyans want to know what this 'tibim' and 'tialala' is. They want to know what these folklores of yours mean." His remarks come after the Azimio spokesperson Makau Mutua on Sunday hinted that the former Prime Minister may not be attending the debate. He claimed the DP had schemed to make sure that there were no discussions regarding corruption and integrity, adding that those are the core issues in the Coalition's agenda. Mutua said Ruto had no regard for ethics, public morals or shame. "That is why we do not intend to share a national podium with a person who lacks decency. As is well known, our opponent traversed the country hurling epithets at us and other key national leaders, including vile, sexists attack," he said.
