All eyes were on triple Olympic champion Sifan Hassan but two-time world champion Hellen Obiri has proved her agility with silver in the much-anticipated race with Margaret Chelimo settling for bronze. Ethiopia-born Letersenbet Gidey ran away with gold in 30:09.94 while Obiri and Chelimo recorded their personal bests of 30:10.02 and 30:10.07 respectively. Hassan finished fourth timing 30:10.56. Obiri is set to start her title defence in 5,000m on July 21 with the heats at 2:25am before the final on July 24 at 4:25am. In an exciting race Great Britain's Eilish Mcolgan led for the majority of the race with Gidey, Obiri and Chelimo keeping tabs in a tense race which also included Ejgayehu Taye. The Ethiopian duo of Gidey and Taye tried to break away at one stage during the race but were reeled in by Obiri and Chelimo alongside Eritrea's Rahel Daniel with the lead changing hands between the Ethiopians.
