Former Sofapaka midfielder Wisdom Naya has passed away, aged 19. Naya succumbed to death after a long battle with cancerous soft tissue sarcoma. Kenyan Premier League club, Sofapaka, broke the news on their social media pages early Friday. “We are saddened to have lost our former midfielder Wisdom Naya. The youngster has passed on due to soft tissue, Sarcoma. Our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Naya,” the club said on Twitter. The teenager had his left leg amputated in January after five chemotherapy sessions at a local health facility proved futile. He traveled to India in December last year and returned to Kenya with his leg already lopped off. Trouble started after he sustained an injury during training and developed a painful swelling on his left knee. His situation drew the attention of many, with Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga contributing Sh500,000 toward his treatment. Other leaders who came to his rescue include Deputy President William Ruto, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi, Saboti MP Caleb Amisi and Tuwan MCA Benard Wambua. Naya rose to the limelight after inspiring St. Anthony’s Boys Kitale to the 2015 Copa Coca-Cola African Cup of Nations title after edging Nigeria 4-3 on post-penalties. His exploits earned him the tournament’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). Barely a month later, he landed a contract with Sofapaka.
