Candidates gunning for the Nairobi governor seat at the August 9 polls will on Monday be at the center of the storm when they face-off in a debate over their manifestos. The televised debate comes just a week before the deputy presidential debate on July 19 and two weeks before the presidential debate on July 26. The gubernatorial race has nine candidates, including Polycarp Igathe of the Jubilee party and Johnson Sakaja of United Democratic Alliance (UDA). Former journalist Denise Kodhi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Tech-entrepreneur Harman Grewal of Safina party and Kenneth Nyamwamu of the United Progressive Alliance and Cleophas Mutua Kiio of Ford Kenya party are also scheduled to face the panel. Independent candidates Esther Waringa, Nancy Wambui and businesswoman Agnes Kagure are also set to face the panel at the debate. All have been cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to vie for the position. Four Journalists picked by the Presidential Debate Secretariat will moderate the debate to be held at the Catholic University for Eastern Africa (CUEA) main campus in Karen, Nairobi. According to the secretariat, the debate will be held in two tiers; the first will run from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm and will feature governor hopefuls whose popularity ratings, based on three recent opinion polls, stand below 5 per cent. The second debate will air between 8:00 pm and end at 9:30 pm featuring candidates who have polled above 5 per cent in the same opinion polls. Serfine Achieng’ Ouma of KBC and K24 TV's Ayub Abdikadir will moderate the first-tier debate while Zubeida Koome of KTN and NTV's Mark Masai will moderate the second-tier. Members of the public had until midnight, July 9, 2022, to send in questions they would like answered by the candidates.
