The Kilifi governor candidate on Pamoja African Alliance  party George Kithi has called for the amendment of the Copyright Act of 2001. Kithi, also a city lawyer, said the Act should be amended to include minimum standards and payments for the performing artistes. Speaking in Kilifi on Saturday during a meeting with artistes, Kithi said the amendment will also curb undercutting. “We have great talents in the county, but our artistes are paid peanuts. We must have a law that will dictate the minimum amount an artiste should be paid. The law should also make it a criminal offence for someone to charge below that amount just like we have in the law profession,” he said. The governor hopeful also said once elected, he will make sure a law is enacted in Kilifi county to push the same. He said the county will also impose levies to artistes which they will pay every time they perform in the county. “I will tax them a certain amount so that they do not charge a small amount. This is not meant to punish artistes, but actually to push them to demand better pay from people who contract them. So it will be up to you,” he added. Kithi further said a law will be passed in the County Assembly to compel any artiste who is not from within and is invited to perform in the county, to include two artistes from the county to perform in the event. “We cannot have artistes from outside the country come and take money while our artistes are left with nothing. Every artiste from outside must have our artistes perform in their shows,” he said. The candidate also outlined his plans to establish a Talent Academy and a house of talent in Kilifi once elected. He said the academy will majorly focus on teaching artistes how to run talent as a business. Kilifi County PAA senator candidate Ben Kai said the levy will go to the yet-to-be-established Kilifi County Artistes Fund, which will be used for talents development in the county.
