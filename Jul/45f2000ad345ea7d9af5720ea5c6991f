Homa Bay governor candidate Gladys Wanga has accused his opponents of employing the services of goons to attack their rivals. Her statement on Friday followed an incident Thursday where a supporter was roughed up and left for dead by goons at Kotora Primary in East Gem Ward. Wanga said the hooligans were associated with political rivals in Rangwe constituency. "We are saddened that the attack led to the death of a young man known as Joakim Okoth Mbuya who was beaten to death by the political goons. "These goons have over the past few days been deployed by the opponent to terrorise our supporters." The Woman Rep said Mbuya's attackers were part of a rival's political convoy that was driving by when they descended on him with crude weapons. "No life should be lost because of a political contest, every life matters and everything must be done to curtail the sustained efforts by senseless goons to breed acts of violence within Homa Bay County," she said. Wanga further accused her opponents of hiring hecklers to shout down their rivals at various public events, a move she said is aimed at provoking them to violent reaction. "We want to appeal to the Homa Bay County Police Commander to act against the mushrooming incidents of sponsored political violence and investigate reports that some of this actors may be in possession of arms that should not be in the hands of civilians," she said. This is the second time Wanga is raising concern about the use of violence by some aspirants in HOma Bay county. On May 23, the Woman Rep said the violence appears to be well coordinated after goons attacked and injured nominated MCA Pamela Odira.
