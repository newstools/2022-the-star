Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has said he will continue fighting for the former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko to be on the ballot on August 9. Speaking during a wedding in Mombasa on Friday, Kalonzo said Sonko has a good plan for the City and is an able leader. "You know I've been struggling to have Governor Mike Sonko become Governor of Mombasa and I'm still on it... We are ready for any challenge," he said. The former Vice President added that Sonko was planning to work on providing clean and healthy drinking water for the Mombasa residents. "He has already spoken to the companies in Sweden. This is the time to do desalination out of the Indian Ocean and give our people good water." Kalonzo reiterated that the Wiper party will continue pressing for Sonko and his running mate Ali Bongo to be cleared. He also said  Mombasa needed leaders who would make the region and the port great and safe. Last week, the Mombasa High Court declined to issue conservatory orders to stop IEBC from proceeding with the gazettement and printing of ballot papers for the Mombasa governor race. Sonko had filed a petition seeking to restrain IEBC from gazetting the governor candidates and printing of ballot papers. He also wanted the Court to compel the Commission to give them copies of the degree of all the governor candidates who have been cleared to run in the country. The Court further ordered Wiper to nominate another candidate for the position. "The Party might pick Kisauni MP Ali Mbogo today to replace my bid," Sonko said on June 24. However, the party is yet to do so and is instead fighting for him.
