The government is buying and slaughtering livestock from drought-stricken farmers and distributing the meat to more than 200,000 hungry families in West Pokot. The programme will also reduce losses incurred by farmers during the drought. Speaking to the press on Wednesday in Kapenguria, West Pokot county commissioner Apollo Okello said the programme will reduce migration. “The programme will lessen the burden on farmers migrating in search of pastures and water since they will have fewer animals to maintain from available resources" he said. The worst-affected wards include Masol, Lomut, Lower Sekker, Endugh, Lower Kasei, Kiwawa, Alale, Kapchok, Kodich, Suam, Lower Riwo, Lower Chepareria and Lower Batei. Okello said currently the region is receiving long rains and livestock have enough pasture and water. “From October to December, this region shall be having average rains and farmers should be encouraged to destock their animals,” he said. Okello said the government intends to purchase more than 1,300 cattle for slaughter to provide relief to families and institutions. The government will purchase a cow for Sh15,000 and a sheep or goat for Sh3,000. “Payment will be made by the Kenyan Red Cross through mobile money transfer with 24 hours of purchase,” he said. The commissioner said the programme has been implemented in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross, the the state department of Livestock, West Pokot steering groups, the Ministries of Interior, Devolution and the National Drought Management Authority.
