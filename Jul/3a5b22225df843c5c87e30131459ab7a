Fredrick Leliman, a police officer, had a motive to kill Willy Kimani's client, Josephat Mwenda, a court has ruled. Justice Jessie Lessit said the court has noted that Leliman never denied ever meeting Mwenda and even shooting him a year before his murder. "I find that the first accused had a reason to silence the deceased because his job was on the line due to the case Mwenda lodged at IPOA," she said. "I find that the first accused (Leliman) is the only one among the five accused who had a motive to kill the Mwenda." The court has found that the police have proven beyond all measurable doubt that the Mwenda was indeed harassed by Fredrick Leliman the first accused and he deserved action from IPOA because he couldn’t ride his Boda Boda anymore after that. The judgement came six years after the gruesome murder of the rights lawyer. Willie, who was a lawyer working with International Justice Mission, was brutally murdered alongside his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri on June 23, 2016. Police officers Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and police informer Peter Ngugi have been charged with their murder. The three victims were abducted from their car as they left Mavoko law courts, where Willie had gone with Mwenda his client. Their bodies were later found dumped at the Oldonyo Sabuk River wrapped in black gunny bags.
