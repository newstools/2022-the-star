UDA secretary general Veronica Maina has maintained that Kenya Kwanza coalition will still hold their final rally at Nyayo Stadium on August 6. Maina who was addressing UDA supporters in Murang'a on Friday, said they had a valid contract for use of the venue. "On the issue of Nyayo stadium, we are holding our mega rally as Kenya Kwanza coalition, we have planned and have paid for it, we have a contract and we are not in agreement with the cancellation of that venue," she said. "We want to ask Sports Kenya to be neutral, to do the right thing, Nyayo stadium is a public resource, and every Kenyan has a right to use it, as long as you meet the terms and conditions, of hiring that venue." On July 21, Sports Kenya wrote to the UDA party, saying that Nyayo National Stadium will not be available for their scheduled rally on August 6. According to the letter, there will be peace concerts that will take place in the Stadium from August 5. "We regret to inform you that due to peace concert scheduled to take place at both Moi International Sport Center- Kasarani and Nyayo National Stadium between August 5 to 7 2022. The facility will not be available for their use," the letter said. Ruto’s main rival and Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga also plans to hold his last rally at the Nyayo Stadium. Azimio secretary general Junet Mohammed, on Tuesday, July 19, announced that Raila will have his last rally at Nyayo Stadium. However, Kenya Kwanza's head of presidential campaign Josephat Nanok said they will be moving to court to challenge the decision to lock them out of Nyayo Stadium. Nanok asked their opponents to find an alternative venue noting they were the first to book Nyayo stadium on July 9.
