Kenya girls on Saturday won the 2022 FIBA 3x3 Under-23 Nations League Africa South title after beating Uganda 15-12 in the finals match played at the Nyayo Stadium. "I am happy we have qualified. We were prepared mentally. We moved the ball a lot but we had problems scoring under the rim. In the last three minutes, we scored only one point," said Kenya coach Tony Ochieng. Babra Achieng managed to score six points while Medina Okot bagged another five points for Kenya. The Ugandans were led by Shakira Nanvubya who bagged six baskets while Mary Amaniyo managed five. "We feel good. Today we said we must win this one and we did. I realised that number five (Mary Maniyo) was giving us problems and I decided to take care of her. We are happy to lead in Africa," Opined Kenya captain Achieng. Kenya men on the other hand went down 19-17 to Botswana in a hard fought game and finished third behind the winners Rwanda and Uganda. Other results saw Uganda pip Rwanda 21-20 in a tight duel while in the women match, Rwanda lost to Benin 14-10.
