Kiss FM's breakfast presenter Kamene Goro has turned down Stivo Simple Boy's offer to love her. In an interview on Kiss TV with Oga Obinna, the 'Mihadarati' hitmaker said Kamene is his celebrity crush. Speaking during the breakfast show, Kamene said she is Stivo's big fan but rejected the idea of dating him. She said the singer is not her type as he is short. "Maybe he was my type back in the day, but for now, no, I like them very tall nowadays," Kamene said. "I woke up in the morning and my phone was just buzzing out of control. I opened WhatsApp and I had been tagged in different groups. I was like 'who died?' Then I saw Stevo Simple Boy has professed his love for Kamene." Kamene is currently in a happy relationship with someone else.
