Tana River voters have been urged to elect visionary leaders with unquestionable integrity for the county to develop, with only 34 days remaining before the general election. Muslim for Human Rights, with support from USAID in a programme dubbed Kenya Electoral Conflicts Mitigation and Civic/Voter Education Support, conducted a community dialogue forum in Hola. “Today we are here in Hola to hold a meeting with young people and women as well as the IEBC to inspire young people and women so that they can elect moral leaders who will run this county peacefully,” Ogle Muhuri field officer Ogle Abdi said. “We also aim to sensitise the youth to maintain peace and security especially as elections approach. "We lost many people in 2012 while in 2017 some rumours and riots contributed to conflict and chaos.” Abdi encouraged the youth to maintain peace and elect leaders with integrity and not look at issues of ethnicity, religion, race and even friendship. While speaking at the same function, Pastor Richard Osoro of Pentecostal Assembly of God church said religious leaders are at the forefront in preaching peace to the congregants. “As we come to approach the election, we educate worshippers to choose the best leaders who will focus on peace and those who care about the interests of the people,” Osoro said. “We have emphasised and continue to insist on peace for Kenyans to stick together so that Kenya can be more peaceful. "We have been praying that the election will be peaceful and I have high hopes that it is peace and development that we want in Kenya.”  (edited by Amol Awuor)
