Former Kisii senator Chris Obure says the Jubilee team seeking county leadership is the best and appealed to residents to vote for them. “We have what it takes. We have the experience, education and networks for having worked in various capacities in the government and private sector,” Obure said. The former senator spoke in Kisii town on Thursday after a tour of the town. He was accompanied by his running mate William Mbaka, senator candidate Omingo Magara and Woman Representative candidate Peris Onsarigo. They asked voters not to gamble with their votes with inexperienced candidates who don’t have a track record. “Our administration will be anchored on partnerships, consultations and public participation,” Obure said when he met matatu operators, boda boda riders, mama mboga and taxi operators, among other groups. The former Cabinet minister pledged to create a favourable environment for them to do business. “We shall also look at the taxes and see if they are productive or counterproductive,” he said. Obure also promised to improve infrastructure in Kisii town if elected as the county’s second governor on August 9, even as he decried the deplorable state of infrastructure in the congested town. “The state of roads and drainage in this town are in bad shape. Provision of piped water and construction of public toilets are top on my priority list,” he said. Magara and Onsarigo called for peace as the campaigns hit the homestretch. They also asked voters to reject candidates who perpetuate violence. Obure is one of the leading governor candidates together with ODM’s Simba Arati, UDA’s Ezekiel Machogu and DAP-K’s Sam Ongeri. On Thursday, Tifa Research released an opinion poll showing that 66 per cent of voters in Kisii would vote for Arati while his closest challenger Nyaribari Masaba MP Machogu would be voted by 11 percent. Only three percent of the respondents said they preferred Chris Obure for the top county job.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
