World Under-20 walk race champion Heristone Wanyonyi is seeking to kill two birds with one stone as the global show in Cali, Colombia fast approaches. In an interview, Wanyonyi said he is not only hoping to defend his title but also to attain his personal best if not break the junior world record. The junior world record stands at 37:44 and Wanyonyi believes he can conquer the world. He said the training in the past few weeks has been effective and he has learned new tactics. He said he had learned a few things from the World Athletics Race Walking Team Championships held in March in Muscat, Oman. During the national trials held at Nyayo National Stadium earlier this month, Wanyonyi won the race in 43:16.1 to earn a direct ticket to the global show. “I am not only going to Cali to defend my title but also to try and improve my personal best and hopefully break the world record. My personal best is 42.10 and if I can put in more effort, I am sure I can break it.” Wanyonyi is also aware of the tough competition that awaits him but said he is ready to face his opponents. He, however, admitted that being the sole representative from Kenya puts him under pressure. “Japan, China and India are our biggest threats but we will see how it goes. The three countries have strong and experienced walkers. I know I will be a lone ranger but I will give it my best shot,” Wanyonyi said. Overall, he said the team is in high spirits and will defend their crown. “I have faith we will bring back the victory and more medals,” he concluded.
