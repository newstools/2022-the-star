Deputy president William Ruto on Saturday unveiled his six-wheeled truck branded with the United Democratic Alliance party colours. Ruto who shared the pictures on social media, appreciated the artist behind the truck. “Indeed Every Hustle Matters. Pimp My Ride: Creativity at its best. Thank you for your contribution to the Hustler Nation Campaign,” Ruto said. The truck which was splendidly done had the images of Ruto and his running mate Rigathi Gachagua splashed all over it. The Photographs of the multi-million truck first emerged on social media last week. But today it was the DP himself who shared the pictures. In the pictures seen by the Star, Ruto was seen riding in the machine as he took several pictures with it. Its not clear how much the six-wheeled truck can cost. But it could go up to about Sh10m and above. Ruto who is also a candidate for the August presidential elections has been selling his hustler nation narrative. In his manifesto, he emphasises on empowering the economically underprivileged through what he calls the bottom-up economic model. The DP pledged to transform two million poor farmers from food-deficit to surplus producers through input finance and intensive agricultural extension support. “We commit to revamping underperforming or collapsed export crops, while expanding emerging ones such as coffee and boost the tea value chain,” he said in his manifesto. To economically empower “hustlers”, Ruto also promised to provide Sh50 billion per year to fund small businesses and start-ups.
