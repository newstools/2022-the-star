A senior police officer was arrested after his juniors claimed he could not account for a pistol they handed to him as an exhibit. The Officer Commanding Station, Laare in Meru County, Ezra Sambu was detained following the disappearance of a firearm exhibit. Two police officers had earlier on Thursday arrested a suspect identified as Dancun Murangi from whom they recovered a pistol. They said they informed the OCS who joined them and took over the firearm exhibit. The suspect was booked at the Station vide Ob No. 05/20/07/2022 as a suspect of robbery with violence under the instructions of the OCS but the issue of the firearm exhibit was not mentioned anywhere. It had apparently gone missing between the town and the station. It is not clear what happened during the period, the police said. The matter was brought to the attention of the Deputy Sub County Police Commander who informed his seniors before the DCI took over the case in which the OCS denied having received any firearm. Police said a search was conducted at his house where a total of Sh220,100 and a toy pistol were recovered. A further search was conducted in the OCS office and armoury but the same was not found. The arresting officers and the OCS recorded their statements. The arrested suspect was too questioned and recorded a statement as part of the probe into the matter. The OCS was detained at Meru Police Station ahead of his planned arraignment with the offences of conspiracy to defeat justice and compounding a felony under the Penal Code, police said. Sambu is a former sprinter who specialized in the 400 metres. His personal best time is 44.43 seconds, achieved in July 2003 in Nairobi. We could not get his comment on his side of the story because he was still in custody. Police in Meru said they are still investigating the matter. Such cases are common in the service. Police argue they have internal mechanisms to address them.
