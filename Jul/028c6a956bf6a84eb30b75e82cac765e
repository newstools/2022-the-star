Kenya's mixed 4x100m relay team booked a place in the finals of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games after finishing second in their heat at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre on Friday. The quartet of Emily Muteti, Ridhwan Bwana, Imala Bella Thorpe and Maina Monyo glided to a 3:45.36 finish, behind Singapore in the opening heat that featured three teams. Kenya’s time ranked eighth overall, just enough to see the quartet through. The Kenyan swimmers, however, faired miserably in individual races where none of them went past the first hurdle. Even though Bella Thorpe won her heat in the women’s 100m butterfly in 1:02.16, her time wasn’t fast enough to sweep her through. Muteti fizzled out to trail the shoal after clocking a disappointing 1:02.10. In the men’s 50m butterfly, Ridhwan finished fifth in 25.92secs, placing 34th best overall.
