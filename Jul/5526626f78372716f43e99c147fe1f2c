Reigning National Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) rugby 15's champions Kakamega High School have started preparations in earnest ahead of next week's school games. Last week, the Ministry of Education released the co-curricular calendar for sports in schools for both secondary and primary schools with the national championships set for September 8-13 in Nakuru. The Term Two Games will feature soccer, volleyball, netball, basketball, hockey, handball, rugby 7’s swimming, and racquet games. However, 15’s rugby and soccer Under-16 will not be held while the 3x3 basketball format has been introduced. With no rugby 15's on the calendar, the kakamega-based school will now have to adjust to the 7s. Kakamega High School head coach Edward Butala Wambi said the school culture has been built around 15s, which has been their main game. “In the absence of 15's, we will have to adjust to the Sevens' game. We have begun our training and we are looking forward to a better game at the pitch,” said Butala. He, however, warned that adjusting to the 7s game will take a long time e but assured that they will use the available expertise to ensure the boys perform. Batala lamented that the congested calendar will offer little time to prepare now that they are starting the games after two years due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Actually, we have been out of training and we are going to have it rough because we have a very short period to prepare,” he said. The school has a rich history in rugby with the likes of national team players —Alvin Otieno, Eliakim Musonye, Eugene Sifuna, Derrick Ashiundu, and Ephraim Oduor among their products. “We are rich in talent and we have players turning up for the national teams (both in the 7s and 15s)," he added.
