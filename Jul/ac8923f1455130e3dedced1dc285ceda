After guiding Trail Blazers to the playoffs on their debut in the national volleyball league, setter Jean-Claude Masezerano is eager to go one step better and help the newbies win their first-ever title. The Rwandese import, 22, is the engine of the team considering his role and is eager to upset the form-book and make history with the Ruaraka-based side and book an African Club Championship slot. “It is my first time taking a team to the playoffs as a key player and that is not a mean feat. We have met with all the teams that will be in the last four of the competition and It’s only Kenya Prisons that humiliated us 3-0,” said Masezerano. “We narrowly lost to both General Service Unit and Kenya Ports Authority on five-set thrillers because of minor mistakes but we are ready to make amends.” “Everyone is itching to play at the African Club competition and we are going all out to claim that slot. I believe cordination and teamwork will work better for us since our burning desire to lay hands on the prestigious gong is stronger than ever,” he added. The Kigali-born player only started playing volleyball in 2016 while in Form 5 as basketball was his first love. Masezerano turned up for  Equity in 2019, plied trade with  APR of Rwanda in 2020, re-joined Equity in 2021 before severing ties with the bankers in favour of the Richard Sylvain-led Trail Blazers project in November the same year. Masezerano wanted to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a professional volleyball player and the Trail Blazers have offered him that platform. The decision to quit basketball for volleyball was because he wanted to follow in the footsteps of his brothers who have made it in life through volleyball. Meanwhile, the playoffs are set for July 22-24 in a yet-to-be-decided venue where Trail Blazers will battle leaders GSU, KPA and Kenya Prisons in a round-robin tournament.
