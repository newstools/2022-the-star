Cancer specialist Dr Anselmy Onyango Opiyo, who died last Sunday aged 65, has been fondly remembered for his exuberant warmth. When Rosemary Silayo was diagnosed with stage four cervical cancer last December, her family hoped for a saviour. She was referred to Nairobi Hospital, where the family met Dr Opiyo, a senior radiation oncologist. Humphrey Roco, the eldest son of Rosemary, said “the doctor was different" from the others they had encountered during the treatment of their mother. While the treatments needed to save her life were mostly expensive, he said the oncologist relayed the information with “warmth...so much so that he would allow local arrangements to enable the procedures go on without putting cash on the table first.” “You go to his office and you find hope to keep trying that next procedure, or fork out that money to get that next drug. He gave hope to cancer patients in a dynamic way.” Dr Opiyo had previously served as head of the Cancer Treatment Centre at the Kenyatta National Hospital, and chief consultant and head of CTC at the Coast General Hospital. Roco says Opiyo made the treatment journey of their mother a fairly  light load and whenever they had an appointment with him, the mother would cheer up. The doctor is survived by his wife Anita and children Joseph and Madeleine. He will be buried on Saturday, July 23, at his family home in Kaugagi, Alego, Siaya county. His family and colleagues celebrated him as a hard working medic who went for the heart, and not just mind, of his patient when treating them. They say he personalised care, made patients comfortable and perhaps forgot their pain for a moment. "He was a great professional who made humanity of medicine come out in a unique way during the treatment journey. We will miss him," Joy Kanyweru, one of his former colleagues, said. A funeral mass to celebrate his life was held on Thursday at Don Bosco Catholic Church, Upper Hill.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
