Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen has weighed in on Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga's hint on missing the presidential debate set for July 26. The senator said Raila should concede defeat, instead of looking for reasons to miss the debate. He claimed that considering how Rigathi Gachagua performed in the presidential running mate debate, Raila cannot match Deputy President William Ruto. "Considering that Rigathi Gachagua obliterated Martha Karua- the Deputy Project, we can all understand why the Project is unable to face the Deputy President William Samoei Ruto. This game is over. Azimio should just concede defeat instead of fighting IEBC," Murkomen said in a tweet on Sunday. On Sunday morning, Azimio la Umoja spokesperson Makau Mutua hinted that Raila might not attend the presidential debate. The coalition noted that having Ruto and Raila on the same platform this year would be a bad idea. Mutua claimed Ruto had issued his reservations telling the moderators not to focus on corruption and integrity- issues which Azimio wanted to take centre stage. “Our opponent has no regard for ethics, public morals or shame, that is why he has demanded that the debate not focus on corruption, integrity, ethic and governance- the key existential question that Kenya faces. These issues sit at the core of the Azimio campaign. Any debate devoid of these questions will be an insult to the intelligence of Kenyans,” he said.
