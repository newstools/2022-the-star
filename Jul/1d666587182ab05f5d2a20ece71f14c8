So it was all about completing the melody and making it rhyme." He said the song has "a lot of English". "That had me play a lot with how I was executing the melodies. Let's say it was a new challenge to me," Iman said. The song has also made him him realise the importance of transitioning in music and being diverse in the music industry.
