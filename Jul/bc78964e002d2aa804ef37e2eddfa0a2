UDA presidential running mate Rigathi Gachagua now says his life is in danger. Gachagua claims some people have been trailing his movements citing a case of Nakuru where he had pitched tents for campaigns. The UDA presidential running mate, however, said he will not be cowed and will keep pushing for their presidential bid. "The reason I am saying my life is in danger is that some people have been following me, a recent case being in Nakuru. But I am not afraid, I am ready to pay the ultimate price," he said while on a campaign trail in Nyeri county. According to Gachagua, President Uhuru held a secret meeting during which he said he will teach him, MPs Moses Kuria (Gatundu South) and Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) a lesson. The Mathira MP has now asked the President to consider retiring in peace now that his term is coming to an end. Gachagua who is in the company of Kenya Kwanza leaders exuded confidence that they will win the August 9, polls.
