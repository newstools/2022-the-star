ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna now says if the Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto is elected president, he will leave the country. Sifuna claimed Ruto is not fit to be a leader owing to his temper issues. "Mimi nakuhakikishia Ruto akichanguliwa kama rais, hata huyu Sifuna nitatafuta nchi ya ng'ambo ya kujificha," he told NTV. This loosely translates to, "I assure you if Ruto is elected the president, I Sifuna will leave the country and go abroad to hide". The Nairobi senatorial aspirant urged Kenyans to restrain from voting for a leader whose bid is driven by revenge. "We must weigh in on the candidates. You should not vote for someone who is clearly looking to carry out revenge... I want to assure Kenyans, if you vote for an unworthy leader, we will all suffer." Weighing in on the ongoing verbal fight between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Ruto, Sifuna said the Deputy President was only angry at his boss for breaking his vow to endorse him. "You remember the reports that Uhuru was to support Ruto to get 10 years after his tenure. People disagree. In friendships and marriages. Relationships dissolve. Wewe ukiachwa  achika!" He said it was regrettable that Ruto thought the best way to stop Uhuru from stepping down was to almost slap him. "The position of the presidency is a symbol of national unity. Not subject to be taken lightly and have threats made concerning the person who holds it," he said. Sifuna further claimed that Ruto's threat was fuelled by his need to stay in power. "What Ruto was talking about is that he couldn't let governance go. His reasoning was that the President tried suggesting the 2017 presidential result annulment was too much to deal with, and that they should move on," he said.
