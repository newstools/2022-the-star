Para-athlete Nelly Sile feels her inclusion in the team to the Commonwealth Games later this month in Birmingham is a miracle. “My selection in this team is like a miracle. I never expected to be on the Commonwealth Games team. The experience in camp is good and I’m focused on training because at times we suffer in non-residential training. Commuting daily is not easy at all,” said Nelly at her training base at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. She said the facilities being offered at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani including a well-equipped gym are sufficient to prepare for the games. “We usually have a lot of challenges with training venues. At times, you have the money but there are no facilities available,” she added. This will be Sile’s first major championship since taking up para-sports. She said: “I have really wished for the big championships, but I have never participated in any. I now see this as a blessing from God and will ensure I work hard to be on the podium.” So far so good, and Sile revealed that she has seen a lot of improvement in her performance. “I have a very good coach and whenever I need help, she is always there. This camp has come through very well because we are learning every day. There are things we didn’t know because disabilities are different,” she observed. Sile will be taking part in the F55 category of shot put in athletics field events and has set the bar higher with a podium target.
