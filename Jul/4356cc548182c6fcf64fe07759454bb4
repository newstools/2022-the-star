Gospel musician Pitson has been ordained to serve as a reverend. The veteran singer shared the news of his new path on social media with a video of him being prayed for accompanied by his pregnant wife and children. "What does it mean, dear Lord, to be now called a Reverend? Teach me, reveal to me," he wrote. "Plant me in the nations and reap the universe for You." Pitson grew up as a pastor's child. "I was in this group where the mantra was 'Purity is Power'. While we're together, we had an unwritten agreement not to have sex with our girlfriends," he said. Pitson later shared how he almost lost his marriage for keeping mistresses and sponsoring their lifestyles. He now hopes he will inspire more generations through his talent and his new job title.
