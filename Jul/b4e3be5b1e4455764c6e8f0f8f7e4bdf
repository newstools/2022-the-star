Sometimes you just want to be online, but stay incognito. Perhaps, hiding from your friend, boss, or due to various reasons best known to you. The good news is, that WhatsApp is finally working to fix that for you. According to WABetaInfo, the company is developing a new feature that will let users hide their online status from selected contacts. Before, users were only allowed to hide their last seen status completely from nobody, all contacts, or everybody. Now users can select contacts that can see if they are online on both iOS, desktop beta, and android. The feature is still under development and may roll out soon.
