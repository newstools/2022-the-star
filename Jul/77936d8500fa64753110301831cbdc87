Murang'a County senator Irungu Kang'ata has weighed in on Usawa Kwa Wote party leader Mwangi Wa Iria's move of joining the Azimio coalition. Kang'ata said the move will not make a difference or affect the Mt.Kenya voting patterns, especially in Murang'a county. Speaking at Kanyenyaini Primary School on Friday, Kang'ata said he is confident that Murang'a is UDA presidential candidate William Ruto's stronghold. "Muranga, Kangema and Kanyenyaini people, we have declared that Wa Iria joined Azimio alone, we did not follow him to the coalition, Murang'a cannot join Azimio, it is in UDA to stay," he said. Kang'ata went on to drum up support for Ruto, saying he is the perfect presidential candidate who will look into the farming and education sectors if elected in August. "We have a reason to support Ruto. He has promised to look into matters of education and tea farming," he added. Kang'ata urged Murang'a residents to vote for Ruto in August. Mwangi Wa Iria joined the Azimio coalition on July 19. He revealed that Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga agreed to infuse his Usawa manifesto with the Azimio one. Wa Iria said, together with Raila, they will implement his one cow, one household program if Azimio forms the next government. "I told Raila that if we combined his Sh6,000 pledge and my cow programme then we will take Kenyan families above the poverty line. I told him that those have to be in our joint manifesto and we did a deal. He stated that will happen," he said.
