Azimio Presidential candidate Raila Odinga has pledged to help transform agriculture in the county and settle squatters on  Agricultural Development Corporation ADC land. The former Premier said this during a campaign rally at Kenyatta stadium in Kitale. He promised that his administration will bring down the cost of farm inputs such as fertilizer to help farmers scale up their activities. He said his government will provide subsidies and drop the fertilizer prices from the current Sh7,000 to Sh2,000. " The Azimio One Kenya government will provide support to farmers to increase production. We will provide subsidies and reduce the cost of fertilizer," he said. To liberate Kenyans from hunger, he said that his administration will bring to end the frustration that the Kenyan farmer has been passing through. He pledged to push for more reforms in the agriculture sector and make it profitable for farmers. "I hereby make a pledge to the people of Trans Nzoia who have been struggling to produce food for this country that we will reform the sector to make it more productive," he said. Responding to concerns from Trans Nzoia Azimio's governor candidate George Natembeya, Odinga said his administration will axe 10,000 acres from ADC to settle squatters in the area. Natembeya asked  Odinga to consider settling several families in the county when he ascends to power. Other concerns raised by Natembeya were the high cost of farm inputs and poor roads that have hampered agricultural activities. The bad road network, Natembeya said hinders the transportation of produce from farms to the market. Odinga asked Kenyans to support his bid in the August 9 polls.
