All roads lead to the Nakuru Athletic Club as home side Nakuru RFC hosts the penultimate edition of the national Sevens series, the Prinsloo Sevens, this weekend. The tournament, which starts with the age-grade competition on Friday morning, has attracted over 40 clubs. The organisers on Thursday received a Sh2m sponsorship boost from Kenya Breweries, an amount the tournament director Eddy Moseti expects to go a long way in ensuring a successful event. “As stakeholders of the sport, and part of the hosts of the Sevens series, we are indeed glad to have this sponsorship from KBL. This will ensure the proper organisation of the tournament," said Moseti. "KBL has for a long time been a major partner of this tournament and we are delighted to have them on board once again. With corporate sponsorships like KBL’s guaranteeing the game’s growth, the potential to dominate the sport on a global stage in the near future is realistic." Tusker Trademark Marketing Manager Jean Okech said: “We are delighted to once again celebrate a sport that has put Kenya on the global map and has earned us huge fame and admiration from the rest of the world." "Our continued investment in the sport is tied to a noble ambition to support the development of the sport and encourage even more people to watch and play the sport," he added. "We are cognizant of the importance of corporate sponsorship and involvement in Kenyan sport and that is why we commit to continue supporting sports in the country."
