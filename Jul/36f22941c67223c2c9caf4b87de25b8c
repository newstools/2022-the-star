WhatsApp has announced that it is working on a feature that will let users see the previous and current members of groupchats. All group members will be able to view who left the group in the past 60 days, by opening a new section that will be available right within group info. WhatsApp says past participants will be removed from the list after 60 days. “Thanks to this new option, it will be easier to keep track of who left a WhatsApp group. Unfortunately, it seems that this list will be visible to everyone in the group, not only to group admins,” WABetaInfo reported. WhatsApp says the feature is still under development, and the way the feature works may change before the release. They plan to roll it out on Android, iOS, and WhatsApp beta versions soon. Currently, it is also working on the ability to silently leave groups without notifying other group participants with the exception of admins. It now says that with the new feature, all group members will still be able to see who leaves the group by using a feature called “past participants”. The release date of the feature is yet to be confirmed.
