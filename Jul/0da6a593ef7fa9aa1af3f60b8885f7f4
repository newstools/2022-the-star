Nairobi City Stars overall team skipper Calvin Masawa has revealed his disappointment with the team’s performance last season. “It was disappointing that we did not achieve our set targets. But this being a transitional season in our team, I can say we did a good job,” added Masawa. He, however, added: “The just ended season was an improved one in terms of points and goals because we managed to surpass our last season tally. It’s not always easy when a new coach is coming in. "But we are glad we found a good youthful coach (Nicholas Muyoti) who blended from the onset with the group of players he found at the club.” Masawa said he is looking forward to an improved 2022/2023 season. “We are now looking forward to the new season and I am pretty sure we are going to do better than last season,” he noted. Masawa has been in 'Simba wa Nairobi' books since his arrival back in the year 2011 from Migori Youth. However, he regrets not having done better than fifth place albeit being the club’s best finish in 14 top flight seasons with the club’s preseason target having been top three. To finish fifth, two places better than last season, City Stars scored 42 goals and summed up the season with 49 points compared to 34 goals and 45 points managed last season. In the ended season, Masawa clocked 14 games and captained the side eleven times. He clocked 1,199 minutes which was an improvement from the 93 minutes earned from three games in the 2020/21 FKF Premier League season. He was named MVP in the season-ending match against FC Talanta in a match that ended 2-2 at Kasarani Annex on June 12.
