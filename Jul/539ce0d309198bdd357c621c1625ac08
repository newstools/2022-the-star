Pork chops are extremely flavourful and can be served on their own or with just about anything. In this recipe, you can use either boneless pork chops or ribs but remember that thicker pork chops will take longer to cook. Make sure to grill your pork chops until they are no longer pink in the middle. Ingredients Preparation: Step 1 Preheat your grill to medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Step 2 Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze. Step 3 Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Step 4 Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, around 7 to 9 minutes per side. Serve with mashed potatoes, fries, or rice and enjoy with friends and family.
