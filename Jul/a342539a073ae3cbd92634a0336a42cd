Saku MP Dido Ali Raso has intensified his campaigns as he seeks to defend his seat in the August polls. The MP, who is vying on UDA ticket, has been crisscrossing the constituency in a bid to consolidate voters to support his bid for a third time. In his campaign team, Raso has brought on board youth, women, elders and professionals who have been selling his agenda. The second term MP has reiterated his plans to continue with the empowerment program in schools should he win the upcoming election. Raso said he has fairly distributed bursaries to needy and bright students and sponsored more than 150 students to various secondary schools. He notes that Saku constituency deserves leaders who care about the less fortunate in society and the residents have a choice to choose between a progressive and retrogressive leader. He urged the people of his constituency to shun ethnicity and urged voters to elect Kenya kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto. He appealed to his supporters to turn out in large numbers on August 9ls to exercise their democratic right. The UDA candidate will face off with his Dr Waqo Dulacha Ejersa of Jubilee, Adan Wario of UDM and Halkano Dida (independent), among others in August polls.
