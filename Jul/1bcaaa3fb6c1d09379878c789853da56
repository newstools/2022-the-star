The construction of the Sh13.4 million phase two of CBC classrooms in Mwala subcounty has begun. The Ministry of Education on Tuesday awarded tenders to contractors for 17 classrooms to be built in 10 secondary schools. Each classroom will cost Sh788,220. Mwala director of education Stephen Kitungu presided over the award of tenders at the deputy county commissioner's boardroom. He said construction works are expected to be complete by August 15. In phase two, seven schools have been allocated two classes each. They include Vulya Girls, St Paul Maweli, Miseleni Mixed, Ngamba, Ikalaasa, Kimuuni and Kilembwa secondary schools. The remaining three schools will each have one classroom. The director termed phase one of the project as successful, adding that the second phase will be completed on time. In the initial phase, the subcounty was allocated 45 classrooms and according to Kitungu, 43 are complete. "Plans are underway to have the other two classrooms in AIC Mithanga Secondary School and Kabaa High School fast tracked," he said. Kitungu urged the school administration and contractors to collaborate and ensure that the classes are completed within the stipulated standards and timelines. "The principals and the board should oversee the project and ensure that quality work is delivered within the given time," he said. The director said shoddy work by contractors will not be condoned and tasked the subcounty public works officer to ensure that the bill of quantities is followed to the letter. The classrooms are expected to ease the transition of CBC learners to junior secondary school in 2023. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
