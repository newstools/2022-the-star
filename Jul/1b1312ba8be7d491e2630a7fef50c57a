The Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday said former Nairobi governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko is a victim of a politically-motivated court and Senate. “It is not over yet because the matter is active in our Kenyan and the East African Court of Justice, of which Kenya is a member,” Kalonzo said. The Wiper leader was in the company of Sonko during the launch of Kitengela Municipality. He said the party is also suing IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati for being part of those who blocked Sonko from vying for the seat in Mombasa. “Those who think Sonko is a coward are mistaken. We have also taken Chebukati to court and all the legal aspects regarding the former governor are alive in the judiciary,” Kalonzo said. He claimed that Sonko was bundled out of office because of political interests in government and he was not accorded a fair hearing at all levels before he was kicked out. “I have confidence in Chebukati in delivering a credible election but sometimes you cannot understand him. He may be smiling and at the same time doing other things,” Kalonzo said. He promised residents of a resounding win for Raila in the presidential race against Deputy President William Ruto. He said if Azimio wins all the trained teachers in the country will be employed. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
