If you’re lucky to be heading abroad this summer, a visit to the famous canals in Venice, Italy might be on your itinerary, but beware of new fees to come. Venice will charge most of its visitors an entry fee from next year as it tries to tackle overcrowding. The city’s tourism chief says Venice are pioneers and will be the first city in the world to apply a measure that could be revolutionary. From mid January next year, day-trippers must book their visit online before travelling. They will pay a basic fee of 3 euro, which will rise to 10 euro at peak times.
