Housing Finance has introduced express services targetting affluent clients both in Kenya and abroad. This as the lender ups its customer retention antenna in the era where credit pricing is losing steam as a differentiating factor. In a statement, the lender said those customers will have access to exclusive banking services and a diverse range of banking solutions in select banking lounges. Speaking during the launch in Nairobi, HF Group MD Robert Kibaara said the service will boost the bank’s strategy to deliver exceptional customer experience and innovative solutions that match the changing needs of its customers. "The new service will see customers enjoy access to exclusive Ultimate Banking lounges in select branches as well as a broader and diverse range of banking solutions at preferential pricing,'' Kibaara said. He said that the product is designed to provide customers with superior banking solutions, services and advisory delivered by a team of dedicated relationship managers who understand their financial goals and aspirations. The banking initiative will also see the customers access personalised wealth management solutions. ''Achieving these banking needs will help build meaningful and lasting relationships with the targeted affluent customers,'' Kibaara said The lender is turning to customer service satisfaction as a lever to heightened competition in the banking sector. Reports show that efficiency is likely to retain clients more than price, discounts and loyalty programmes. According to a study by Live Person, 82 per cent of customers say the number one factor to great customer service is having their issues resolved quickly. Studies have shown that within a broad range – say 10-15 percent – customers won't switch because of a lower price. However, studies also show that as much as three-quarters of the customers who do switch do so because of inadequate service. HFC bank has a footprint of 22 branches across the country.
