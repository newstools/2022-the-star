Equity Bank Hawks slumped to their second consecutive Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) after going down 73-42 to champions Kenya Ports Authority at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium Sunday. The national team trio of Selina Okumu, Natalie Akinyi and Jemimah Knight ensured the porters made it a fruitful weekend. The Hawks were rushed 64-47 by a no-nonsense Maurice Obilo's sensational Zetech University Sparks who erupted from the start. "It was not a good weekend. A lesson learned from the defeats. We need to pick ourselves up and get back to our winning ways," offered bankers coach David Maina. "We had two tough games and you could see some tired legs in the second half of today's game. Hopefully, the players who were out with injuries will be back by the time we play our next game," he said. Captain Akinyi and Knight dropped 22 points while Okumu added another 12 points for KPA who also had a strong game from bankers' former centre, Belinda Okoth. On the other hand,  KPA's coach Anthony Ojukwu hailed his charges for the wins saying: "It was a good game. We really dictated the game, gave direction and communicated well on defence." He went on: "Our offence was well executed. Jemimah, Natalie and Belinda, really showed up in the game." Hawks new acquisition Joy Adongo was their only leading light in a sad weekend, sinking 11 points that included three treys. Faith Atieno scored 11 points as the University of Nairobi "Dynamites" embarrassed Storms 31-16 in a low-scoring encounter. The campus girls had a nightmare start to the season after they were humiliated 64-30 by a rampant KPA side
