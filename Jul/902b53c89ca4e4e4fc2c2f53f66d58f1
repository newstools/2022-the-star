Vanilla sponge cake is one of the easiest cakes to prepare. The secret to making a perfect sponge cake is beating your eggs for longer, to fluff them up with air. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat your oven to 180°C then proceed to prepare the batter. Step 2 Butter and line the base of an 8inch/20cm round deep cake pan then dust with flour to ensure the cake does not stick. Step 3 Sift together flour, baking powder and salt then place all ingredients into the bowl and mix. Step 4 Mix until your cake batter lightens in color and is thick and creamy. Step 5 Scrape the batter into your prepared baking pan. Step 6 Bake your batter for 35-45 minutes, until when a toothpick is inserted it comes out clean. Step 7 Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before turning out on a wire rack. Flip so that it is the right way up and allow to cool. Step 8 Dust with desiccated coconut or powdered sugar as desired.
