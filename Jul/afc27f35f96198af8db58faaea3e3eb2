Seven years after the murder of his son, the father of late Lawyer Willie Kimani is still smarting from the loss. Speaking after the High Court delivered its judgement on the five accused linked to the murder on Friday, the father, Paul Kinuthia, termed the verdict "good but not so good". “…I am still sad at the passing of my child..he died and left me alone…It has been seven years. It’s a good ruling but not soo good to me and my family,” he said. At the same time, Kinuthia thanked God that justice has finally been served adding that it's time to focus on other aspects of life. “He died and left me alone. Those who are locked should continue with their life as well.. what can we do? Let’s just thank God,” he said. Willie Kimani’s brother said he was happy with the ruling. “We are happy with the judgement and we thank God for the process. We have been here pressing on for justice and we are happy and thank the IJM fraternity,” he said. After six years of waiting, the High Court finally delivered its verdict on the murder of the lawyer, his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri. They were both abducted and brutally murdered in June 2016. Making the ruling on Friday, Lady Justice Jessie Lessit ruled that four - three police officers; Fredrick ole Leliman, Stephen Cheburet Morogo, Sylvia Wanjohi and their informant Peter Ngugi are all guilty of murder. One of the accused persons, police officer Leonard Maina was acquitted. Justice Lessit has analysed a total of 117 exhibits and evidence given by 46 prosecution witnesses and 34 defence witnesses to reach her decision. The judge had told the court that she had written more than 6,000 pages of proceedings since the trial started and it is the biggest file in her career.
