Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto has arrived for the presidential debate at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA). The UDA presidential candidate will have an opportunity to explain his agenda to the people of Kenya who will be following the debate live. "Today is an important day because we have come here to get a chance to speak to Kenyans. Kenyans need to know they will wake up on August 9 to go vote, they need to who they will be voting for and why," Ruto said. "We will have a chance to explain our manifesto, our agenda and important things that affect Kenyans and our country," he added. He said he will touch on the economy, hunger, how to reduce cost of living, job creation for youth, empowerment of farmers, health as well as education. The Presidential Debate Secretariat had scheduled the debate to be held in two tiers each featuring two presidential candidates. Ruto was to battle out with Azimio la Umoja One Kenya flag-bearer Raila Odinga in the second tier. However, Raila turned down an invite to debate Ruto. The UDA presidential candidate will have an opportunity to explain his agenda to the people of Kenya who will be following the debate live. Yvonne Okwara (Citizen TV), Eric Latiff (Spice FM) and Joe Ageyo (NTV) will moderate the debate.
