Cotu boss Francis Atwoli's ex-wife Roselinda Simiyu Atwoli has sought help from Deputy President William Ruto to pay her child's school fees. Roselinda claimed Atwoli has neglected them and her child hasn't been to school since the beginning of the year. "Kuna mtu mmoja ambaye wameacha mabibi hata mtoto. Mheshimiwa Ruto, I'm addressing you, naomba niko na mtoto ambaye tangu mwaka ianze hajawahi enda shuleni. "Najua Atwoli amekutukana, najua amekwambia matusi lakini on behalf of a mother, nisaidie mtoto aende shuleni," she said. This loosely translates to, "There is someone who has left his wife and child. Honourable Ruto, I'm addressing you, I have a child who hasn't been to school since the beginning of the year. I know Atwoli has abused you but for the sake of a mother, help take my child to school." Roselinda was speaking on Monday during the Kenya Kwanza rally at Naitiri in Bungoma county. In late January, the long-serving trade unionist disowned Roselinda after she defected to Ruto's United Democratic Alliance (UDA) camp. Atwoli, a staunch supporter of Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, dismissed her defection as inconsequential. “Roselinda was surrendered to William Ruto in 2007 in his Eldoret townhouse. She is no longer on the list of my relatives. Ruto can now add her, free of charge," Atwoli said in a tweet. Roselinda is seeking the Bungoma Woman Rep seat in this year’s elections. She was on April 25 issued a nomination certificate to fly the ANC party’s flag in the August 9 general election.
