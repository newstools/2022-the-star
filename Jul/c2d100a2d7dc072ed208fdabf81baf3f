Agano Party presidential running mate Ruth Mucheru Mutua has claimed that opinion polls are sponsored. Speaking during a deputy president debate on Tuesday at CUEA, Mutua backed claims that the polls are unreliable. "They have even refused to give us our own mark. In school, even the student with zero gets back their paper and a score card. But these sponsored research institutes have been removing this one kid," she said. She further claimed that their numbers have been reduced because they are a threat. "Probably we could be a threat. Because Kenyans are tired, they want new leadership," she added. In the past opinion poll results, the results have been compared between Raila Odinga's Azimio, William Ruto's Kenya Kwanza and George Wajackoyah's Roots party. On Sunday, Agano's presidential candidate David Mwaure warned Kenyans against believing the polls, saying they are manipulated. He further urged the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to remain firm in its duty to facilitate a free, fair and transparent election on August 9.
