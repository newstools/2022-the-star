Justice Jessie Lessit has explained why the note that Willy Kimani wrote before his murder was genuine. Before he was killed, Kimani during his arrest at the police station wrote a message on a toilet paper, saying his life was in danger. While delivering her ruling on Friday, Lessit said that the note that Willie gave to the construction workers who were passing by the police post where they were being held confirms that the confession was true. “This is because police informant Ngugi had confessed that the victims were taken to the Syokimau police post,” she said. The critical three-ply tissue paper note is believed to be the last note Kimani wrote before he, his client, Josephat Mwendwa, and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were brutally murdered on the night of June 23 last year. Willie, who was a lawyer working with International Justice Mission, was brutally murdered alongside his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri on June 23, 2016. Police officers Fredrick Leliman, Stephen Cheburet, Sylvia Wanjiku, Leonard Mwangi and police informer Peter Ngugi have been charged with their murder. The three victims were abducted from their car as they left Mavoko law courts, where Willie had gone with Mwenda his client. Their bodies were later found dumped at the Oldonyo Sabuk River wrapped in black gunny bags. According to police, after their abduction, they were held for a few hours at the Syokimau police post before they were taken to a field where they were killed one after the other. The prosecution had asked the court to convict all the accused persons saying they each played a part in the murder. The state told the court they have proved beyond all reasonable doubt that all the five accused planned the brutal killing of the victims.
