Teacher delocalisation will no longer be a thing under the Kenya Kwanza administration should DP William Ruto win the August 9 polls. UDA running mate Rigathi Gachagua said on Friday the programme has broken families and will be done away with if the DP ascends to power. "You teachers have complained for so long over delocalisation which was on you and broke families. Once we enter office on August 9, we will finish it and have every teacher posted where they were employed," Gachugua said. He spoke on Friday during Kenya Kwanza campaign at Kimende in Lari, Kiambu county. The Kenya National Union of Teachers and the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education teachers have consistently opposed the delocalisation policy on grounds that it was breaking families. The unions also argue that local teachers are better placed to to teacher in the regions whose demography and challenges they are familiar with. Rigathi also said Kenya Kwanza will hire more teachers to bridge the current deficit. "Inside two years, we will hire 160,000 teachers so that every school will have sufficient teachers." Rigathi also said Kenya Kwanza will also involve stakeholder engagement to fix the loopholes identified in the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC).
