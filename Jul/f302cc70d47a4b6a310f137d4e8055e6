The Media Council of Kenya (MCK) has condemned an alleged attack on a journalist and called on police to investigate the matter. Nation Media Group journalist Ian Byron was assaulted by unknown individuals on Sunday while on duty in Kakrao, Migori County. According to MCK Chief Executive Officer David Omwoyo, Byron reported the matter at Migori Police Station. "The MCK calls out the police to immediately investigate the incident that was reported at Migori Police Station after a journalist was attacked,  and take action against the assailants," he said. Omwoyo said such cases have been on the rise in the past few days after another journalist was harassed after writing a news story touching on Suna East Member of Parliament Junnet  Mohammed. In his statement, Omwoyo said profiling, denial of access to information, intimidation and harassment both online and offline are violations of press freedom. "The Council have noted with concern the rising cases targeting journalists and media enterprises from politicians," he added. He warned further that attacks on any journalist are a violation of Articles 33, 34 and 35 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The Articles highlight the freedom of expression, freedom of the media and right to access information. He cautioned all media houses and journalists to remain solid and be on the lookout for each other in ensuring safety and ensuring freedom of expression are achieved. The recently released Inter-Media Safety Charter requires all media outlets to take responsibility to ensure safety and practical protection of free speech as well as safety for journalists.
