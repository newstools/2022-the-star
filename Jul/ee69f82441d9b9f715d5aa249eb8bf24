Weam Sepetu does not want to be associated with ex-boyfriend Diamond Platnumz. Speaking to a Tanzanian blog, the former Miss Tanzania lamented, "Why is this question always haunting me? I am tired of it." Sepetu is currently dating a man who is not in the entertainment industry, but prefers to keep it private. She also denied dating singer Whozu, describing him as her brother and saying she's been helping to save his marriage. "I happen to be around male friends more than female friends because I feel safe around men," she said. "I call some of them about something about me and they are never jealous about it. Out of love, men wish you well."
