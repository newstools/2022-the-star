The Supreme Court decision to lock Mike Sonko out of the race for Mombasa governor is one of the most significant decisions to ever come from the apex  court. It will reverberate through out our incorrigibly corrupt body politic for generations to come. The deceitful kick-back addicts, who like to pass off as moral beacons and pillars of society, have been served a jolting blow by a court beyond which there is little room for maneuver. Sonko must surely serve as an example for politicians used to a pliant criminal justice system in which their stolen millions routinely buy justice. Long-suffering Kenyans must begin to feel a sense of hope. The Supreme Court has in one brush confirmed that all is not lost. The tireless EACC boss Twalib Mbarak has time and again appealed to the IEBC to shut the door on the likes of Sonko, and so has the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji. Chapter Six of the Constitution is unequivocal about the desperate desire for public officers whose past is not mired in corruption and socially reprehensible conduct. Sonko fate must send a chilling message to all in public office that monkey business will surely be punished without mercy and can spell the end of a career. Men and women of questionable character should never get anywhere near a public office. The IEBC should be bold enough to support the courts and join the push to reclaim our politics from criminals of all types.
