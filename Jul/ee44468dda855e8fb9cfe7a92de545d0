A teacher's union has appealed to the government to retain junior secondary in the primary section. Knut argues that those who will be joining junior secondary are still young and cannot be transferred to schools far from their homes. Bungoma South Knut executive secretary Ken Nganga told the Star on Thursday most children are between 11 and 13 years and cannot stay away from their families. “Knut is not quarrelling and accusing anybody, but we are only asking the government to adhere to our advice of retaining junior secondary in the primary section,” Nganga said. He also urged teachers to look for alternative ways of punishing pupils instead of caning them. “Don’t fall into the trap of being fired by the TSC. Let's all adhere to the laws put in place,” Nganga said. He urged teachers to remain professional and vote for a presidential candidate who will listen to their demands. Edited by A.N
