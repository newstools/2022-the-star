It is 10 days to the election and all eyes are on the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. Kenyan politicians and voters are super suspicious and will always question any action taken by the electoral agency. Social media has made it even worse with falsehood travelling 10 times the speed of truth. The IEBC must between now, during and after the election be available and ready 24-7 to respond to any concerns, counter any falsehoods and give clarity on half-truths. Today the commission has invited all the presidential candidates for a consultative meeting to give clarity on the concerns raised by Azimio on Forms 34A and 34B, which are used to print the presidential results. This is a good move, but what the IEBC needs to do between now and election day is to have daily media briefings to give updates and offer journalists an opportunity to raise any election-related matter. It must also be active on social media and its website must be updated with the latest information. Chebukati and team must also hold at least weekly session with presidential candidates and those seeking other elective posts just to clear any grey areas. A free, fair and credible election will restore voter confidence on the IEBC, which has over the years been been painted negatively.
