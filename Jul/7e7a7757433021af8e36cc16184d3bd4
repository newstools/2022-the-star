Senior Counsel Paul Muite has denied social media reports that he is suffering from cancer. The reports emerged early Friday after an internet user posted the lawyer's photo of him looking frail on Twitter. Muite dismissed the claims. "Reports on social media that I am sick with cancer are NOT TRUE. Given my age, I have had to shed off weight on purpose to keep sugar levels where they should be otherwise I have never felt better; enjoyed 1 & 1/2 hrs jogging in Ngong forest this morning," Muite said in a tweet. Rumours about Muite's ill health generated a buzz on the socials with a section of Kenyans condemning those spreading the false information. Among them is fellow senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi. Other Kenyans on Twitter also condemned those spreading the false information.
