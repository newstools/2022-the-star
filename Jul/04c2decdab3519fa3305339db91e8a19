Education CS George Magoha has taken issue with teachers who despise practical lessons saying it lessens learners' ability to grasp concepts. The CS said some teachers have resorted to offering only theory lessons leaving most learners to cram concepts as an option. "I want to encourage teachers that if you are teaching a topic like photosynthesis, go with the class to the bush and make them understand what is happening,” Magoha said. That way, the CS said, children will never forget what they have learnt. "Learning should be practical," he stressed. Magoha spoke on Saturday in Siaya county where he commissioned the first Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) classroom at Obambo Secondary School. His remarks arose from an engagement with a Form 4 student at the school whom he challenged with random Biology questions but the student failed to get none right. Magoha noted that 95 per cent of learners he engaged at the school on the importance of a tree only spoke about the importance of trees to the environment. "None of them could explain that a tree takes in carbon dioxide and gives oxygen back to us. We started CBC because we wanted our children to start thinking again," Magoha said. He blamed the 8:4:4 curriculum which he said is inclined towards excellence in exams rather than attainment of knowledge. Meanwhile, Magoha lauded primary school teachers who have been involved in the teaching of CBC pupils for being the best. The CS laid foundation stones for phase two of the CBC classroom projects at Siaya Township and Mbaga Girls Secondary schools. He noted that about 10 per cent of phase two construction work is already complete and everything will most likely be complete before the August 9 2022 general election. The CS assured schools that capitations funds will hit schools' accounts latest Monday next week. Magoha stressed the directive for school heads not to send away learners with fee arrears.
