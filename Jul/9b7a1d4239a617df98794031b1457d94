Four suspects were killed in Nakuru County on Thursday night. Nakuru Police Commander Peter Mwanzo confirmed that the suspects were gunned down by the police who were on night patrol. "There are four suspects who were killed last night from a notorious gang group known as "Confirm" and have been taking advantage of the residents of this area," Mwanzo said. The Commander added the "Confirm" gang group is a big umbrella and the suspects were under a sub group called "Nyuki". According to Mwanzo, there had been speculation that members of the gang had previously killed two people in that area after the police received a tip from the community. Mwanzo said, "The police were on patrol in that area at around 1 am when they started shooting after identifying a member of the gang walking around." He said the other suspects managed to escape with some of them being injured. The police commander added that he has received reports saying some gang-members want to surrender themselves to the authorities. "That is a good thing that they will not be forced to surrender and they are free to do so any time, Mwanzo added. The search continued and the police found sim cards, highly poisonous arrows and large quantities of marijuana. Mwanzo cautioned the youths who are used by politicians to cause chaos and indulge in crime to refrain from such actions.
