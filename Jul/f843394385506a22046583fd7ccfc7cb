The United States International University- Africa has appointed a new Vice-Chancellor. According to a statement from the varsity council chair Kris Ole-Senanu, Marjee Ensign will serve as VC from September 1, 2022. "Ensign will work in close alignment with the DVC in charge of academic and Student Affairs and other board members," the statement reads. Ensign has taken over from Freida Brown whose term as interim VC was extended for four months in May. Brown was recalled in August 2021 to serve on a nine-month contract after the exit of former VC Paul Tiyambe. Tiyambe had served for a period of five years. The council thanked Brown for taking part in the transition witnessed by the change of management. "The university council would like to take this opportunity to thank Freida Brown for magnanimous facilitation during the transition from our former VC and Ensign," the statement reads. According to the council, Ensign currently serves as the President of the American University of Nigeria (AUN) in Yola since 2017. "She was requested to return to AUN in 2021, having assumed the position of VC or president of Dickinson College from 2017-2021," the statement reads. Ensign holds a PhD from the University of Maryland in International Politics and Economics. "Ensign particularly enjoys interacting with students and with all members of the university and is looking forward to engaging with USIU-Africa Community from September," the statement reads. When Ensign takes office, she will be able to oversee activities in five academic schools, student affairs, admissions, registration, and the library. Others are faculty development, information technology, operations, and implementation of the 2021-2026 strategic plan.
