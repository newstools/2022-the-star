Ringtone Apoko will be charging 500k for club appearances and Sh1 million for performance. "I am an expensive artiste and Kenyans want to see me perform for them," he said. "Just research and see where I have performed before. I used to perform in church and crusade concerts, but I have not performed in clubs." He has changed his brand name to Ringtone Blington KE, inspired by his new dress code. "My expensive pieces of jewellery will be my identity," he said. Ringtone quit the gospel industry two weeks ago and has promised his fans his first song as a secular artiste this week. "The song is called 'Mpenzi pamoja'. I wrote the song and I am hoping I will get someone to love me since I am now singing love songs," he said.
