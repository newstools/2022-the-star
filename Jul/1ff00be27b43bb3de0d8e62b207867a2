Azimio running mate Martha Karua has been requested to tour Siaya county and unite coalition members after her boss Raila Odinga’s last visit caused a division. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who doubles up as the Azimio chairman, has also been urged to advice Raila to steer clear of the ODM six-piece narrative in his Nyanza backyard. Siaya Senate aspirant on Movement for Democracy and Growth party ticket James Wamban said the Raila-Karua ticket risks losing a sizeable chunk of votes because of what the Azimio did when he visited the county on July 2. “The Azimio brigade’s tour of Siaya was turned into an ODM affair where Raila endorsed ODM candidates,” he said. "We respect Raila as our father but his actions offended a huge number of voters. “I am urging our mother, Karua, to tour Siaya and embrace all candidates in Azimio. Our sibling, ODM, is bullying us.” Wamban said voters have learnt to separate wheat from chaff, and will be electing leaders with fresh ideas, political parties notwithstanding. The Siaya senate candidate further alleged that devolution has failed in the entire Luo Nyanza region where ODM has been the dominant party. ODM candidates in Siaya are currently experiencing an onslaught from others candidates as independents as well as those running on Azimio affiliate parties other than ODM.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
