Lately, Kenyan athletes have been denied the traditional glory they enjoyed on the global stage by their compatriots who shifted allegiance to other countries. The reasons behind the departure of Kenyan athletes to other countries vary. Kenya has been a hunting ground for countries keen on tapping into its rich talent. A burning desire for wealth, and individual and national honours, undoubtedly, also serve as incentives for the athletes and the countries that scout them. Over the years, several Kenyan athletes have shifted allegiance to rival countries in major global shows. The script reads the same at the 2022 Oregon Championships in Eugene, where a star-studded list of Kenyans have turned their guns on their motherland. The 2016 African Athletics Championships gold medalist Norah Jeruto Tanui leads a stellar list of Kenyans who have transferred their allegiance in search of fame and money. Jeruto, 27, switched her nationality to Kazakhstan and is currently attached to the Altay Athletics club (professional track and field club) in Kazakhstan.
