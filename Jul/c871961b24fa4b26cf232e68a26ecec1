The government through Uwezo fund has disbursed Sh6.75 million to registered groups in Maragua subcounty. The groups on Tuesday received cheques worth Sh6.75 million in Wezesha and Endeleza categories. Wezesha category features groups that are receiving funds for the first time while Endeleza category refinances groups that have previously received funds. Speaking at Kimorori-Kenol grounds while issuing the cheques, Maragua MP Mary Waithera urged the beneficiaries to remain consistent and make good use of the funds by improving their livelihoods. "The fund has grown from Sh18 million in 2013 to Sh36 million thereby enhancing economic growth and gearing towards the realisation of the goals of vision 2030.” The 50 groups include 34 new ones which received cheques worth Sh3.4 million in the Wezesha category and 16 groups which received Sh3.35 million as Endeleza fund. “Enhance your economic growth through the funds and the knowledge that Uwezo Fund officials have impacted on you,” she told the beneficiaries. The fund is accessible to registered groups of women, youth and persons with disabilities and covers 70 per cent of the women population and 30 per cent of the men population. Phillis Kiarie, the chairperson of one of the groups that was being financed for the first time, lauded the government for setting up the fund. “Our group Better Life Women Group has today received Sh100,000, which we will use to start a poultry project and improve our livelihoods and that of our families,” Kiarie said.
