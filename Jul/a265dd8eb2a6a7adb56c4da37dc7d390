Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah was on Tuesday accompanied by his wife Meller Luchiri to the presidential debate venue at the Catholic University of East Africa in Nairobi. This was the first time she appeared in public with Wajackoyah since he declared interest in the presidency. During a previous TV interview, Wajackoyah said his wife lives in the US while their three children - two daughters and a son lived in the UK. First born child, a son, is called Ty Luchiri, and daughters Marjorie Luchiri and last born Marz Luchiri. Wajackoyah and Meller, an African-American, were married in early 90s. The two soulmates walked down the aisle in February 2020. "This day, I married my best friend and confidant!n January 4, 2020. The best is yet to come," Meller said in a post on her Facebook page. A lot still remains unknown about Meller but an online search indicates that she formerly worked in the aviation industry.
