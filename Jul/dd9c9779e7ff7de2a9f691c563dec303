Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua on Wednesday had a rough time campaigning in Meru county after chaos erupted in one of his rallies. Gachagua who has pitched tents in the county since Monday was forced to end his campaigns in Mutuati, Igembe North, after rival groups started throwing stones at each other. While reacting to the incident, Gachagua took to Facebook to condemn the masterminds of the violence. "Any person who thinks of using our unemployed youths to cause violence is primitive and will be ashamed by the resounding Kenya Kwanza victory in the next 24 days," Gachagua wrote. Gachagua was flown out of the area in a chopper after he vacated the chaotic scene. What caused the violent incident was yet to be established by the time of going to press. Reports blame local politics for the violence. Police were forced to hurl teargas to disperse the rowdy groups. Others whisked to safety were Meru Senator Mithika Linturi and South Imenti Member of Parliament Kathuri Murungi.
