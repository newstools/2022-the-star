Tiktoker Ian Asunya, also known as Nduru Man, is raising his daughter alone. Nduru Man told Word Is he got a child with an Arabic girl who left immediately after she gave birth. According to the content creator, the girl's dad was not okay with his daughter sharing a child with Nduru Man, who was broke then. The comedian said his baby mama was later married off to a man in Dubai, where she relocated to after leaving Kenya. Nduru Man wanted to follow her then but raising money for transport was hard. "Her number is always off. I looked for her every place I knew I could trace her but I did not manage to get her." The Tiktoker became an internet sensation after screaming President Uhuru's name outside the State House.
