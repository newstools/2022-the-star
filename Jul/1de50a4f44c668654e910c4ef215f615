Rugby Sevens captain Nelson Oyoo wants Shujaa to get their system right if they are to give a good account of themselves in the Commonwealth Games slated for Birmingham later this month. The Nakuru RFC winger, who made his Shujaa debut in the Dubai 7's in  2015, is excited about Kenya's prospect in the Club Games with the team boasting a blend of youth and experience. "The challenge comes within us and we must get our system right if we intend to go deep in the competition. Players have to abide by the coaches' instructions and remain committed to the common course." "There's a reason for optimism. The team is a mixture of youth and experienced players. While the younger athletes bring energy and enthusiasm, accomplished players add the much-needed flexibility and knowledge to the game," he said. He added: "There are exciting times ahead for Shuja should we bring our best attributes to Birmingham. Kenya are in Pool 'D'  of the competition alongside Australia, Jamaica and neighbours Uganda. Oyoo took over the armband from Amonde and hopes to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor by winning a medal before hanging up his boots. "Collins Injera is a legend who did Kenya proud on many occasions. He led by example on and off the field. The same can be said of Amonde who managed a medal while leading Shujaa. Now that it's my turn, I am itching to also crown my career in style." Injera holds second place for the number of tries scored in the World Rugby Sevens Series with 271.
