Kibera Girls Soccer are targeting big names as they seek to remodel their squad ahead of the 2022-23 Kenya Women's Premier League season, coach Ramadhan Vijago has confirmed. The Slum Girls made an immediate return to the top-flight women's league after a season in the Division One League. Vijago said Kibera will sign at least eight experienced players that can help the team maintain their status in the women's cut-throat cadre. The Defense, midfield and attack have all been earmarked for improvement. "We are not just going to sign any player. We are looking for quality additions to bolster our squad which will be depleted by the time the league starts in September," Vijago hinted. "We will be guided by statics and experience will be a vital asset for a player to don our colours next season. The whole attack will be re-shaped while the midfield will have a new look. Two central defenders will be a fresh breath to the squad." Kibera topped Division One Zone A league with 46 points-one better than second-placed Moving The Goal Post-MTG United. MTG will play Gideons Starlets in the playoffs slated for this weekend to determine the third team to join Royal Starlets and Kibera in WPL. "We currently have 18 players but about eight won't be available when the league commences because of academic commitment. There are players that have been training with us and we want to retain their services." "We have learned our lessons and the setbacks we have experienced will toughen us. We want to take a bold approach and become a fearsome team for opponents."
