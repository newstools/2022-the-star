United Democratic Alliance party has warned against numbers used by fraudsters to con unsuspecting supporters. In a statement, secretary general, Veronica Maina said the scammers have been calling Kenyans, asking them to contribute money towards party activities. Maina stated that the party had received numerous complaints and the party's administrators traced three phone numbers involved in the  scheme. '"This is to inform you that the contacts listed below do not belong to the UDA party but to conmen who have in the last few days have  fraudulently obtained or attempting to obtain funds from innocent Kenyans," she said on Thursday. The phones numbers include; 0722210031, 0745021896 and 0726482097. The SG insisted that the party did not ask its members to contribute to any of the party's activity and neither does it charge for member participation. She added that the party only contacts its members through its official channels listed on the website. Maina said the matter has been reported to the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI). In recent years con games have increased rapidly targeting politicians and their supporters with fraudsters posing as party officials to con Kenyan of their hard earned money. The majority of  targeted Kenyans are those who have registered their numbers with political parties.
