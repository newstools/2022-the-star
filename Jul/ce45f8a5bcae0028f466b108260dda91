Kiss FM presenter Oga Obinna is set to release his debut album, which he says is a cocktail of genres. Speaking to Word Is, the comedian-cum-radio personality said, "There's RnB, rhumba, dance hall and some Jason Derulo-like vibes in it." He added that he didn't want to be known by just one genre and that he is yet to get the name of the album. "I'm considering the names 'Diversity' or 'Experiment'." Obinna has released his latest single, 'Pause', whose video shooting took him a whole afternoon in a studio set-up. “God gave me talents, and I am putting them to play. Y’all ain’t ready,” he concluded. Obinna co-hosts Kiss FM morning show together with Kamene Goro.
