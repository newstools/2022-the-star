Secular artist Ngaruiya Junior 'King of Kigooco' has hit out at Muigai wa Njoroge, claiming the upcoming artists were being oppressed. Ngaruiya said Muigai who is supposed to be a mentor to the young artists, since he has been in the music career for years, is pulling them down by taking a part of their share. In a statement in his local dialect on Facebook, Ngaruiya claimed Muigai only thinks about himself and doesn't believe there are other great singers other than him. "Muigai you are an experienced singer. In music, you are supposed to be a mentor to young musicians. But now, you are an oppressor to them. If you are given their money, it's a must you keep part of it. When you get them somewhere working together, you must find a way to scatter them so that you are left there alone. This is because you don't believe there is a singer bigger/ higher than you," he said. He also claimed that Muigai had said that he would be kicked out of UDA yet he had been a supporter of the William Ruto- led party. "You ensured the Skiza code for my song for UDA it's deleted because of jealousy. Let me tell you, your God is also the God of the singers who don't have power/godfathers," he said. When Muigai was reached out to comment on Ngaruiya's post, he said he was not in a position to comment as that was a non-issue. "I cannot comment on such nonsense," he said.
