Microsoft has begun testing three different search taskbar widgets for the Windows 11 taskbar. Windows 11, according to the Verge, ships with a search button on the taskbar, which can be disabled and only shows the search logo. With the new taskbars, one experiment is the usual search icon, while two others include a small or large search bar in the taskbar. Before the changes are made, Microsoft is looking for feedback before rolling out the update fully. Microsoft is also adding notification badges on icons and bringing back the weather widget on the taskbar. When you open the Widgets board a banner will appear at the top of the board providing more information on what triggered the notification badge.
