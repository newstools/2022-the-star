Rachel Ruto, the wife of Deputy President William Ruto showered him with praise, shortly after the Presidential debate. In a statement, Mama Rachel said the DP was outstanding in the debate, as she prayed that God sees him through the presidential journey. "Congratulations Bill. You were perfect. The last man standing. May God carry you through," she said in a tweet. Her word followed the 90-minute debate on Tuesday where Ruto who is seeking to succeed his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, responded to questions posed on key issues affecting Kenyans. His opponent, Raila Odinga of the Azimio la Umoja coalition pulled a no-show for the debate. In a statement, Raila's campaign secretariat said, "We are not attending the presidential debate; the town hall engagement pushed to a later date. Currently selling our agenda in Meru." The debate was held at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) on Tuesday. The debate which was organised in two tiers had one candidate show up for each tier. Roots party candidate George Wajackoyah arrived at the venue but left shortly, insisting that he wouldn't be part of it, unless there were four candidates sharing a platform. Ruto's allies also took time to congratulate him for a job well done, in the presidential debate. "Congratulations Deputy President William Ruto on a great debate. The Last Man Standing," Mudavadi said.
