With only two ingredients required, cooking ugali is one of the simplest Kenyan dish you can make for your friends and family. Ugali is a staple dish for many Kenyan households. Many people often have ugali leftover but little idea of what to do with it. I used to eat cold leftover ugali until my friend told me that you can combine fresh maize flour with the leftover, to get a fresh, hot fresh dish straight out of the sufuria. Step 1 Add water to a sufuria and bring it to boil Step 2 Cut your ugali into small pieces, and add them to the boiling water. Mash them for a minute, before adding your maize flour. You will not even feel the lumps once your ugali is ready. Step 1 Cut your ugali into long strips, removing the hard crust on the outside. Step 2 Sprinkle salt(optional) on the ugali. Step 3 Put oil in your pan, and let it get hot before putting it in the pan. Fry on all sides before serving. If you want to go a little extra, You can add eggs to spice things up. Step 1 After removing the crust and cutting your ugali in long strips, set them aside. Step 2 Beat 2 eggs in a bowl and add your necessary spices including salt. Step 3 Dip your strips in the beaten eggs and let it soak for 30 seconds Step 4 In another plate, pour some breadcrumbs, then preheat your oil in a pan. Step 5 Remove piece by piece of the ugali, roll them in the breadcrumbs before frying. Enjoy with ketchup or mustard, over chicken or eat as a snack. Step 1 Cut your ugali into small cubes Step 2 Cut tomatoes, bell peppers (hoho) in a small bowl before adding 2 eggs. Combine, then add salt and desired spices. Step 3 Heat oil in a pan, and throw in your ugali. Ensure all sides are coated with oil, before adding the egg and tomato mixture. Combine and scramble the eggs until everything is coated. Cook for 5 minutes. Serve and enjoy!
