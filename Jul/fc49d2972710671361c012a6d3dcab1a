Fresh from winning a bronze medal in the men’s 400m-H at the African Senior Championships last June, Wiseman Were is hoping for repeat performance on his debut at the  Commonwealth Games in Birmingham later this month. Were is confident of prevailing at the Club Games considering the commitment and discipline he has put into training. The three-time national champion believes he is capable of pulling a surprise if all goes according to plan. " I am aware of the stiff competition that awaits us but I have my eyes fixed on the podium," he noted. Kenya has not medaled in the Commonwealth Games since the 1994 edition in Canada, where Gideon Biwott and Barnabas Kinyor won silver and bronze respectively. “Anything can happen during the race but I have trained well and I am ready hence I know I will make it. I am in good shape and the preparations with my coach are efficient. Underrate me at your own peril,” Were said. The 24-year-old looks forward to a time when he will be a great inspiration to upcoming athletes. “I want to run well so that can inspire the future generation. I want to be my own hero," Were said. He added: "There is a lot of pressure in athletics but I always try to avoid that by preparing for the best and waiting for what may come without overwhelming myself." Were’s coach, Dennis Mwanzo is equally confident that his athletes will pull off good results considering the comprehensive training they have undertaken together. “Were has not raced in the 400m Hurdles for long since I started training him last year. However, I am confident he will come back home with a medal. His qualification at the Commonwealth Games gives me hope that he will make it to the podium," Mwanzo concluded. He added: "He is a fast learner and he has improved immensely since I started training him. He has the discipline and the focus to learn new things and I am just impressed.”
