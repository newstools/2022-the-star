The murder of IEBC technology manager Chris Msando is one of Kenya's most high-profile unsolved cases. He was outspoken that the transmission system for the 2017 election was foolproof. Today (Thursday) marks the fifth anniversary of the discovery of his tortured body dumped near a thicket on Nairobi's outskirts. His death cast a pall over that election. The slaying bore the hallmarks of a political assassination. The motive seemed to have been linked to the outcome of the hotly contested poll because he was key to its credibility. The killers might have wanted to get passwords. The police made a series of routine promises about no stone left unturned. It seems not a pebble has been disturbed. Msando's family and the public want assurance such a high-profile manager could not be picked from his car yet his killers remain free. Msando must never be forgotten. The killers must be brought to justice. Perhaps Martha Karua can do it. The police have cracked many complicated cases. Then-Police IG Joseph Boinnet said the murder was a grave crime and a special DCI Homicide team had been set up. “We are following certain crucial leads we believe could lead to the arrest and prosecution of the murderers,” Boinnet said.
