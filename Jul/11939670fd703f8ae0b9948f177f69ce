Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua is no doubt a household name in Kenya. Having been appointed by Deputy President William Ruto as his running mate, the MP stands a chance to be Kenya's second deputy President under the 2010 constitution. While much can be said about him in the political field, less is known about his family. Nevertheless, Gachagua is a family man; he has a wife and two sons. His wife pastor Dorcas Wanjiku shot into the limelight recently after he was appointed Ruto's deputy. The two have been married for 35 years. Until the presidential debate held at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa on Tuesday, their sons' whereabouts were unknown to many. It is while making his introductory remarks at the debate that Gachagua unpacked details of his little-known sons to the nation. "I'm Rigathi, family is the basic unit of society, and the nation, strong families make strong nations, I'm the head of a family and it's my pleasure and privilege to introduce my wife Dorcas, and my firstborn son Kelvin Gachagua a software engineer and my second born son, Keith Ikinu Rigathi, medical doctor, who helps me to run the family business," he said. Gachagua's two sons have maintained a low profile and kept their presence on social media private. The Star has established that Keith was among the top students in the 2010 KCSE exams. He is an alumnus of Alliance High School and was position 17 nationally in that year's KCSE exam. He attained mean grade A plain of 86.92 points.
