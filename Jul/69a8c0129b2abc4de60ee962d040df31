Anita Nderu is expecting a child with her husband Barret. The former Trend host shared a video of her pregnancy photo shoot on her social media platforms yesterday. In the video, one can see the bulging tummy as a smiling and over-the-moon Anita poses for the camera. She captioned the video: "Extra Extra ft @barrettraftery." Anita Nderu sparked pregnancy rumours a month ago after a post she shared and fans were quick to notice the body change. In one of the photos, Anita was dressed in a white gown alone, while in another photo she was standing next to her husband, Barrett Raftery. She was showcasing her beautiful dress, something her fans did not seems to care much about. Anita married Barrett in September last year. This will be her first child.
