Murang’a Catholic Bishop James Maria Wainaina has criticised Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah over his plans to legalise bhang should he ascend to power. Speaking during Family Day celebrations at Kangari Parish on Sunday, Wainaina said that leaders who are trying to legalise drugs, among other social vices, should be condemned and ignored for the sake of future generations. The cleric said the presidency needs a person of high integrity who will protect members of the society from drug abuse, among other forms of addiction. “Talking of legalising bhang is not only wrong but also overly unethical and we cannot allow it since the vice has greatly affected our young people," Wainaina said. “The family unit is being threatened by drug abuse which leads to breakups, violence and even deaths at times, hence Prof Wajackoyah’s proposal on bhang should not go unchallenged." Bishop Wainaina specifically singled out the proposal to legalise marijuana and prostitution in the country, saying bhang is listed as illegal in the Narcotic, Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Control (Amendment) Bill 2020. The cleric called on Kenyans to look beyond populism, especially during the current electioneering season and soberly reflect on the consequences of such possible policies. “This nation must be protected. Such proposals would destroy what we have painstakingly nurtured over the decades and therefore must be challenged and rejected by all of us,” he said. The bishop further said legalising bhang would be an expressway for the influx of other hard drugs that are already a menace in many countries, calling on the authorities to take action against such misleading utterances. Wainaina called upon Kenyans not to fall into the traps of smooth-talking leaders who have no clear manifestos and who may, in the long run, indulge the country in more complex problems.
