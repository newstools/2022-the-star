Sauti Sol lead singer Bien Aime got a tattoo as his wedding ring, which he says serves the same purpose as a physical ring. Speaking in an interview with SPM Buzz, Bien said he lost his actual wedding ring and opted for a ring tattoo as a permanent replacement. "I had it but it got lost and I chose to have a tattoo instead because it won't go anywhere and also I feel I have a bad relationship with items," he said. Bien added that a tattoo makes him feel more attached to his wife. "I feel like you can't attach value to an item," he said. "People get angry when they see their lovers not without their wedding rings, why? They are not a dog that you put a leash on them."
