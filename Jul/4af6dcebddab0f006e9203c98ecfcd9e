The electoral commission has invited all the four presidential candidates for a consultative meeting over concerns raised on result tabulation forms 34A and 34B. In a statement on Thursday, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairperson Wafula Chebukati said the meeting will take place at the Bomas of Kenya on Friday, July 29 from 11 am. "The purpose of this letter is to invite you and or your representatives to a consultative meeting to address the concerns raised," Chebukati said. He copied the letter to all the presidential candidates Raila Odinga of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition, George Wajackoyah of Roots Party, David Waihiga of Agano party and William Ruto of UDA. On Wednesday, Raila's Azimio raised questions on the printing of the Form 34 A and 34 B by a Greek firm Inform Lykos. In a letter signed by Azimio chief legal adviser Paul Mwangi, Raila said his team noted “disturbing issues” after it emerged the IEBC printed two books of Form 34As. They are labelled as Book 1 of 2 and Book 2 of 2. Raila’s team is concerned that the second book could be used as a substitute "as it satisfies every requirement of electoral laws and regulations." IEBC commissioners who were with poll stakeholders in Athens said the extra Form 34As were needed as copies to observers, media, and other stakeholders. Raila's team dismissed the explanation. “We reject this explanation because Book 2 of 2 from which it is alleged copies for stakeholders will be obtained is more than just a copy. "It is actually a fully-fledged Form 34As complete with all security features similar to those in Book 1 of 2,” Mwangi said in the letter. Azimio is also concerned that the polls agency is not printing Form 34Bs, into which polling station results recorded in Form 34A are collated. The United Democratic Alliance in a letter, also raised the concerns by Azimio, calling for an urgent meeting with the Commission.
