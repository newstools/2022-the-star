Mt Elgon subcounty in Bungoma will benefit from an initial Sh80 million from the Equalization Fund released after a four-year spirited fight by Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. The funds will be shared among the wards of Kamugul, Kubura, Chepyuk, Sambocho, Koshok, Sacho, Kapkurongo, Chongeywo and Mt Elgon Forest. In January 2018, Wangamati took a team from the Commission for Revenue Allocation on a tour to Mt Elgon in a campaign to have the region considered for the Equalization Fund. According to Wangamati, Mt Elgon is a marginalised subcounty whose redemption is only hinged on a 'Marshal Plan' of sorts. During the visit to the region, the governor showed the team the best and the worst of Mt Elgon and drew their attention to the lack of social amenities in the region. Speaking to a CRA delegation led by chairperson Jane Kiringai and the vice chairperson Humphrey Watanga last week, the governor stated that Mt Elgon had for a long period been neglected by the revenue allocators. Yet the area has the best soils in the region and the potential to feed the entire Western through agricultural investments. Kiringai asked the county auditor to follow-up and ensure the funds serve the people according to the governor’s agreement during the signing of the cheque. Other counties that have benefited from the Equalization Fund include Turkana, Lamu, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta and Isiolo. The Equalization Fund is meant for the provision of basic services, including water, roads, health facilities and electricity in the counties considered marginalised. On Thursday, area Member of Parliament Fred Kapondi lauded Governor Wangamati for his efforts and pleaded with the people to support him in his second gubernatorial bid. Residents who attended the handing over of the cheque expressed their joy and promised to be the commission’s watchdog on the utilization of the funds. Edited by Henry Makori
