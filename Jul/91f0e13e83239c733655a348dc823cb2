Windsor's Kanana Muthomi and Kiambu's Peter Waiharu emerge as winners during the 12th leg of the Safaricom Junior tournament at Kenya Airforce Golf club on Sunday. The two posted 41 and 81 points respectively. Twelve-year-old Muthomi claimed the best girl title for the second time after also taking the top prize in the category during the fifth leg of the tour in Machakos. Peter Waiharu won the boy’s title after falling short last weekend in Nakuru. "I feel proud to emerge the winner of the juniors' tournament. This is my second time participating in the tournament after the first one in Nakuru last week. I failed to clinch the top position in Nakuru, but I am now glad that my hard work and training has earned me victory," said Waiharu. "I thank Safaricom for such an excellent programme that is giving young people like me an opportunity to showcase our talents. I also thank my brother, who introduced me to golf four years ago," she said. Sunday's tournament attracted 85 juniors with 60 juniors showing up for the golf clinic, which was part of the day's activities. The next leg of the tour is scheduled for July 23 at Vet Lab Golf Club. To grow the sport among junior players in the country, Safaricom has partnered with the Junior Golf Foundation to tap and nurture young talent.
