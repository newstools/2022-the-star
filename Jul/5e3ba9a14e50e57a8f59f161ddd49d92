2017 World Under-18 400m silver medalist Mary Moraa is bracing herself up for the stiff competition in the women's 800m race ahead of a face-off with Olympic 800m champion Athing Mu in the World Championships at Eugene, Oregon. Moraa is scheduled to step foot on track for the first time at Hayward Field on July 21 for the heats. During the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Moraa did not make it to the finals but she is confident that with the time and commitment invested in training, she will make it to the finals set for July 24. She noted that lowering her time would be a target achieved. "Considering the dedication I have given to training, I believe I am ready to compete. I cannot claim the win because anything can happen during the race and anybody can win. However, I am optimistic that I will run well and get to the finals," Moraa said. "Lowering my time will make me feel good. You can't know how well someone has trained and so I don't want to raise my hopes. When I meet them (competitors), whether in the heats, semi-finals or finals, let the best runner win." The 22-year-old also highlighted that she is in good shape to compete and she does not feel intimidated by climate change. "At the moment, I am fit and I believe God will keep me healthy until I get to Oregon. The environment does not threaten me because it's not very different from here. The only challenge would be the extreme heat which is manageable," she said. Moraa also expressed her disappointment towards visa delays which she  noted, will disrupt the performance of athletes.
