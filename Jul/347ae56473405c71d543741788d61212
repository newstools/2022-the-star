2018 men's 10,000m Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Rodgers Kwemoi Chumo has tipped Kenya to exorcise the ghosts that have denied the country a gold medal in the event. The 25-year-old Japan-based athlete who traces his roots in the talent-laden Mount Elgon District failed to make the podium at Oregon22 in Eugene on Monday. Stanley Waithaka Mburu was the toast for Kenya, wheezing away with unexpected ease to the silver podium at an impressive 27:27.90. The sensational youngster was denied the crown by Uganda's Joshua Cheptegei who cruised to a second world 10,000m title in 27:27.43, becoming only the fourth man to win back-to-back 10,000m world titles. Cheptegei's compatriot Jacob Kiplimo bagged the bronze after coming third in 27:27.97. The other best-placed Kenyan was Daniel Mateiko who emerged eighth in 27:33.57. However, Kwemoi reckons that Kenyans have ultimately unearthed the magic wand that will halt the ascendancy of the Ugandans in the race. “It won't be long before we clinch gold in the world championship especially if you consider just how close we came this time around. “The national trials in Nairobi also unearthed some great athletes with the potential to shine on the global stage. Athletics Kenya has done an amazing job nurturing us right from the scratch and Waithaka is a perfect example of such efforts.” Kwemoi's sentiments were echoed by Uganda’s 10,000m world champion Joshua Cheptegei who tipped Kenyan athletes to pose the biggest threat in future events. Cheptegei was full of rosy words for silver medalist Mburu, saying he had a full life ahead of him on the track. “Mburu is an upcoming athlete. He ran well today. He has to continue learning and I’m sure in the next few years, he will be on top of the game. He has a great future if he continues to do the right thing,” Cheptegei said. The coveted medal has been elusive in recent years and it's now two decades since Charles Kimathi bagged Kenya's last gold at the World Championships in Edmonton, Canada, in 2001. The trio of  Kwemoi, Daniel Mateiko and the 2018 world Under-20 10,000m Waithaka had hoped to break the jinx in the 25-lap race but all their plans fell apart when Uganda's Cheptegei stormed to gold. In total, Kenya has three gold medals at the World Championships won by Paul Kipkoech (1987), Moses Tanui (1991) and Charles Kamathi (2001). Ethiopia boasts the highest number of gold in the race, having bagged nine thus far through Haile Gebreselassie (1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999), Kenenisa Bekele (2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009) and Ibrahim Jeilan in 2011. Kwemoi said he struggled to impress in Eugene amidst an undisclosed nagging malaise that has dogged him for five years now. “I thank God I completed the race although I wasn't feeling very well.” He said a change in tact that departed from the norm delivered Kenya's only medal in the race. “We all agreed none of us should lead the race and we tucked ourselves in the leading pack and that's how we managed to bag the silver through Waithaka.” Kwemoi, who placed fourth at the 2020 Tokyo Games, said he would take a deserved break to recover from the bristling contest in Oregon. “I don't have any race coming up soon so I'll be going back home to take a break for some time as I figure out my next race.”
