A storm is brewing ahead of the August 9 polls following reports that the Azimio La Umoja coalition and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance have scheduled their last rallies at the same venue. Both camps are expected to hold their last major rallies on August 6. A statement by Azimio secretary general Junet Mohamed on Tuesday stated that the coalition will hold its major rally at Nyayo Stadium. "As the country approaches the general election in 20 days, the Azimio team wishes to thank all Kenyans of goodwill who have turned up in their millions all over the country at meetings, rallies and in person to join in this historic journey to a fair, just, prosperous and inclusive nation," the statement reads. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance had also stated that their last rally would be at the national Nyayo stadium. August 6 will be the last day of campaigns ahead of General Elections on August 9. Candidates are not allowed to campaign or hold rallies two days before the polls. Candidates, more often presidential ones, stage mega rallies to implore Kenyans to back them.
