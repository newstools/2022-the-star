Agano Party presidential candidate David Mwaure has said it is a lifestyle choice to become corrupt or not. Speaking on Tuesday during the presidential debate at the Catholic University for Eastern Africa, Mwaure said he has never been involved in corruption. He pointed out that he has had opportunities where he could steal clients' money as an advocate but he chose not to. "It starts the lowest unit... I can stand here and say I have not been accused. I have not stolen clients' money. It's a lifestyle that I'm in," he said. "It's not that I have not had an opportunity, have not been appointed at the top. No, I have had occasions where I've led, but also in my private life." The Bishop also said as a man of the cloth and a lawyer, if elected, he will not steal from Kenyans and he will protect the country from financial scandals. "We will not have our development funds stashed abroad. This is why we are here, poor for 59 years," he added.
