Thirty Ipoa officers are being trained on how to monitor police during next month's election. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Tuesday launched a two-day training to equip the 30 officers on observing key milestones of police operation. The officers are drawn from Ipoa's national and regional offices. They will be trained on human rights, investigating reported cases against police officers, collecting data and documentation. They will also cover standards on the use of force, forensics, witness management and litigation. KNCHR is partnering with Network of African National Human Rights Institutions for the training. Other partners in the training include the African Policing Civilian Oversight Authority and the Independent Medico-Legal Unit. "...[the training] aims at strengthening the capacity of the officers in monitoring the conduct of the police officers during the 2022 general election and beyond," the lobbies told journalists. "This will ensure that officers who apply excessive force, or are involved in extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, gender-based violence, among other human rights violations are held accountable." Further, the lobbies say the training will focus on how officers can collaborate with other institutions such as the KNCHR in ensuring the National Police Service executes its duty as required and directed by the law. Past general elections in the country have been marred by excessive use of force from police officers in dealing with protests and other forms of public disorder. Edited by A.N
