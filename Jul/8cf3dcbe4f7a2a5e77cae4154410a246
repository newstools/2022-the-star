Our special species of politicians, always lighting quick to see what is in it for them rather than what they could do for the people, are up to the usual desires of grandeur. Retiring governors have crafted a plot that should see them living a cosseted life for the rest of their lives until they die. They propose that their retirement perks should include 80 per cent of their current pay, a personal assistant, a vehicle, a driver and a one-off gratuity. Their needs are hugely exaggerated and out of sync with the economic circumstances of the country. One of the fundamental objects of devolution, which is to promote socio-economic development, is yet be realised 10 years on. It is worth noting that in 10 years, not one county has built a mansion for the governor, which was a legal requirement. However, service to the people seems a strange inconvenience to these political elite. The only idea that excites their interest is talk of cash hitting their bank accounts. We urge the Salaries Review Commission to take a dim view of their grossly overvalued sense of self.
