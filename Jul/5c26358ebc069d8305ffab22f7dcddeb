Nduru Man, the TikToker who trended after screaming President Uhuru Kenyatta's name outside State House, has taken a break. The Internet sensation was on Wednesday arrested again after screaming at DP Ruto's residence in Karen. Speaking to Word Is, Nduru Man said he had to cry so the security people could not beat him. "I was in Karen to do some deliveries there, and I asked about where the DP's residence is. I decided to create my content outside," he said. "I was arrested and taken to Karen police station, where I spent for the better part of the day on Wednesday." So, will he do such content again? "I am on a water break since I don't want more trouble with cops," he said. He was nabbed two weeks ago for doing comedy outside the State House.
