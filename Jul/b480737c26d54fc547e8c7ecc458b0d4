Azimio la Umoja presidential running mate Martha Karua has said that Kenyans deserve a president who will lead with dignity and eminence. In a statement on Monday, Karua said this person can only be Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, because he is also a stateman. "The esteemed Kenyan people deserve a head of state who will lead with dignity, eminence and distinction. My principal Raila Odinga is that Statesman," she said in a tweet. Speaking in Nakuru and Narok counties on the same day, Karua insisted that Kenya cannot be led by people who are angry, as she referred to Deputy President William Ruto's onslaught against President Uhuru Kenyatta in the last two days. "Let's stop being angry. If you are angry we will give you time to cool down. Those who are not angry like us, give us the job we continue working for Kenyans." Karua has previously said that should they be elected and have differences while in office, she would not bring them to the public as Ruto did. According to her, the issues at play will be solved behind closed doors. In his attacks on the President, DP Ruto has claimed that he was the one who made Uhuru president. He said that he forced Uhuru to press on, when he had given up and wanted to leave the presidency for Raila, by not taking part in the repeat polls of 2017. In a leaked audio, the DP confessed to wanting to slap Uhuru, had he not been the head of state. Ruto also claimed to have campaign more for the President including while he slept. "I used to wake up, hold three campaigns before the President woke up because he was my friend and there is no way I would let Raila take that seat away from him," Ruto said on Monday. "We are the people who woke up early to vote for the President. People of Meru would you want me to allow Uhuru to leave the seat we had given him for Raila?"
