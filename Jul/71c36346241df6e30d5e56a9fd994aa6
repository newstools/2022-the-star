World Health Organization has urged people to reduce the number of sexual partners amid the rising cases of monkey pox. WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday, that the best way to reduce the risk of exposure is by making safe choices on sexual partners. "For men who have sex with men and women with men, this includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners and reconsidering sex with new partners  must be considered," he said in a virtual press release. Tedros said all countries must focus on engaging and empowering communities of men who have sex with men. "This is to reduce the risk of monkey pox infection and onward transmission, to provide care for those infected, and to safeguard human rights and dignity," he added. He cautioned that transmission of monkey pox can also be spread through close contact between people, such as hugging, kissing, and on contaminated towels or bedding. "Although 98% of cases so far are among men who have sex with men, anyone exposed can get monkey pox, so WHO recommends that countries take action to reduce the risk of transmission to other vulnerable groups including pregnant women and children," he noted. The director added that stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus, and can fuel the outbreak. This is after WHO declared monkey pox a global health emergency on July 25. The classification is the highest alert that the WHO can issue and follows a worldwide upsurge in cases all over the world. The Director General Tedros said more than 16,000 cases have been reported from 75 countries.
