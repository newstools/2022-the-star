Boomerang open their Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league action with three matches on the card. The self-supporting side, who have players travelling for the ties from Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Nyahururu, are determined to put up a fight. “This will be our first league outing this year. We face a myriad of challenges since we all don’t come from the city,” said team manager Kevin Manono. “Despite all that, we are set for the task ahead. We thank KHF for understanding our situation and being helpful and giving us matches once a month.” “My players train separately in their bases but when we assemble, we will be ready to face our opponents.” Captain Lewis Nyachiro, Robert Osano, Joshua Oigo, Gibson Agunga, Feisual Charo and Victor Moracha will all play key roles in the three ties. Boomerang play General Service Unit (GSU) in the season-openeron Saturday. A day later, they are scheduled to play Makueni Bees before winding their fixtures against Nairobi City Council (NCC) . In the other matches, Thika play Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) in the men’s division. The ladies’ matches will see Net Navigators meet Amazon, New Hope tackle Anette Baraza and Esther Gathoni-led Jkuat. National Cereals and Produce Board face champions Nairobi Water in the main match of the weekend. Sunday matches will see Technical University of Kenya play Thika as Ulinzi confront Buccaneers.
