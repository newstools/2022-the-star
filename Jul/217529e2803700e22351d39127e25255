Nottingham Forest have completed the £17m signing of Liverpool defender Neco Williams on a four-year deal. The Wales right-back, 21, helped Fulham gain promotion to the Premier League after joining them on loan in January. Williams is Forest’s sixth signing of the transfer window as they prepare to return to the top flight. “Forest are a club with incredible history and the City Ground is a very special venue that I can’t wait to experience in full voice,” he said. “I’m really excited to join Forest and to help this great club move forwards in the Premier League. “Having spoken to the head coach, there’s a huge amount of ambition being shown and I can’t wait to join up with my new team-mates and get ready for the challenge ahead,” he added. Williams, who reached an agreement with Forest on Thursday, has 21 Wales caps and was influential as they secured a place at this year’s World Cup finals for the first time in 64 years. Williams, who came through the academy at Liverpool and made his first-team debut against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in 2019, featured in the Champions League group stage for Jurgen Klopp’s side last season before his loan switch to the Cottagers. Forest were promoted via the Championship play-off last season and have already bolstered their squad with incoming players including Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, Nigeria forward Taiwo Awoniyi and defender Giulian Biancone. Forest boss Steve Cooper said: “We’re delighted to have him on board. We believe he’s got an incredibly high ceiling and can play a huge role for us in our return to the Premier League.” Williams joined Forest at training on Monday before Tuesday’s friendly with Burton Albion.
