A quick start and dominance in the forward pack were the keys to the Simbas 42-7 demolition of Uganda in the Rugby World Cup qualifier on Saturday in France. Speaking on the sidelines, head coach Paul Odera said he was delighted with the victory. "We came up with a fast start and credit to the boys as they took the opportunities and we were able to control the game" added Odera. The former Kenya Under-20 coach said there was room for improvement for the semi-final showdown against Algeria, adding that some facets need to be worked on. "In the second half, we were not patient enough to put pressure on Uganda, especially in attack, where there were too many dropped passes.  This is something we need to work on in the next day or two ahead of the semifinal." The former international said he was satisfied with the forwards' work especially in the setpiece and d in defence. "Our lineout functioned well. We won all our throws and we had dominance in the scrum and I thought we scrambled well in defence when Uganda attacked which augurs well for our next match," said Odera. The tactician said playing in the Currie Cup in South Africa had hardened the team for the match against Uganda. "We learnt a few lessons playing against top-quality opposition and it prepared us well for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers. Inside Centre, John Okoth scored two tries with second row Thomas Okeyo. Scrumhalf Samuel Asati, eighth man Bethwell Anami, and substitute Teddy Akala scored a try each. Darwin Mukidza slotted five conversions with Jone Kubu adding one.  Kenya led 28-0 at the interval. In other fixtures, Algeria stunned Sénégal 35-12 while Zimbabwe beat Ivory Coast 38-11 and favourites Namibia thrashed Burkina Faso 71-5. The semifinals are slated for Wednesday with the final on Sunday. The winner qualifies for the Rugby World Cup in France next year.
