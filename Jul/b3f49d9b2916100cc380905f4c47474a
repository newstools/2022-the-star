Willy Paul has advised artistes to go the legal way if they are taken for granted by clients. He said some companies take advantage of Kenyan artistes since most of them do not speak out. "Artistes, in case a client is late to pay you, sue them!" he tweeted. "It's the only way we will earn back our respect as artistes. They delay your money, you call them, they ignore your calls and it's your money! Get serious, banaa!!" A few years back, Pozee fell victim to a con after organisers of an event refused to pay him after performing. Pozee took to Instagram to send the message across after they refused to pick or return his call after giving him two bouncing cheques.
