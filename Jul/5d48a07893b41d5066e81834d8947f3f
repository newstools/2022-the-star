Traders in Kisii were counting losses Friday after flash floods washed away their merchandise and ripped apart structures. Significant damages were reported on several residential and business premises set up along the river banks. John Moi, a reveller said the skies began leaking in torrents at 5 pm Friday evening washing away cloths displayed on the pavements. It also washed sand from several construction sites. Photos shared by some customers enjoying a drink at a hotel set at Nyalkomisaro river banks showed dozens of cars at the parking marooned in water. Inside one eatery, a man is seen carrying a woman while crossing a flooded floor. Kisii has been experiencing low-level rain for the last month before it ushered the weekend with fury. The rains caused a huge traffic snarl-up as some roads remained cut off from use by floods.
