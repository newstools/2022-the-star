Team Kenya will be seeking one of the two automatic slots in the Euro-Africa Group III Davis Cup tournament next month in  Algeria. Kenya missed out on qualification last year after losing to Benin 2-1 in the semi-final in Egypt and coach Francis Rogoi said they have learned lessons from last year's event. “Last year, we had challenges both from a financial and playing standpoint but credit to the boys; they played their hearts out and lost in the final four. This year, we will be going all out to secure qualification to Group 2 next year,” said Rogoi. Kenya face hosts Algeria, Morocco, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Morocco in the five-day event. Rogoi is expected to name his final team this week from the list that also includes siblings Kean and Kale Shah, who are based in Spain and have been playing ITF Junior Futures tournaments in Europe and Africa. Others are Kenya Open champion Ishamel Changawa, Albert Njogu, Ibrahim Kibet, Derrick Ominde and Australia-based Kevin Cheroot. Rogoi said the final squad will comprise four players but admitted that he is spoilt for choice. “ The players have been training well and a good number of them have what it takes to feature in the Davis Cup. So the selection headache is a good one to have for a coach,” added Rogoi. The former player said they hope to arrive two days early in order to acclimatize to the conditions. “It's quite hot and humid but I think two days will be good enough to acclimatize to the weather conditions and the playing surface. Rogoi said he expects a stern test from Morocco and Zimbabwe who are ranked 67th and 77 respectively. “ They are very good sides but am confident my team thy we will go and do the country proud” He added they will take one game at a time for the championship. Two nations will be relegated to Group four next year
