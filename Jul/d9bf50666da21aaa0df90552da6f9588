UDA candidate for Sabatia MP race Clement Sloya has urged his supporters to maintain peace before and after August 9 polls. He said Kenya is bigger than any individual and every citizen should maintain peace. "I urge all Sabatia people to remain peaceful during campaigns and after the polls. Elections come and go but we the electorate will remain and thus we should exercise restraint from hate speech which might throw our country into chaos and anarchy," Sloya said. He spoke to the Star on the phone at the weekend. The candidate said Kenyans should not be trapped in political utterances that may lead to an internal crisis. Sloya said Kenyans should learn from the 2007 script which led to the loss of many lives, property and hurt the economy. “We have achieved much and we shouldn’t ruin what we have achieved because of a one-day event of just selecting who to lead us,” he said. Sloya said it has been a trend that the country has to go to internal crisis during the transition, a move that has been drugging the nation back from its gains. “I am urging my supporters and other Kenyans to write a new history of peaceful transition,” he said. Sloya said in any competition there must be winners and losers and that should not make Kenyans hate each other. Sloya is in the race to succeed MP Alfred Agoi.​​ Edited by A.N
