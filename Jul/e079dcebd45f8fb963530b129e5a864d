Have you heard of this unconventional way to prepare cake using leftover yoghurt and lemons in your fridge? Replacing milk with creamy yoghurt helps keep baked pastries moist. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat the oven to moderate 160-180 degrees. Grease the baking pan and set it aside. Step 2 Mix the butter, lemon rind and sugar, adding one egg at a time until the batter is light and fluffy Step 3 In a large bowl, transfer the mixture and add coconut, wheat flour, lemon juice, self-rising flour and Yoghurt. Stir thoroughly until evenly mixed. Step 4 Spread the mixture in the greased pan and bake for 50 minutes. Step 5 In a pan over medium heat, combine the lemon rind, squeezed lemon juice, water, honey and cardamom until the honey melts. Remove from heat and discard the cardamom pods. Step 6 Pour the syrup over the hot cake after baking. Sprinkle desiccated coconut for extra flavour. Step 7 Refrigerate or cool, then serve and enjoy with a cold cocktail.
