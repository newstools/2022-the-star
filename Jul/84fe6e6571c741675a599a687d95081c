When baking, many of us usually have high hopes that everything will turn out well but that is often not the case. The good news is the recipe is usually to blame, so your failures have no bearing on your ability to bake. Here are a few mistakes to avoid in order to get the best cookies for your family and friends. Biscuits generally feel soft in the oven and become firmer when cold. To test if a biscuit is cooked, push it gently with your finger, if it can move on the oven tray without breaking it is cooked. Burnt cookies If your cookies turned out too hard, you may have measured the ingredients incorrectly or your biscuits have been baked for too long at high temperatures. Spread on the tray The mixture was too soft due to over beating the mixture. Another reason could have been you used the wrong flour. Cookies are mostly baked with plain flour and not self rising. Alternatively, it could be that the oven was not hot enough to set the mixture correctly. Too soft The ingredients used may have been measured incorrectly. Biscuits have not been baked enough or have been softened by steam when stacked on top of each other. Try and space them out correctly in the baking tray. Too brown underneath If your cookies have browned underneath you probably over-greased your tray. This causes the oven heat to be attracted to the biscuits base. Next time, try using a pastry brush to grease your tray more lightly and evenly. An incorrect oven position and high temperature can also cause over-browning; over-generous measuring of ingredients like sugar, honey, or golden syrup can provoke the same issue. When baking, balance is key, try not to overdo the ingredients, you can use baking paper and a measuring scale. Try not to undermix or overmix your dough. If you find it hard to estimate, get or follow a recipe from a cook book.
