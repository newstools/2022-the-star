Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has hit out at the UDA presidential candidate William Ruto telling him he is not interested in his job offer. Kalonzo dismissed Ruto for his remarks during his lower Eastern region, where he claimed the former Vice President has been lied to by Raila Odinga. "Yesterday (Friday) he angrily talked a lot about his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta telling him to leave him alone. Now I want to tell Ruto, please leave Kalonzo alone," he said while speaking during campaigns in Narok on Saturday. Kalonzo told the DP to focus on hunting for his votes without mentioning his name. He said all he wants is for Kenyans to benefit as a whole, from the next government. "Not just about Kalonzo benefitting . He has been saying that I was lied to, I was sidelined. Pilipili usiyo kula yakuwashia nini?"he posed. On July 19, while addressing residents in Kitui, Kalonzo's home, Ruto said he regretted Kalonzo's treatment in Azimio, saying he will save him. "I know Kalonzo does not like me but it is not for any other reason, he has been incited by that man (Raila), why can’t you allow me to save this man?” Ruto asked. "This government we are going to form we will give him a job. He has suffered long enough," he said during campaigns in Makindu on July 20. On Saturday, in Kitui, Ruto repeated the same sentiments saying he will save the Ukambani kingpin if he wins the presidency on August 9.
