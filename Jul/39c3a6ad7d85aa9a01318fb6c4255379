Confusion has rocked City Hall after Finance executive Allan Igambi reversed the decision to change the name of the officer mandated with withdrawal rights at the Central Bank of Kenya. This comes a day after Governor Ann Kananu reshuffled chief officers at City Hall which saw the removal of Mohamed Sahal as Finance chief officer. He was replaced by Joseph Gathiaka, who is still the head of Treasury at City hall. The change meant that withdrawal rights at CBK had to be changed from Sahal to Gathiaka which was done by Igambi. However, in a new twist, Igambi on Wednesday wrote again to the CBK recalling his first letter of request of withdrawing right for Sahal. “We have today submitted withdrawal rights for Mohamed Abdi Sahal to your esteemed office. After  considering  internal logistical and administrative challenges we will face with this change, we would like to recall the forms and maintain status quo,” reads the letter addressed to director Banking Division at CBK. “We will in the course of the day submit other forms in support of this request and do kindly in the meantime request that no changes are done,” it read further. The person given the withdrawal rights is supposed to be recognised at CBK in order for the county to receive any release of funds. With the confusion of who between Gathiaka and Sahal has withdrawal rights, it is likely that City Hall will face a financial crisis.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
