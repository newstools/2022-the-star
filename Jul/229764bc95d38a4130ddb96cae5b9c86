Actor Shaniqwa's estranged baby mama Naomi Jemutai alias Mkale Msungu has introduced a new bae to her fans days after she announced she welcomed baby number two. Through her Instagram page, Jemutai shared a photo of an unidentified man holding a baby, praising him for making her a better person. "You are a wonderful person and I want you to know that I appreciate every little thing about you," she wrote. "All the work we did together was a blast and I hope to continue experiencing so many adventures with you. Nakulombotov." Shaniqwa went public about his bitter separation from his then-wife Naomi in an interview last year. The two dragged each other through the mud online, with each accusing the other about the actual source of the breakdown of their once-blissful union. According to reports, Jemutai is dating a city DJ identified as DJ Sliqboy. While introducing her child to her fans, Jemutai gushed over her man. On his Instagram page, the popular DJ also shared the same photo, welcoming him to the world. "Welcome to the world son, Prince AJ. Daddy loves you. Today is undoubtedly the happiest day of my life!"
