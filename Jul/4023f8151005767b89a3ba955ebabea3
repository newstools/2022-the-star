Carrot cake is cake that contains carrots mixed into the batter. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, which is essential for eye health and good vision. Eating carrots in moderation is good for you and incorporating it in your cake can be a good way to switch up your baking. Preparation: Step 1 In a large bowl mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to blend together. Step 2 Using a grater, grate the carrots until shredded. Add to a bowl then add white sugar, eggs and using a food processor, blend until combined. Step 3 Pour the wet mixture onto the dry ingredients, using a spatula to scrape as much of the mixture as you can from the food processor. Step 4 Whisk dry ingredients and wet ingredients together until combined. Expect a thick mixture. Step 5 Fold the carrots into the batter using your spatula. Then distribute batter evenly between 2 loaf pans. Step 6 Bake for about 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs. Wait to cool and serve with your favourite beverage.
