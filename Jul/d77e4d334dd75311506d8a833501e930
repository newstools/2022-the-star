Fish fillet is a must, for a chilled-out weekend with friends and family. A fillet is a boneless cut or slice of meat or fish. Fish is loaded with important nutrients, such as protein, Omega3 and vitamin D. Ingredients For the sauce For the fillet 2 thin white fish fillets (120-150g / 4-5oz each), skinless boneless (I used Bream, Note 1) Salt and pepper 2 tbsp white flour Vegetable oil Preparation Step 1 Place the butter in a pan and melt it over medium heat. Step 2 Add lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper then stir. Step 3 Pat the fish fillet dry using paper towels. Then sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Rub in flour on both sides. Step 4 In another pan, add oil, then fry the fish over medium heat. Remove from heat, serve, and drizzle with the sauce. Enjoy with a slice of lemon wedges and mashed potatoes or fries.
