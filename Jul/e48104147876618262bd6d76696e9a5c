Trans Nzoia Governor has accused some leaders in the region of curtailing his development track record which made it hard to deliver on his promises. Speaking during the official launch of the Kitale bus park and the Kitale business centre, Patrick Khaemba said his  administration has however done the best that could be done in terms of development. "There are some leaders from this region who derailed our development agenda by blocking some of the requests we had made to the national government with the aim of making us appear non-development conscious," he said. Governor Khaemba cited political interference by the said leaders who allegedly sponsored numerous court cases as the main stumbling block that derailed his urban planning agenda for the Kitale Municipality, among other sectors. “For instance, President Uhuru Kenyatta had allocated the Medium prison land but that required degazettement to become a reality. National leaders from this region failed to help drive this agenda through," he said. The governor also called on those who are eyeing his seat to conduct their campaigns in a peaceful manner instead of raising unnecessary tension, saying the cosmopolitan county requires cohesiveness for development to thrive. "I call on whoever will take over after my tenure to work with everyone to promote cohesion. I am  happy that no tension has been witnessed among communities residing in this region since I did not govern with an iron fist." Khaemba said he would soon open doors to the public to have a tour in the Kitale Teaching and Referral Hospital whose construction is ongoing to rest claims that the project was genuine. “Friday will be an open day for all residents to tour the facility. We have had funding challenges which majorly derailed our development agenda during my term in office,” the county boss said.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
