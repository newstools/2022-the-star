A viral video that emerged on June 25, showed Roots Party Presidential candidate George Wajackoyah saying there was a plan to bribe him Sh200m to quit the presidential race. While making the allegations, Wajackoyah did not reveal those who attempted to bribe him. He, however, said he turned the offer down and insisted he will remain on the ballot till the end. “Recently they came to my place and said that this Wajackoyah, why don’t we just pay him Sh200 million so that he can drop his bid,” Wajackoyah said in a viral video. “I looked at them and told them that I am the most learned man in Africa and I cannot be compromised. I have worked in higher places like the United Kingdom and I can never betray the cause of young people.” Wajackoya's remarks have however been misinterpreted otherwise by a section of Kenyans. Some have claimed that it is Deputy President William Ruto who attempted to bribe him to quit the race. The fact-checker has however established that the claims are misleading as the Roots party candidate did not say something like that.
