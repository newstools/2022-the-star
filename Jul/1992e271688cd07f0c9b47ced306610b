During this cold season, flu and colds run rampant so adding ginger to your soups can be a great way to boost immunity while also getting the best of flavours. Many people take turmeric and ginger at the first sign of sickness, hoping to enhance immune function and sidestep cold or flu symptoms. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Heat the olive oil in a large pan. Add the onions, carrots, and squash. Sauté for 3 - 5 minutes until the veggies start to soften. Step 2 Add the garlic, ginger, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Sauté for a few more minutes before adding the broth and coconut milk. Bring the mixture to boil, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Step 3 Once the soup is cooked, add it to a blender and blend until creamy. You can also use an immersion blender. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking. Step 4 Serve immediately with a dollop of coconut yogurt and enjoy with your favourite bread.
