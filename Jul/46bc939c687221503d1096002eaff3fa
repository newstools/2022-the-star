Two women found guilty of forging academic credentials were Tuesday jailed for a cumulative six years with an option of paying fines. Pauline Otieno and Lilian Ochieng were found guilty of forging certificates to get employment. "Pauline forged a Certificate in Procurement from Mount Kenya University while Lilian forged both a Diploma and Certificate from the Kenya Institute of Management," the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission said in a statement. The two-faced five criminal charges among them forgery, providing false information to a public entity,  deceiving a public entity, uttering a false document and fraudulent acquisition of public property being the cumulative salary earned on forged certificates. Otieno is facing two years and six months in prison if he fails to pay Sh228,698 fine. Ochieng will spend three years and six months in jail if he does not pay a Sh271,901 fine. They were also ordered to refund all the salary earned on the fake certificates. EACC said the two were employed at the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation in 2018. Investigations revealed that before formal employment, they had worked in the Corporation for eight years as casual employees. They were formally employed as Supplies Assistants after forging the said academic certificates. "Prior to investigations, they had served for two months,"EACC said.
