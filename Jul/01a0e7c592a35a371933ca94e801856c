Garissa High Court has nullified the candidature of one Mohamed Subey Gedi who was seeking the parliamentary position of Fafi Constituency in Garissa County. Lady Justice Abida Aroni ordered IEBC to degazette Subey after finding out that he holds citizenship in three countries; America, Kenya and Somalia. "The 1st Respondent is not qualified to run for the position of Member of Parliament for Fafi Constituency," she ruled. Aroni pointed out that the Constitution Under Article 78 (1) states that a person is not eligible for election to a State office unless the person is a citizen of Kenya. The order came after the residents of Fafi went to Court challenging the electoral body's decision to clear Subey. Aroni also ordered the IEBC to ensure that Subey does not participate in the forthcoming elections as a candidate. She further said Subey holding three citizenships was a matter of national securing, adding that the Constitution only allowed dual-citizenship. Subey was contesting for the seat against the incumbent MP Abdikain Osman of Jubilee, Mohamed Diis Shafat (Kanu) and UDA's  Salah Yakub.
