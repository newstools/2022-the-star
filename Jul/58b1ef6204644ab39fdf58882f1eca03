Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has promised Nairobi residents improved living standards should he win the August 9 polls. Speaking on Saturday during a series of rallies within the city, Raila said he is aware that rising cost of living has become a major problem to Kenyans but he has a grand plan to reverse the sorry state of affairs. "Najua gharama ya maisha imepanda sana...hayo yote tunajua lakini penye nia pana njia," Raila said. (I'm aware the cost of living has gone up, but where there is a will there is a way) Raila was accompanied by his running mate Martha Karua and Nairobi governor aspirant Polycarp Igathe. The Azimio team was on the first day of its two-day campaign blitz in Nairobi county. They had several stops including at Dagoretti Market and Satellite Shopping Centre, Stage Two and 56 and Mau Mau and Kangemi. The team also visited Starehe in Nairobi Southward and Landi Mawe, Kamukunji and at the Tumaini Grounds in Embakasi West. Karua said the solution to the rising cost of living lies in electing leaders with integrity who would in turn take good care of public funds. "We must take good care of public funds to be able to help you. When few embezzle your funds and come disguised as frineds to share a portion with you, we won't be able to give you good service," Karua said. Under the Azimio manifesto, Raila has pledged to give every household Sh6,000 monthly stipend to cushion them against economic hardship should he win the August election. The ODM leader faces stiff competition from UDA presidential candidate William Ruto even as recent opinion polls have given Raila an edge over the Deputy President.
