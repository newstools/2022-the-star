To meet the growing demand for men seeking services for male related medical issues, the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, has opened an Andrology Centre at the Hospital’s Peponi Executive Clinic. The centre will focus on male reproduction, hormone and organ concerns, including erectile dysfunction, male fertility, prostrate disease, premature ejaculation, penile and testicular cancers. It will be run by Dr Ahmed Yousef, a consultant urologist who recently successfully performed the first penile implant in the region. “There is need for increased awareness for men to seek help for their reproductive health issues the same way women are quick to visit a gynaecologist when the need arises,” he said. “The clinic will provide a friendly environment for men to openly discuss problems with a specialist.” Dr Yousef said infertility is a major concern, and the centre will offer diagnostic tests, such as semen analysis, to check the volume, number, ability, size of sperms, among other tests. It shall also carry out testicular biopsies, which help to check whether there are issues with sperm production and assist in determining the cause of other andrology issues, such as a lump in the testicles, or to diagnose testicular cancer. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is another common concern when a man is unable to have an erection, or to sustain the erection long enough to have sex. The facility will deal with diagnosis and treatment of ED and can also perform penile transplants for those suffering from severe ED, having tried other treatment options without success.
