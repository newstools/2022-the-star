Keroche Breweries has filed an application against the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and Commissioner General Githii Mburu for disregarding a High Court order to re-open the plant. Through H&K law advocates, the firm filed the application at the High Court on Friday under the certificate of urgency. The firm noted that High Court Judge Alfred Mabeya had on July 14, 2022, issued an order directing KRA to reopen the brewer but the tax agency moved to court on July 18 to seek an order to stop the reopening. According to Keroche’s lawyers, Lady Justice Abigael Mshilla did not certify KRA’s application not to reopen the brewer and no orders were issued regarding the said application.
