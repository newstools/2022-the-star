World 5,000 silver medallist Margaret Chelimo will be aiming to go one place better in the final of the event on Saturday in Eugene, Oregon Chelimo, who won bronze in the 10,000m race, will lead a Kenyan trio that includes the former world under 20 champion Beatrice Chebet and Gloria Kite. The trio qualified for the final in contrasting styles with Chebet placing third in 14:53.34 with Chelimo fourth in 14:53.45 in Heat One. Gloria Kite finished sixth in 14:53.62 in Heat Two. Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay topped Heat One in 14:52.64 as compatriot Dawit Seyaum placed second in 14:53.06 Chelimo said taking the bronze in the 10,000m has given her confidence about her prospects in the 12-lap race. "It will be a tough race but I am confident with the form I am in. We are ready to go all the way and do the country proud,” she said. Chelimo said she expects a tough battle with the Ethiopian trio of world 10,000m champion Letsenebet Gidey, Gudaf Tsegay, and Dawit Seyaum in what is expected to be a hotly contested race. Chelimo said they will come up with a plan to counter the threat posed by the Ethiopians. “We know they are strong finishers and we must keep up with them in the race if we are to win medals,” noted Chelimo. She said she also expects a tough test from Olympic 5,000m champion Sifan Hasan who finished third in her heat in 14:52.89. “She is a strong athlete and we competed with her in the 10,000 final. Having missed on the podium in the 10,000m, I know she will fight tooth and nail in the 5,000m at least not to return home empty-handed. We relish the challenge of competing against her and the rest of the competition,” she asserted. The former All Africa Games champion said teamwork will be key if they are to fly the country's flag high. We worked well with Helen Obiri in the 10km and we need to do the same in Saturday's 5km race,” she added. Chelimo said they have adjusted accordingly to the searing temperatures in Oregon and feel they are good to go. Kenya has won the title four times with Vivian Cheruiyot winning twice in 2009 in Berlin and 2011 in Daegu and defending champion Hellen Obiri winning in 2017 in London and 2019 (Doha).
