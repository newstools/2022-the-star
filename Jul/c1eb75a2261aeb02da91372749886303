President Uhuru Kenyatta has officially commissioned the Nairobi Expressway. The Expressway had been closed on Saturday following a lapse in the trial period. The commissioning now means the project is available for public use. The Moja Expressway Company, which manages the road said the road will be available for use once it is officially launched. While launching the project, Uhuru said the project is a fundamental overhaul of how government can use the PPP model to bridge infrastructure deficits. "Hongera to all who made this masterpiece a success and for the government and the people of Kenya for having confidence in our infrastructure projects," he said. "Our gratitude goes to CRBC for choosing to invest and demonstrate their confidence in our country."
