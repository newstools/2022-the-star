A brawl over an unpaid bill at a bar in Roysambu, Nairobi, prompted a gun drama and the loss of a pistol magazine loaded with 15 bullets. But a man who returned the magazine hours later was detained by police for questioning. Two police officers attached to Jogoo police station and Kileleshwa police station had gone to Paris Lounge and Grill in Mirema area, Roysambu, on Monday evening for some refreshment when a fight broke out over who was to settle the Sh1,200 bill. This was after the bar management demanded payment of the bill after the revelers had had some food and drinks. Witnesses and police said disagreement over the bill ensued on Tuesday morning leading to a fight between the officers, some revelers and the club’s security. Police officers from Kasarani Police Station rushed to the scene on being informed of the drama. It was then that they realized some of their colleagues were among those in the scuffle and one of them complained his magazine was missing. This was after he was disarmed by security officials at the joint. It was in the process that he lost the loaded magazine of his Ceska pistol. Witnesses said the officer was disarmed after he threatened to shoot during the scuffle. Police said during the scuffle, the said officer sustained head injuries. The pistol was recovered and kept at the station armoury for safe custody as police searched for the lost magazine. And on Wednesday, a man who works at the lounge found the magazine and took it to Kasarani Police station and was immediately placed in custody to assist with investigations. The man told police he was an employee of a shisha joint within Paris Lounge and that he found the magazine in the compound of the lounge while on his way home and returned it at around 10 am. Police said the injured officer plans to file assault charges against the bar security. Investigations into the incident are ongoing.
