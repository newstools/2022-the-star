Moving The Goal Post women's football team are looking to sign players with Premier League experience to help the coastal side maintain their top-flight status at the end of the 2022-23 season. MTG on Sunday sealed a grand return to the top-flight league after a 2-1 win over Gideon Starlets FC in the playoffs at the Nakuru Showground. They join Kibera Soccer and Royal Starlets in the 12-team WPL in the coming season. The Kilifi-based side will be the only women’s team from the coastal region that will feature in the top-tier league next season. Plans are underway to strengthen the squad, according to coach Jonathan Mashe. "We are going to beef up all positions if we are to have a realistic chance of maintaining to status in the league," Mashe began. "We need the bench power and players with proven league records. We will also cast our scouting nets to the Division One league which I believe has quality players to thrive in the top tier. MTG are returning to the league after 13 years in the lower tier. With the league unified and the team expected to travel as far as Vihiga, finances are likely to be a hindrance. Mashe is, however, hopeful that the next government will support the team financially to avoid walkovers that have dented the reputation of the league. "We are the pride of the coast. We hope those in the next leadership will invest in sports. Teams like Vihiga, Gaspo and Ulinzi have the perfect model and I would like to borrow from the trio."
