Agano party leader David Mwaure has hit out at his opponents, saying they could have implemented their manifestos earlier. He said DP William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga of Azimio have been in the public offices in the past but they have done nothing. "They have been there before. One of them has been and is still the Deputy President of this Republic. He is the government," he said. "The things he is saying he can do are things he could have done these last 10 years, 20 or 30 years because he is been in government that long and he has not done so." Mwaure said Raila, who served as a Prime Minister and the people's president, had enough time to make real the plan he has been selling to Kenyans. "He has been a co-president if you wish, sharing the government 50-50. The things he is promising are things he could have done." At the same time, he said Wajackoyah worked in the intelligence service and also had the opportunity to change the country. Mwaure further lashed out at Ruto, claiming that the government he is currently part of, has been involved in almost 22 known scandals. On Raila, he alleged that during the time he served in the government, there were about 12 scandals. "And they have been there... And the final one, you have worked in government, you have travelled across the world. You must know something about our funds which are stashed abroad," he added.
