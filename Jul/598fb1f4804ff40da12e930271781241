Kenya Rugby Union Championship side Kisumu RFC are targeting a return to the Kenya Cup in the 2023-2024 season. Club secretary Jaycox Mwavali said the club will only play in the Championship next season. The club has advertised for the position of head coach, whose main deliverable will be to guide the club back to the Kenya Cup. The club was relegated to the KRU Championship in 2020 alongside neighbours Western Bulls. Last season, the club finished 8th in the regular KRU Championship season to miss out on promotion. Instead, Catholic Monks and Mean Machine were promoted to Kenya Cup, replacing Nondies and Impala Saracens. The incoming coach will replace Ugandan Brian Makalama. Mwavali, however, said Makalama is free to reapply for the position. He said they are looking for a coach with a minimum of three years of coaching experience. “The coach must have Level II World Rugby qualifications and demonstrate high ethical standards and integrity. Being in possession of relevant World Rugby certification in strength and conditioning will be an added advantage,” said Mwavali. Prospective candidates have until Saturday to apply for the position. Mwavali added that the club has already identified some prospective signings and they are still hunting for more. He, however, added that the head coach will assess the squad and make necessary recommendations. “The coach will be given a free hand when it comes to signing players,” added Mwavali, when he spoke to the Star on Wednesday.
