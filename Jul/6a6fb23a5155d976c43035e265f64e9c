With only 32 days to the August 9 polls, Gatudu South MP Moses Kuria has yet again kicked a storm in Kiambu county. This is after he chided the UDA party in Kiambu accusing them of hatching a plot to fight his seemingly growing popularity in the region. Kuria who is eyeing the governor's seat in the August 9 polls on his CCK party ticket claimed on Thursday that he is being targeted by the Deputy President William Ruto-led party. He claimed the group has suspended campaigns to chart the way forward on who they can boost the odds for their governor candidate Kimani Wamatangi. Both CCK and the UDA party are members of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. "This game is becoming interesting. The entire UDA brigade in Kiambu County has suspended their campaigns in 12 constituencies to shore up Wamatangi's faltering campaigns and fight one Moses Kuria, not Azimio," he wrote. The latest outburst by Kuria is one of the many tirades he has launched against the UDA party and Wamatangi as they wrestle for the control of the vote-rich county. UDA party is keen on exerting its authority on the Mt Kenya region by sweeping clean a majority, if not all, of the elective seats in the Mt Kenya region. However, fringe parties such Kuria's CCK have put a spirited fight for a fair share of elective seats. On June 20, Kuria accused Ruto's camp of deceit and sidelining in the Mt Kenya region politics. The CCK leader claimed that the UDA leaders were plotting against other leaders. This came after a standoff between Wamatangi and former governor William Kabogo, at a rally in Kiambu on June 15. The aftermath of the brawl saw Kabogo quit the UDA campaigns and consequently went mum on campaigning for Ruto's presidency. In an interview with a local station, the Governor did not align himself with any camp. He said he is now focused on his gubernatorial ambitions only.
