The lawn bowls team are targeting to go past the group stages during the Commonwealth Games set to start next week in Birmingham. Team manager, Mumo Musembi said they have a lot of confidence in the team of four that was named from a pool of 30 players. "But as much as we believe they will post good results, we still need to work on a number of aspects in order to be in the right gear," he noted. Musembi added: "Initially, we had a provisional list of 30 players that was reduced to 10 before we came up with the final four on June 15." He said their main mission in Birmingham was to try and qualify for the knockout stages. "We have been competing in Commonwealth since 1998 and we are yet to make the knockout stages," Musembi said. He added: "Two of the four were in Gold Coast for the 2018 Commonwealth Games and missed out by a very short margin to  make the cut to quarters." He said the fact that they beat South Africa, who have won multiple  Commonwealth gold medals raised Musembi's hopes ahead of the forthcoming games. "In the last competition in Africa, we defeated the South African singles champion and this means we are able to play at the top level. However, we still need to put a bit of investment to get to the top table,” he said. Cephas Kimwaki and Eunice Mbugua are among the selected players and feel they are ready for the competition. “I am ready for the competition because we have been training consistently,” Mwaki said.
