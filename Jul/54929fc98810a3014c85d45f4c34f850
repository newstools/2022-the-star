Boniface Mwangi faced a team of comedians armed with brutal and hilarious roasts aimed at him at Roast House. This is the first comedy TV show of its kind in Kenya, and it is streaming on Showmax. At the roast, Mwangi was accompanied by his wife Njeri Mwangi and his musician and activist friend Juliani. Boniface’s activism woes earned him a fair share of roasts from the comedians taking the stage, with Justine Wanda delivering one of the most brutal roasts of the night. “Bonnie’s entire activism career is basically political BDSM. He keeps going back for more because he loves it... Sorry, he loves us.” Comedian John Ribia said, "Lilian gave up the prestige, the tenders, the titles, Konza technology city, the F1 track, just to be with her love Juliani, and their lovely third wheel Bonnie.” Even his wife Njeri caught a few stray bullets. “We were told categorically not to speak about Bonnie’s wife Njeri, and now that I see her hairstyle, I can understand why,” Bashir Yusuf joked, alluding to the infamous Oscar moment between Will Smith and Chris Rock. Doug, who is also the Stand-Up Collective co-founder, singled out the Roast of Boniface Mwangi as one of the most exciting ones. “The man has fodder for days and being one of the first few ones, we knew he could take it as he has dealt with worse things. For us, it meant it would be a no-holds-barred session,” Doug said. Recorded live at Number 7 Club on Koinange Street, Nairobi, the show is co-produced by Eugene Mbugua’s D&R Studios. Eugene said, “Roast House is funny, brutal, honest and a mirror reflection of our society, and that reflection is sometimes not pretty.”
