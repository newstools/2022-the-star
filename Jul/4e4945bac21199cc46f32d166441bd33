The electoral commission, on Monday launched an 18-day voter sensitisation campaign in preparation for the August 9 general election. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has acquired 14 vehicles that will traverse the country and sensitise the public with voter education messages. Director of Voter Registration and Electoral Operations, Rasi Masudi, said the campaign will start in Nairobi where four caravan trucks will traverse the county before joining the rest in Kisumu, Nakuru and Mombasa cities. "The caravan will engage voters and answer any queries within the four cities and several towns along 13 regional roads across the country," Masudi said. "Each caravan will have IEBC staff led by County Election Managers and all other stakeholders," he added. The vehicles were flagged off by the IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati at the Kenyan International Conference Centre (KICC) in Nairobi. The exercise coincided with the second and last day of the National Election Conference 2022 at the Kenyatta Convention Centre. The conference themed 'Moving Kenya Towards a Stronger Democracy' seeks to assess Kenya’s preparedness towards a fair, peaceful and credible election.
