Tanzanian singer Loui has dropped his much-anticipated single called 'Hennessy Remix'. Speaking about the song, Loui said he had been looking forward to this release with great excitement. "We’ve all put so much work, time, and effort into this project, and I hope it gives you every reason to enjoy and replay this song throughout the summer season," he said. "I appreciate Kidi and Maud Elka for their support on this. This project wouldn’t have been possible without their creative input and dedication." Loui is signed under the United Stated-based independent record label Legacy Record Inc. The song comes a few weeks after he documented his music journey in an EP. "I did 'Hennessy' especially for the ladies, I was fantasising. It is a club banger, a party song," he said.
