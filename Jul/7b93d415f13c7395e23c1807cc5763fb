A man has been charged with defiling a minor aged 15 between August to December 2019 at Southlands Kijiji in Lang'ata, Nairobi. Victor Oduor Otieno denied the charges and was granted a Sh300,00 bond but he is still in custody. The girl had testified in court how the accused defiled her on several occasions. She said the first incident occurred while she was staying at the accused person’s house in Lang'ata. She told the court that one day when she was at Otieno's sister’s house he came and took her to his bedroom and defiled her. The girl told the court that the accused person’s sister never knew of the incident. She said on another day, the accused person came and attacked her claiming that she was putting on a jacket that belonged to another boy. “He told me that since I was his girlfriend he felt jealous seeing me putting on the jacket,” she said. She told the court the attack was witnessed by her mother who came to her aid. She said later she informed her the accused person had been defiling her. “My mother took me to the hospital later we reported the matter to the police,” she said. Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto directed that the case be heard next month. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
