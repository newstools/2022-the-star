Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru received defectors from other parties on Thursday. The defectors pledged to support her Gubernatorial bid under the United Democratic Alliance party (UDA) in the August 9 election. The supporters said they have been supporting candidates from other parties but decamped, realising the Governer was more articulate in her issues based political agenda. The group said they will now campaign in villages to ensure the UDA candidates win the election. Samwel Macharia, a resident in Mutira ward, said they made the decision after it became apparent that Deputy President William Ruto's Party was more popular in the region. His sentiments were echoed by another resident Loise Nyawira. " We have been in the political wilderness for too long but we have now seen light in our new political house," she said. Owen Ndege said he was confident the Governor will retain her seat , adding her development record was loudly speaking 'loudly' across the country. On her part, the Governor told the new supporters that DP Ruto's party will uplift the standards of common residents through a bottom up economic model. She said the UDA manifesto was best for the Kenya.
