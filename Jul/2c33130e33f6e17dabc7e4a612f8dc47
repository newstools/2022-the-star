YY Comedian's girlfriend Marya Okoth was discharged from a city hospital. The couple have been in and out of the hospital the past three weeks. This is after Marya developed a rare condition that caused her leg to go numb. The funny man shared a video of himself preparing a meal for his girlfriend, who can be seen resting in the background. He wrote, "After her discharge, all she wanted was bread and baked beans." Last week, the mother of one shared videos on her Instagram stories in an ambulance, and one where she was in a wheelchair. She added that her left leg had become insensitive due to a blood clot she had experienced in the past. "This is a great turning point in my life. I never thought a day would come when I'd be unable to walk totally."
