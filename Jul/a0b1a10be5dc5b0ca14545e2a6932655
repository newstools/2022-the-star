Singer Colonel Mustafa suffered depression after he left the popular reality show 'Nairobi Diaries'. In an interview on the Trend, Mustapha said things have been tough, which forced him to disappear a little from social media. He has not released a song for close to five years but is currently working on an album. "It's been five years since I released music. Now I am back," he said. "I had depression at some point, like two or three years after I left 'Nairobi Diaries' and things went bad." The 'Katika' hitmaker termed his relationship with Noti Flow chaotic. "I was not in peace and it got to a point I realised it was dragging me behind and my friends were no longer supporting me," he said. Noti Flow allegedly left the singer due to violence.
