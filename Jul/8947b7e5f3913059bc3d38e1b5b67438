A 40-year-old man was killed in a fire incident in his house in Makadara, Nairobi. The body of Ochieng Ochibo was discovered long after the fire had been contained. Police and witnesses said the victim was sleeping when the fire broke out on Tuesday morning burning down up to seven structures. Six other families were left without shelter. The remains were moved to the mortuary pending investigations into the cause of the fire, Nairobi police boss James Mugera said. He said another fire burnt down structures in California leaving at least ten families homeless. The cause of the fire is yet to be known. Police said no injury was reported but property was destroyed in the fire. The lack of response from the fire brigade in the city to such incidents has been a major concern to many. The fire engines are not insured which has grounded their operations. Officials at the County Government of Nairobi say they are working to solve a dispute between them and the insurer. Places affected by such incidents have in the past days been depending on private fire brigades to contain the same. Some of the brigades demand payments for the services rendered. This has exposed the city to many dangers in case of a tragedy. Officials say talks are ongoing to address the issue. Meanwhile, police are holding four men in connection with the recovery of four motorcycles that had been reported as stolen. The motorcycles were recovered in a house in Korogocho slums on Tuesday in a police operation. The four motorcycles are being detained as exhibits while the four were expected in court to face various charges, police said. Police have been advising boda boda operators to install trackers as part of efforts to stop cases of stealing of the same.
