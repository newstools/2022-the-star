Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has dismissed claims that he will fight Christianity once he takes over power. Speaking on Friday in Machakos, Raila said his remarks at a meeting with Muslim women were taken out of context. "I was just putting it in historical context. I did not want to use this against the Christianity of today." Addressing a group of Muslim women on Monday, Raila said it was wrong to perceive one region as more important than the other. "We will end Christian chauvinism. Our Constitution states that Kenya is a secular society and is a God-fearing nation and must respect all religions." He added that if elected, he will make sure all regions are protected equally. "I was addressing a group of Muslim women who came to see me. And were complaining about discrimination of Muslims when they apply for passports or ID cards," he said. Raila explained that when he was Lang'ata MP, he witnessed discrimination against members of the Islamic faith in the area. "When you want to get an ID card as a Muslim youth, you have to produce the ID of your father and of your grandfather. Sometimes they ask you also the grandfather of your father," he said. "They are not asking members of the other religion. That is what I said is discrimination." The ODM leader said this was brought about by colonialism. At the time, the Anglican church was the church of the Queen and the Governor, so it was favoured. He reiterated that the 2010 Constitution protects the church and all other religions. "We said we will protect the Constitution and by doing so, we will be protecting the rights of Christians as we also protect the rights of Hindus and Muslims," the former Prime Minister said. Raila added that he is a Christian, an Anglican, who respects the Constitution of Kenya and will ensure the Rights of all Kenyans are honoured, if elected.
