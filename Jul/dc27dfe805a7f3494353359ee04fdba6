Kenya Lionesses have been drawn against South Africa, Chile and China in Pool D ahead of next month's Challenger Sevens Series in Chile. The Lionesses, who had a dismal campaign during the Africa Sevens Championship in Tunisia in April, will be eyeing one automatic slot in the World Sevens Series in December. Head coach Dennis Mwanja believes he has a side capable of being competitive for the three-day event in South America. "Our preparations are going on well.  We have had time to analyze our errors during the continental event and we want to make the country proud," said Mwanja. Poland headline Pool 'E', where they face Belgium, Argentina and Papua New Guinea. Japan, who are favourites for the series, face fast-improving Kazakhstan, Colombia and Mexico. In the men's category, Africa Sevens champions Uganda have a date with Germany, Uruguay and Lithuania in Pool C. Runners-up Zimbabwe clash with Hong Kong, Tonga and Jamaica in Pool B as hosts Chile meet South Korea, Papua New Guinea and Georgia. Elsewhere, the Elgon Cup fixture pitting Uganda and Kenya scheduled for July 23 and 30 has been cancelled. The Kenya Rugby Union sent a letter to their Ugandan counterparts, saying Kenya would not be in a position to play both matches owing to the prevailing tough economic conditions and upcoming General Elections. Both teams were in action during the recent World Cup qualifiers held in France with the Simbas finishing second and the Ugandans finishing fifth overall.
