Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has challenged the church to strongly voice its objection when politicians preach hate or incite one community against another during the electioneering period. The church, he said, must also seek to heal wounds and conflict between communities and should not just sit back and watch. The county chief said many religious leaders opt to take a neutral stand, turning out to be just spectators in the entire electoral process. In the 90s, the church’s role in the Rwandan genocide came into sharp focus which was also the case in the 2007/08 post-election violence in Kenya. “When the character, content, voice and tone of the campaign seeks to erode the moral fabric of society, the church must take action,” he said. Muriithi, for instance, said the oxford dictionary defines the word ‘hustler’ as a person adept at illicit dealings and or a prostitute. “In the very least, the clergy must be wary of such references and shun using such labels on themselves and their congregations,” he advised. The governor spoke on Thursday as he campaigned in Gatundia, Sironi, Kiamaina, Manguo, Salama and Thome in the Laikipia West constituency. He was accompanied by other Jubilee Party candidates. Religious leaders, he also noted, have a moral obligation of assisting citizens to understand the agenda of various politicians. He said a governor’s manifesto is turned into a five-year county integrated development plan if he wins, as it is presumed he was elected because of a good policy. “All too often we are witnessing MCA candidates promising employment, MP candidates promising to improve agriculture and so on without a clue on how they might fulfil those promises,” he said. “The church must help the citizen separate truth from fiction, practical policy from pie in the sky.” He said manifestos are not just marketing tools but the basis of the social contract between the citizens and the government they elect.
