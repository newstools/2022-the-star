Wills Raburu's and Ivy Namu's son Mali turned a year old yesterday. The couple celebrated their son's birthday at a colourful event in which the media personality engaged his baby mama. In a post on Namu's Instagram, she wished her son a happy birthday. "I am so proud of being your mummy and I love you beyond words, my boy," she wrote. "You changed my life in the best of ways and I’m eternally grateful to have you as my son." Namu promised to give her son the best life. "May God continue to keep you happy and healthy. May he bless you abundantly, my cutie pie, and always show you favour and guide your path." Namu and Raburu are expecting their second child together.
