Teachers have been asked to be patient as Knut engages TSC to ensure that classroom teachers are considered in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Speaking at Sikusi in Kabuchai constituency on Saturday during the burial of former Bungoma Central Knut executive secretary Fred Sichangi, Kennedy Nyamwanda, Knut national treasurer urged TSC, the ministries of Education and Labour to ensure that teachers welfare are catered. He said the last agreement that was inked by TSC and Knut did not favour the classroom teachers, adding that this time the classroom teacher will be favoured in a deal that is yet to be signed by the TSC and other stakeholders. “AS a Knut official, I am unhappy how teachers are being treated. They are working in an unfair environment, and that is why I have taken an initiative as their leader to make noise so that their grievances are addressed,” the unionist said. Nyamwanda urged teachers to remain calm and back Knut efforts in fighting for their interests nationally. “I want all teachers to rally behind Knut to ensure that every teacher is aware of what is going on and ensure that their demands are sorted,” he said. John Wesonga, Western region Knut chairman, faulted the elected leaders for failing to fight for the interests of common mwananchi while at the assembly. He accused some politicians who during the campaigns pledge to support the education sector only to disappear after the election. Kenya Kwanza principal Moses Wetang’ula who was also present at the burial said that if the alliance takes over the government they will support education to ensure that teachers are working in a conducive environment. Wetang'ula argued that he has supported teachers welfare when he was government and as a senator.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
