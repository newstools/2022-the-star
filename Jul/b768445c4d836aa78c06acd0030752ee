Controversial singer KRG the Don and socialite Huddah Monroe were in Juba over the weekend. The two sparked dating rumours after he was spotted holding Huddah Monroe's hand in Juba. Speaking to Eve Mungai, KRG said he was there for business. "The show was fully booked, it was a VVIP show. It was a show arranged for 200 people then it was increased to 250," he said. The self-proclaimed millionaire did not reveal how much he was paid to entertain guests. Asked to speak about his relationship with Huddah, KRG said, "Let us wait for Huddah to come and answer that question because if I talk, I might say something I am not supposed to say." Huddah was previously linked to Tanzanian singer Juma Jux.
