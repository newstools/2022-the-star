Olympic and World 800 m champion Emmanuel Korir has dedicated his gold to Kenyans after a superb win at the World Championships in Oregon on Sunday. Korir, who powered his legs in the last 100m to win the country's second gold medal thanked Kenyans for their support. "I dedicate the medal to the Kenyans fans who have been supporting and praying for us in the course of the championships,” said Korir. The United States-based athlete, who trains under former Olympic 800m champion Paul Ereng, termed the final as one of the toughest he has ever raced in. "I was courageous. I knew everyone in the final was going to be tired after the heats and semifinal so I just kept pressing on and I won the race,” said Korir. The Olympic champion added: "I knew it was bound to be a tough race since I was the only one with a time of 1:45. The race played into my hands when it proved slow in the last 200m. I am happy to achieve a milestone here in Oregon." Korir said the 800m race has become the toughest on the track. "It's always difficult. You may make calculations that might work or not. The race can be fast or slow so you have to position  yourself well,” noted Korir. He said he had learned  lessons from the 2017 and 2019 World Championships in London and Doha respectively. "I didn't perform well in London 2017 and messed up my chances when I doubled up in 400m and 800m in Doha 2019," he observed. Korir joins world record holder David Rudisha as the only other Kenyans to win an Olympic and world title in a span of one year. Algeria's Djamel Sedanti bagged silver in 1:44.14 with Marco Arop of Canada took the bronze medal in 1:44.28 Meanwhile, world 5,000m silver medallist Beatrice Chebet has set her sights on winning gold at next year's event in Budapest. Chebet said she will work on her speed after coming second in the 12 and a half lap race as she clocked 14:46.75. Ethiopia took gold courtesy of 1500m runner Gudaf Tsegay posting 14:46:29 and Dawit Seyaum taking bronze in 14:47.36. "I really need to work on my speed for next year," said Chebet. Chebet thanked former 5000m champion Helen Obiri for mentoring her, saying: "She has really helped me and am grateful for her support."
