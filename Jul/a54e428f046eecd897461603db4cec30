Deputy President William Ruto has asked residents of Bumula constituency in Bungoma to elect either Mwambu Mabonga of his UDA party or Augustine Luketelo of Ford Kenya as their MP. Speaking at Kimwanga market during the Kenya Kwanza campaign rally on Monday, Ruto asked Bumula electors to reject DAP-K candidate Jack Wamboka and pick a Kenya Kwanza candidate. He said he wants an MP whom he will work with to develop the region. “I want you to give me either Mwambu or Luketelo who understands the bottom-up economic model so that we can work together and better your lives here in Bumula,” Ruto said. The DP said he had previously worked with MP Mwambu to fund small business operators. On improving business, Ruto pledged to invest Sh50 billion to help small business operators so they can pay taxes with ease and feed their families. Ruto also promised to build more technical training institutes in the region if he wins the election. The DP dismissed opinion polls showing Azimio la Umoja presidential aspirant Raila Odinga is ahead. He said Kenyans will decide who will be the next president on August 9. Ruto urged Kenyans to participate peacefully in the upcoming election. Others seeking the Bumula MP seat include former MP Bifwoli Wakoli (independent) and former MP Benjamin Osiula also independent.
