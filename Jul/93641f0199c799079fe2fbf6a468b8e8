Kenya Simbas face the moment of truth as they face champions Namibia with 2023 Rugby World Cup qualification on the line on Sunday at the Stade Maurice David in Aix en Province in France. Paul Odera's charges made light work of neighbours Uganda in their quarterfinal, winning 42-0 last weekend but were given the fight of their lives in Wednesday's semifinal against Algeria, winning by the skin of their teeth 36-33. Namibia, who have represented Africa for the past six editions of rugby's biggest prize, thrashed Burkina Faso 71-5 before overcoming a stubborn Zimbabwe 34-19 in the semifinals on Wednesday. The two sides have met 13 times with the Southern Africa giants winning 10 times in a rivalry that started during the 1995 Rugby World Cup qualifiers held in Nairobi with Kenya losing 60-9. Their highest-ever win over Kenya, 84-12, came in 2006. Eight of those matches have been played in Windhoek, Namibia's capital with the hosts winning 32-10 and 38-10 in 2003. In 2004, the side known as Weltwitchias, won yet again in a 65-7 demolition. Kenya's two wins came in 2006 in Nairobi, winning 30-26 at the RFUEA ground and at the 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifiers held in Madagascar where the Simbas emerged victorious 29-22. The two foes did not meet for seven years but resumed their hostilities in 2013, where the Namibians triumphed 55-35. The results in subsequent matches have seen Namibia win 45-13 in 2015, 56-21 in 2016, 45-7 in 2017, and in the last World Cup qualifying campaign in 2018, they defeated the Simbas 53-28. The two rivals last met in November during the Quadrangular series played in Stellenbosch in South Africa and the Namibians came out tops, winning 60-24. Olympians Collins Injera and Vincent Onyala, who missed the semifinal victory over Algeria will return for the blockbuster showdown. Paul Odera's charges had a light training session on Friday as they looked at improving set-piece and defence for this eagerly anticipated encounter. Odera said the team must stay in the contest from the first whistle, mimimise penalties at the breakdown and be competitive at setpieces. Odera will rely on Parick Ouko, Eugene Sifuna and Ephraim Oduor in the front row with Malcolm Onsando and Thomas Okeyo in the engine room. Dan Sikuta, George Nyambua and Bethwell Anami are in the back row. Samuel Asati, who has been outstanding in the qualifiers dons the number nine jersey and partners Dominic Coulson in the halfbacks. Top try scorer John Okoth will continue his partnership with Onyala in midfield while Injera, Jacob Ojee and Darwin Mukidza complete the back three. The winner qualifies for next year's Rugby World Cup in Pool 'A' that has hosts France, three-time champions New Zealand and Italy. The loser heads to the repechage in November alongside three other teams.
