Migori residents will benefit from Sh1.8 billion Kenya Water Institute campus which will be built in Nyabera, Uriri subcounty. Kennedy Riaga, the institute's chief executive officer, said the project will be completed in three years and it will be financed by African Development Banka and Chinese Exim Bank. “The government is expected to fund the consultancy fee for the entire project and it will start after the community has accepted it and donated land,” Riaga said. He spoke on Saturday at Nyabera during public participation and feasibility tour. “Our strategic direction as of now is to move to all other areas to make education accessible to all Kenyans,” Riaga said. He said their mandate was to train and conduct research in water-related fields. The institute offers various programmes varying from diploma to certificate level and artisan in water-related fields. They include a diploma in water engineering courses and water resource management and a certificate in both programmes. They offer artisan courses for those taking plumbing and pipe fitting and prior learning modules for those who have the basics of plumbing and didn’t go through formal education. They also have a continual basis of training for those who left the institute earlier to get updated on the recent technology in the market. “The residents agreed to have 29 acres of land be used in the establishment of the institution,” he said. Fisheries Aquaculture and Blue Economy PS Francis Owino said the establishment of the campus is a project that has huge social implications for the community. “We will offer job opportunities for community members, open the economy and will bridge the skills gap that is in the water sector by training people in water-related fields,” Owino said.
