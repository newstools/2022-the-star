Microsoft is working on a smaller and faster Outlook Lite application that will be rolled out in the Google Play store later this month. As per Microsoft’s 365 road map, the lite Outlook version of the application will be “an Android app that brings the main benefits of Outlook in a smaller app size with performance for low-end devices on any network.” The original version is available for both iOS and Android phones. Outlook was one of the most popular email clients on Android but has been dwarfed by Gmail over the years. Microsoft says, the application will be limited to Outlook, Hotmail, Live, and MSN accounts and will not support Gmail or Yahoo email accounts. It will support adding and using only one email account. Microsoft is also testing a new Outlook system for Windows Application that will eventually replace the Outlook for windows app in the coming years.
