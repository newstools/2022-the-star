West Mugirango MP hopeful Stephen Mogaka has vowed to ensure he saves tea and coffee farmers from exploitation by brokers and agencies. He said farmers have been ignored since they have nobody to defend them and there is a need for a leader who can stand up and fight for them. Mogaka spoke in Nyamira town on Monday when he met tea farmers' representatives from various centres and factories. He promised to ensure they are well represented in the national assembly and their grievances addressed. The city-based lawyer accused the current leadership saying they have failed to represent tea farmers and hence should pave way for someone willing to do the work. “We have leaders in the region but we are worried that the challenges we face as tea farmers have not been debated at the national assembly.” Mogaka said that even though tea is sold across the globe, the responsible agencies pay farmers peanuts without putting into consideration what they go through to get the tea to the processing factory. He said other regions are getting relatively high pay than in Gusii because leaders in other regions have stood with their farmers hence their voice is heard. He said in the Gusii region, tea farmers are just taken for a ride when it comes to payment of dues. Mogaka is eyeing the West Mugirango constituency MP seat on a Jubilee ticket. He said the electorates especially tea farmers should feel the presence of leaders they elect by how the leaders address issues affecting them. “When we elect leaders we have trust that the leaders can fight for us in all aspects, let us elect responsible leaders,” he said.
