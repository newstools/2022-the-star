Shinzo Abe was Japan's longest serving prime minister and stepped down in 2020 after a second term. But, he still had a huge influence over the current administration - for example when Russia invaded Ukraine, Abe came out and said Japan need to increase military spending. It came as a huge shock when we first heard the news that he had been shot at around 11:30 local time this morning in the city of Nara. Japan has a parliamentary election coming up this Sunday and that is why he was out on the streets giving a speech supporting one of the candidates in the city. Apparently that visit was only confirmed late last night so how the suspect managed to find out about this and prepare remains an open question. This kind of violence is extremely rare in Japan.
