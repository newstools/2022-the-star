Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua and her UDA counterpart Rigathi Gachagu stormed the deputy presidential debate venue flanked by their families. The two, in all appearances, fashioned themselves as family people perhaps to demonstrate their abilities in responsible parenthood. "The family is the basic unit of society and Nation. Strong families make a strong Nation. I am the head of my family" said Gachagua in his introductory remarks. Gachagua is married to pastor Dorcas, for 35 years, and together they have been blessed with two children; Kevin Gachagua and Keith Ikinu. "My firstborn son, Kevin, is a software engineer while Keith is a medical doctor," the  Mathira MP revealed. On the other hand, Martha was accompanied by his four grandchildren and two children; Wawira and Edward. Some of her brothers and sisters were also present. "I would like to thank my parents, who are still alive for instilling values of hard work, honesty, community and respect," said Martha. Karua was seen sharing lovely moments with her grandchildren who even walked to the stage to embrace her after they finished their debate.
