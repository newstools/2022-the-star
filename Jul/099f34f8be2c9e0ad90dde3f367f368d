Over 350 senior and junior golfers are set to contest the 14th leg of the Safaricom Golf Tour tournament at the Royal Golf Club this weekend. The weekend tournament marks the last stage of the tour before the Grand Finale scheduled for next week at Vipingo Ridge. The corporate tournament will take place on Saturday before paving way for the juniors on Sunday. Last weekend, Nelson Nyoike beat a star-studded field of 253 golfers to win the 13th leg of the tour at the Vet Lab Golf Club. The 12-year-old Belinda Wanjiru and 16-year-old Beiju Shah were crowned junior winners after beating a field of 165 players at the same venue. Just like in the previous editions, Saturday’s corporate tournament will run alongside the golf outreach program dubbed “Golf Mtaani”, where youngsters from the nearby community will get the chance to learn about the game. “As we approach the end of the first season, we are thrilled with the great milestones achieved in identifying and nurturing talent among our young people. We have engaged over 8,000 participants through our tournaments, outreaches and golf clinics including over 5,000 youngsters,” Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa said. Safaricom has invested Sh100 million in this inaugural edition of the tour with an aim of nurturing and growing golf talent.
