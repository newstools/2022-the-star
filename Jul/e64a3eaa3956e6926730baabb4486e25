If your phone response speed slows, clearing your Android app cache can help fix speed issues and free up storage space. Caches are temporary data files that are stored on your phone. Clearing your app cache every few months will help optimising  your phone and prevent it from getting too full, giving you more storage to work with. It may also help to resolve a variety of issues including signing in and clearing your browsing history. After you clear cached files, you regain some storage space and apps will respond faster, however, you may need to log into various applications again as your log-in information will also be deleted. Once you clear your cache, it comes back eventually over time as you use your device. Clearing app caches has to be done one app at a time. How to clear cache Step 1 Open Settings on your phone and select Storage or App settings. Step 2 In the resulting list, tap the Apps entry (other Apps on Android 11 and earlier). This will take you to a list of all the apps installed on your phone. Step 3 Choose which app's cache you want to clear. To see which apps are taking the most space, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and choose Sort by size. Step 4 On the app's info page, tap the Clear Cache option.
