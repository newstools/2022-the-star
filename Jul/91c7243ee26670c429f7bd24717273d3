Police are looking for the killers of a petrol attendant in Kochia, Rangwe constituency. The attackers masqueraded as buyers at the petrol station in Olare trading centre, Rangwe, on Saturday night. One of them, who was riding a motorbike, parked it as a normal fuel buyer would do. Upon seeing them, the petrol attendant went to serve them. In the process, one of the attackers hit him with a metal rod on the head and he collapsed. The assailants robbed him of all the money he had in his pockets. The attendant died on the spot. The attackers also assaulted a security guard and left him with serious injuries. The guard was taken to Homa Bay County Referral hospital. The attendant’s body was taken to the same hospital’s mortuary. On Tuesday, Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer Abed Kavoo said the thugs fled on the motorbike after killing and robbing the attendant. “We are going on with investigations to enable us to arrest them,” he said. A video footage of the attack on the petrol station attendant went viral on social media platforms on Tuesday evening. Edited by A.N
