Plans for the Kenya Kwanza mega rally in Deputy President William Ruto's South Rift stronghold are complete. Ruto is expected to lead a host of leaders from his camp to the rally at the historic Kapkatet grounds in Kericho on Sunday. The alliance has organised 11 big rallies across the country to drum up support for Ruto ahead of the August 9 polls. On Saturday, Bomet Governor Hillary Barchok among other leaders visited the stadium to access the preparations ahead of the much-awaited event. "I am happy with the preparations that have been made by leaders from regio towards ensuring the success of this important event," he said as addressed hundreds of residents. "All is now set for the grand rally Kapkatet... My passionate appeal to our people from all walks of life is to turn up in their numbers as we give our final blessings to our son," said Eric Mutai, Kericho UDA gubernatorial candidate. Bomet and Kericho account for more than 800,000 votes in the larger Rift Valley which has five million votes and is one of the regions where Ruto is banking on in his first presidential quest. In the two previous general elections, Ruto managed to persuade the residents to elect President Uhuru Kenyatta. President Kenyatta and Ruto visited the grounds in 2013 and 2017 for their last rallies.
