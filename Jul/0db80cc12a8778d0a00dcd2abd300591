Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi on Wednesday warned Kenyans against voting for Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga. He said voting for Raila is equivalent to giving President Uhuru Kenyatta a third term in office. "I told you 4 years ago that Uhuru Kenyatta doesn't want to retire," he wrote in a Facebook post. "From his statement yesterday (Tuesday), it is clearly evident that he doesn't want to go Ichaweri in the coming 26 days meaning that electing teamAzimio is as good as extending his term for the third time." On Tuesday, while campaigning for Raila, Uhuru said he is here to stay. He was commenting on the remarks of some of Kenya Kwanza allied members, who have been telling him to complete his term and go. "I'm here to stay. They keep telling me to finish and go, where will I go? I am here to stay. I won’t go to Somalia,” he said. The William Ruto-led camp has been hitting out at Uhuru for campaigning for Raila and being the Azimio chairperson. The president, however, made it clear that he is not seeking an elective seat in the August 9 polls and urged those attacking him to stop. "I am not looking for votes. I will do my job until the last minute." He added that there is a lot of work to be done in the remaining days saying: "I will do the work until I hand over to the next president and I pray that the person who I will pass the baton to is Raila Odinga".
