Snapchat has announced that it is launching a web version, that will allow snapping, chatting and video calling. However, the feature will only be compatible with Google’s Chrome browser but not Apple’s Safari and will be available exclusively for premium users. While some users may be expressing demand to use Snapchat on desktop, the reason it’s rolling out now most likely comes down to revenue. The firm says that the desktop version will not contain any ads to begin with but they introduce them in the future. To use Snapchat for the web, you must first subscribe to Snapchat+(PLUS) which is available in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The firm hopes to roll out the subscription based premium version globally soon. Snapchat for Web includes top messaging features like Chat Reactions and Chat Reply, along with Lenses which will roll out soon.
