Waithera spoke on Monday while releasing the financial results in Nanyuki. She said the growth of own-source revenue collection had transformed into development projects in the county. This included upgrading and rebranding the Laikipia Health Service, and the Smart Town Initiatives in Nanyuki, Nyahururu, Rumuruti and other towns within the county.
