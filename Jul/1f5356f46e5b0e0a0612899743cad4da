President Uhuru Kenyatta has fired back at his deputy William Ruto and his allies following the recent attacks that they directed at him. Uhuru while launching the Nairobi expressway told Ruto to focus on selling his agenda, rather than spreading what he termed as "lies". "Uza sera zako wachana na mimi. Mimi nafanya kazi yangu nimalize. Nyinyi endeni muuze sera mkipewa ni sawa mukininyima twende nyumbani pamoja," Uhuru said. The President noted that he decided to fire back at them because they have been lying to the masses. He said he has been president for the last five years and he has never harmed anyone despite the numerous attacks they have fired at him. Uhuru said he had the power to do anything for the period but he didn't because he has no ill intention against anyone. "Nimekujibu kwa sababu umeambia watu mambo ya uongo. Si mumenitusi karibu karibu miaka tatu. Kuna mtu amewagusa? Hiyo miaka mitatu si nimekua kwa kiti?" "Si nilikua na uwezo? Sasa wakati naelekea kupeana serikali na sina uwezo ndio niko na time ya kukutafuta?" Uhuru's response comes after Ruto attacked him on Friday accusing him of issuing threats. Ruto said the president had held a private meeting during which he threatened him and his allies. “I want to ask Mr President, please, you should not be the source of threats in Kenya. Stop threatening Kenyans, your work is making sure all Kenyans are united,” he said while speaking in Kapsabet, Nandi County. “Stop saying we will know you are the president, we are the ones who elected you to the presidency. Stop threatening us, We cannot be threatened.” He added: “With a lot of respect be a decent human being, we are the ones who helped you so stop pretending now, you have started threatening me but as long as you don't harm my children, let us respect each other.”
