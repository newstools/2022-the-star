Team Kenya at the 2022 World Athletics Championships in Oregon has been dealt a major blow after Lawrence Cherono was provisionally  suspended for anti-doping rule violation. Cherono, 33, had been listed to represent the country in the marathon race scheduled for Sunday. However, an analysis of his sample conducted by the the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) revealed the presence of Trimetazidine (TMZ), a medication used to treat heart-related conditions like angina. The drug helps to metabolize fatty acids, which helps your body use oxygen. It also allows for more blood flow to your heart and limits quick changes in your blood pressure. This can help lessen chest pain from blocked blood vessels. Cherono rose to the limelight after clinching the Valencia Marathon’s men’s elite race on December 5, 2021. He won the race in two hours, five minutes and 12 seconds. He had wrapped up in second position in the preceding year. On April 15, 2019, Cherono out-sprinted two-time Boston winner and World Championship Silver medalist Lelisa Desisa on the final block of Boylston Street to win the Boston Marathon. Then on October 13, 2019, Cherono won the 2019 Chicago Marathon with a time of 2:05:45. He donned the Kenyan colours for the first time at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games where he finished fourth in the men’s marathon race in Sapporo. Cherono, who trains under the Rosa Associati Management, is currently ranked as the eighth fastest marathoner of all time in the world. He was one of the athletes honoured by President Kenyatta during the 2021 Mashujaa Day celebrations where he was conferred the Head of State Commendation through the Baringo County Commissioner Henry Wafula.
