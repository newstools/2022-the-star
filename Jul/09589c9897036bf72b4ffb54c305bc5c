Ten newly graduated Al Shabaab terrorists were on Friday killed in an operation conducted in Boni Forest by Kenya Defence Forces. KDF says several others escaped with multiple injuries. The operation was carried out between Sarira and Kolbio areas, within the expansive Boni Forest. "One Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) launcher, several assault weapons, assorted ammunitions as well as personal effects were recovered during the operations," KDF said. The militants were part of the Jeysh Ayman team led by Maalim Ayman, KDF said. They added that Ayman had planned to carry out attacks within the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor. KDF has assured that, alongside other security agencies and support from the locals, it will continue with the operations along the Kenya -Somali border. They said they will, "pacify the area to get rid of Al-Shabaab terrorists." In March, two suspected Al-Shabaab militants were killed in the Boni Forest area. The Defence forces recovered guns. The area has been under operation for years as Kenya seeks to remove the terrorists and their remnants from the region.
