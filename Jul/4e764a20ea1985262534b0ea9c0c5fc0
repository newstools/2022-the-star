The Turkana government has formed ward committees to spearhead locally-led climate change action. The unveiling of the ward committees come after the successful enactment of the County Climate Change Act 2021, which was signed into law by Governor Josphat Nanok in October last year. Deputy governor Peter Lotethiro said the county is committed to implementing action to combat the effects of climate change and strengthen resilience of communities against shocks. “Turkana county is committed towards implementation of SDG 13, Paris Agreement, COP 26 resolution and National Climate Change Act 2016,” he said. “We have enacted the Turkana County Climate Act 2021 which provides for a legal and institutional framework for climate change interventions, and provides for mechanisms to achieve low carbon development pathways as well as climate financing.” Lotethiro spoke after issuing appointment letters to members of ward committees on Wednesday. He said the ward committees are chaired by a ward administrator. The teams constitute eight members and are required by law to identify climate change projects. “The projects will be funded through the Climate Change Fund established through Climate Change Regulations set at not less than two per cent of the county’s annual development budget as well as funding from the national government and partners,” Lotethiro said. He said the county government has qualified for World Bank Financing Locally Led Climate Action (FLoCCA) programme. Lotethiro said the national government had committed Sh125 million to FLoCCA. He praised the programme as a true reflection of the empowerment initiative and said the county government appreciates the support of partner organisations.
