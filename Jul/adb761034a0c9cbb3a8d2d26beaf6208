Kajiado UDA gubernatorial candidate Katoo Metito early Friday engaged residents of Nkaimurunya and Oloolua wards and told them they will form the next government together. Metito who spoke everywhere he stopped and in the Karumaindo area of Nkaimurunya ward said his government will be inclusive. “You are part of my next government because all the people living in this county are part and parcel of my leadership, long gone are the days when other communities were left out of the county government,” said Metito. In Oloolua Ward within the Kajiado North sub-county, Metito asked for votes and appealed to the residents to forge peace in the coming general election. “We are going together into this election as brothers and sisters, and after we are through we will need each other because life has to continue,” said Metito. Metito urged the voters to reject leaders threatening their security, saying the county is home to all Kenyans. “We in UDA have been campaigning throughout the region and airing what we shall do our people is elected and not threatening non-Maasai people for failing to support us,” said Metito. He claimed that the current economic recession facing the country has been caused by bad governance from the top. “The prices of virtually everything has gone up. Our people in the county whose livelihood depends on livestock are threatened by drought. They need food aid from the county and national governments. Our people are starving,” said Metito. He said that hospitals have no other drugs other than painkillers, adding that patients are referred to pharmacies whose owners have links with those in leadership at the county government. He also said the people in all county urban areas have no water and the county is not concerned about the sad situation. “Once I am elected, I will empower the counties by setting aside money for each MCA in 25 wards for development. MCAs have direct involvement with the people they lead in the wards, and therefore I will expect them to act responsibly,” Metito said. Metito is facing other two top contenders - Joseph Lenku (ODM) and David Nkedianye (Jubilee), and Ambrose Kago (Independent) in the August 9 general election. The vote breakdown shows that Kajiado North is leading with 134,000 registered voters followed by Kajiado East with 116,000 votes - these are the two county vote baskets in the region. Kajiado county has 463,000 registered voters in the 2022 general election.
