The Architectural Association of Kenya has said there is a need to have efficient and robust e-government systems for effective service delivery. AAK president Wilson Mugambi urged national and county governments to improve existing systems and fully automate government services and systems to achieve sustainable development. Speaking in Mombasa, he said some of the challenges being faced by professionals and developers include inefficiencies, frequent downtimes and delays which force them to visit county offices to follow up on approvals. “These challenges have become precursors for issuance of false permits by quacks and fraudulent professionals, thereby resulting in the construction of unsafe and illegal structures,” Mugambi said. He said having a one-stop-shop for all related agencies will facilitate a faster flow of development applications and optimise customer service. In a recorded speech, Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana highlighted statistics in a UN report that predicts that Africa’s population of more than 1.3 billion would more than double by 2050 and 80 per cent of those would be in cities, particularly in the slums. “Kenya has been pinpointed as one of Africa’s fastest growing cities whose population has doubled in the last 25 years. It has been estimated that in the next 40 years, Kenya’s population will grow by one million every year, translating to 3,000 people every day and 22 people every hour. In fact, by 2058, we will have about 100 million people in our country,” Kibwana said. The governor said the effects of urbanisation were being felt, with most pressure to provide basic services and infrastructure to areas that a few years ago were considered the hinterland. “The sustainability of our urban areas therefore can only be realised through a shared dream by all stakeholders, but professionals must play a key role,” Kibwana said.
