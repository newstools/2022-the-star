The much awaited Presidential debate will be held on Tuesday, July 26, 2022 at the Catholic University of East Africa, Nairobi. The event will be broadcast live across all TV and radio stations from 4pm to 10pm. The Presidential Debate Secretariat had scheduled the debate to be held in two tiers each featuring two presidential candidates. However, two presidential aspirants expressed reservations and indicated that they won't appear. Roots Party candidate George Wajackoyah cited unfair treatment saying all four candidates should feature in the same debate. Azimio la Umoja One Kenya flag-bearer Raila Odinga on the other hand said he would alternatively hold a televised public engagement alongside his running mate Martha Karua at Jericho Social Hall. This left UDA presidential candidate and Kenya Kwanza leader William Ruto and Agano Party candidate David Waihiga Mwaure as the only candidates to feature in the debate. Five renowned journalists were selected to host the presidential debate. These are Smriti Vidyarthi (NTV), Ken Mijungu (KTN), Yvonne Okwara (Citizen TV), Eric Latiff (Spice FM) and Joe Ageyo (NTV). Ageyo will moderate the panel discussions for both debates. A scheduled released earlier by the debate secretariat said Smriti and Mijungu would moderate tier one debate featuring candidates whose popularity in three recent opinion polls stood below 5 per cent. These are Wajackoyah and Waihiga. The second debate which would feature the two leading contenders -Raila and Ruto - would be moderated by Yvonne and Latiff. Diplomats from 24 countries are expected to attend the debate.
