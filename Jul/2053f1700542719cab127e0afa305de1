Kenya, with the support of the Federal Government of Germany, Lake Victoria Basin Commission and the East African Community Secretariat, has launched an integrated water project. The Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) project is financed at a tune of €3.3 million (approximately Sh396 million) and is an additional contribution to LVBC’s sustainable development agenda. Project beneficiaries include EAC Secretariat, LVBC EAC partner states, institutions within EAC partner states responsible for water resource management, representatives of civil society and the private sector. LVBC executive secretary Bwire Masinde said the expected results of the project included harmonised policies, strategies and guidelines such as lake level management and water quality improvement. The project will also contribute towards enhancing the resource mobilisation role of LVBC. It will also contribute to sustainability of existing development initiatives such as high priority investments, which are yet to be implemented in the five EAC partner states. HPIs are funded by Federal Government of Germany through KfW and the European Union.
