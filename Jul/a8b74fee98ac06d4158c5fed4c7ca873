Meru Senator Mithika Linturi has told off Interior CS Peter Kibicho over a meeting he held with administrators. He said Kibicho is going against the constitution by using national government administration officers to campaign for Azimio. "He should forget it Meru will not be dictated on who they will vote for if he has failed to get Azimio support in Kirinyaga," Linturi said. He spoke at Nkubu, South Imenti constituency on Thursday where he accompanied South Imenti MP Kathuri Murungi to distribute CDF bursary cheques for needy students. Linturi said administrators should not take illegal orders. He said Kibicho is arrogant and pride comes before a fall. "We will deal with such characters on August 9 when Kenyans will overwhelmingly vote for Ruto as President,"  Linturi said. He said PS Kibicho should instead concentrate on insecurity in the country rather than engaging in politics. Linturi sentiments were echoed by MP Kathuri Murungi who said the relief food given out to cushion Kenyans from hunger was being used to campaign for Azimio. "We passed a budget of Sh.5 billion in parliament but am yet to see any residents getting relief food in the constituency," Murungi said. He said the food should be taken to vulnerable schools instead of being used to campaign.
