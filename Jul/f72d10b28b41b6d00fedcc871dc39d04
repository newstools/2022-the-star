Two-time World Under-20 3,000m steeplechase champion Celliphine Chespol is uncertain of her participation at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham due to injuries. Chespol finished a distant 13th during the women's 3,000m steeplechase final at the World Championships in Oregon on Thursday, where she revealed she was suffering from aching knees, right from the pre-race warm-up. The 2018 Commonwealth silver medallist revealed she had even contemplated withdrawing from the final were it not for one of the team coaches. "I am not sure if I will compete at the Commonwealth Games," said Chespol, the 2015 World U18 Championships. "I had excruciating pain during the last warm-up session in Oregon and had even thought of not starting the race. I thank God I was able to finish the race, all courtesy of Ken (Mary Moraa's coach), who came to my aid with a massage session now that we do not have physiotherapists in the Team Kenya camp." However, the 2017 Prefontaine Classic 3,000m steeplechase winner, went on to assure her fans that better days lie ahead. "I am still hopeful that better days lie ahead and my day to shine again will come soon," she said In Oregon, Chespol clocked 9:27.34 as Kenyan-born Norah Jeruto — who runs for Kazakhstan— clinched the title in 8:53.02, the third fastest of all time. This was five seconds better than world record holder Beatrice Chepkoech’s 2019 winning mark in Doha. Ethiopia's Werkuha Getachew took silver in 8:54.61 while compatriot Mekides Abebe struck bronze in 8:56.08.
