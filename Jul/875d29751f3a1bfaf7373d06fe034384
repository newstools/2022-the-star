Kenya posted mixed results as the 3x3 U23 Nations League Africa South tournament tipped off at the Nyayo Stadium handball courts on Monday. Kenya beat Benin 17-15 in overtime after a 15-15 stalemate. The two teams were separated by a fine shot nailed by Gabriel Onyango. The host had started off superbly before the visitors started to cause problems. Earlier, Kenya struggled for grip before going down 18-15 to eventual Stage One winners Uganda. The winners had rolled away to a 4-0 advantage. “We had already lost our first game of the day and so there was nothing to lose here. It was all or nothing, so I received the pass and took a shot that went in,” said Onyango, adding that they struggled with team chemistry earlier in the game. In the women’s category, towering Medina Okot’s last-minute effort ensured that Kenya broke off a 12-12 tie to post a satisfying 15-12 victory over Rwanda. But they went on to lose 18-17 to Uganda, who came from behind to carry the day. “We took time to open up and that is why we struggled early. But we put up a fight since we did not want to lose,” Said Okot after the win against the Rwandese. In other men’s games, Botswana lost 13-15 to Benin, who also blanked Botswana 15-13 as a last-minute effort by Uganda saw them pip Rwanda 21-20. In the women’s category, Uganda beat Botswana 14-9 while Benin won 16-11 over Botswana. Rwanda nipped Benin 20-19. Five men's and five women’s teams are taking part in the competition that is scheduled to conclude this weekend.
