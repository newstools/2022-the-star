So, what about the viral videos?" she said. "Those are just normal videos. Just because we were feeding each doesn't mean anything. He and I are not lovers. We have never been in love. "It is just friendship. We were just having a good time and to fool social media people. When we were doing that, he was with his girlfriend." Esma went on to say the comedian's girlfriend is her friend. During the interview, Esma said she is in a serious relationship and looking forward to getting married soon. She described her man as the smartest man ever. "He is hardworking and he is always smart and his looks are to die for. He is also a friend," she said, adding that she is ready to spend her entire life together with him. "My next marriage will not last three months like the previous one. I can't date someone who can't lift me up."
