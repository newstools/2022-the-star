ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has stated he will run government affairs in Kenya Kwanza if they clinch power after August polls. Mudavadi was speaking in Sabatia, Vihiga county during a campaign trail trying to woo them to vote for Kenya Kwanza flag-bearer William Ruto as he would become the third most powerful person. Mudavadi also called on the electorates to vote for ANC candidate for the governor position. "If you won't have a governor who is in Kenya Kwanza, how many times will that governor have to call in order to reach the president?" Mudavadi asked. "My responsibilities in the government will be to run state affairs. I'm asking, you want me to control the affairs and you have not elected my people?" On Monday, Mudavadi urged Western residents to vote for Ruto because that is where they have been promised a share of the government. Mudavadi said on Sunday he and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang'ula negotiated a pre-election pact with Ruto to get a 30 per cent share of Kenya Kwanza government if the alliance wins in August. He said Luhyas in Azimio-One Kenya have no stake in the coalition. “When they come here, ask them to show you the agreement they have signed to safeguard your interest as a community other than being promised positions. Ours is in the public domain,” Mudavadi said. “Wetang'ula, Ruto and I are partners in the coming government. For us to get change, I'm calling on all of you to vote for Ruto, whom we have teamed up with in the coming election."
