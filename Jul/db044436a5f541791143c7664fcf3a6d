Azimio running mate Martha Karua has for the first time talked about the presidential running mate debate that took place on July 19. Speaking to KBC, Karua said Kenya Kwanza running mate Rigathi Gachagua was on a mission to provoke her which did not yield fruits as she kept her cool. Karua said Gachagua wanted to play smart by provoking her, but was disappointed because she remained calm. Karua was responding to a question of why she was calm during the debate which many are not used to, as she is known to be aggressive. "They were waiting for me to get angry and start arguing with Gachagua, during the debate. They thought they are too smart that they would trigger me, but I held my cool and they they are the ones who were disappointed," she said. Karua said Gachagua did not have an agenda that is why he was out of the topic. "When you don't have an agenda and you are afraid of your history, you don't want peaceful talks but throwing words. What took me there was to explain our Azimio agenda and not conflict, it was not my first time to attend a debate, or being on TV." "There are debate procedures, I abided with them," she added. Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga said he was proud of Karua's performance in the presidential debate. Raila praised the former Justice minister for her mastery of matters raised in the debate and poise. He added that the Azimio family was happy with her performance. "Your poise, mastery of subject matters, and staying calm even when provoked were impressive. I congratulate my able deputy and team member Martha Karua. The Azimio family stands proud of your performance during last night's debate. Keep selling," Raila said in a tweet.
