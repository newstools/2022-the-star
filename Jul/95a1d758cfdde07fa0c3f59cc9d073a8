The Director General of Criminal Investigations  (DCI) George Kinoti,  on Tuesday received 32 rehabilitated police vehicles. The Directorate said the rehabilitation costed a total of Sh9.4 million. Kinoti acknowledged that a total of Sh150 million that would have been used to buy 32 new vehicles had been saved. "We have repaired each of them at an average cost of Sh300,000 making a huge saving of Sh4.7 million for each new vehicle that the government would have bought," he added. The vehicles had previously been declared unserviceable and un-roadworthy. However, following mobility challenges experienced by the Directorate, in August 2021, Kinoti ordered that all vehicles that had been grounded and were due for disposal via public auction, be repaired immediately. This prompted the repairing of 32 vehicles that were to be disposed as junks in different police stations across the country. "Had these vehicles been disposed via public auction, none would have fetched the government more than Sh50,000," Kinoti said. While flagging off the vehicles to different stations across the country, he urged officers to take good care of them. He further requested the NPS members to use the cars in efficient and effective service delivery to Kenyans.
