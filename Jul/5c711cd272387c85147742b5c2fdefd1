Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja now says the DCI is planning to raid his campaign secretariat office. The office is domiciled at ANC party headquarters, Nairobi. Speaking to the Star on Thursday, the Senator, who is eyeing the Nairobi governor seat on a UDA ticket said he has gathered reports that the agency is after him over IEBC servers. Sakaja has however dismissed the allegations saying he hosts no server. "I have received credible information that DCI is planning to raid my office and I do not know why but I gather that he believes we are hosting servers to be used for hacking IEBC and I find those claims ridiculous," he said. "Tuko kazi kama kawaida but If thy are coming they will find us," said one of Sakaja's personal assistant. More to follow.......
