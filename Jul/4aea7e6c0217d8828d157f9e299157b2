Kibra MP Imran Okoth on Tuesday turned down Raila Odinga's request to step down from the race to defend his seat. On Sunday, Raila asked Okoth to drop his bid in favour of Peter Mwalimu Orero, an ODM candidate, with the promise of an appointment in the Azimio government. Okoth is defending his seat as an independent candidate. "For the longest time, we were a community associated with social injustices and we waited for others to help us. But we can now see what happens when we realize that we can make powerful steps through the decisions we make. Sisi hatutachoka kutumikia watu wa Kibra! I request you to also keep working with us," Okoth said in a Facebook post. "We can do this! On the 9th of August 2022, please vote for me - Bernard Otieno Okoth, so that we make sure we keep the work going." Imran became the Kibra MP in November 2019 after he won the by-election occasioned by the death of his brother, then MP Ken Okoth. Raila while addressing Kibra residents on Sunday, expressed his confidence in winning the race and promised to 'hold' Imran's hand. "I will be with Imran in government, let Mwalimu continue here in Kibra," Raila said. Okoth and Orero both contested in the ODM primaries in which the incumbent lost. Raila has been pushing for six-piece voting to boost his numbers in the August 9 polls.
