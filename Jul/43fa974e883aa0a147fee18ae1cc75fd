Boy band Jadi have released the video to their much-anticipated single, 'Maji'. The heart-warming visuals tell the story of a girl yearning for the real love of a gentleman. “Sometimes you can be in a toxic or abusive relationship and not realise how beautiful and valuable you are," said Brandon, one half of the duo. Vince added, "This is a song that speaks about a beautiful lady caught up with the wrong man but finds herself falling for two men in her life in a love connection that goes beyond the physical.” Since being signed under Kaka Empire, the duo have been consistently releasing music. The duo prides itself in writing their own music, while reflecting the lives of the typical Kenyan youth and the battles they fight daily.
