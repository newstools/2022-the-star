A website purporting to belong to Kenya Airways and running cash promotions is fake. The website contains the national carrier's logo and claims that participants in the promotion stand to win Sh9,000 in government subsidies. The airline has dismissed the promotion as a fraudulent scheme. “All our marketing and commercial initiatives are posted on our official social media platforms and websites,” Kenya Airways said in a tweet. The fraudulent website is instructing users to answer a multiple-choice questionnaire to redeem the cash subsidy. The website said the subsidy was issued by government to mark KQ's 45th Anniversary, also false claim. KQ marked its 45th birthday on January 21, commemorating its inception in January 22nd 1977. The airline offered customers up to 45 per cent discounts on flight fares for leisure, family and business travel in celebration of the anniversary. The offer applied to travel bookings done between January 21 to 23 for travel scheduled until November 30, 2022. Kenya Airways called on the public to verify any information regarding it on its official social media platforms or website or call +254 741 131 526 for any clarification
