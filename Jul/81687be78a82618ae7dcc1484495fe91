Kenya Simbas were taught a rugby lesson after losing 36-0 to Namibia in the Rugby World Cup qualifiers final in Marseille, France on Sunday. Paul Odera's charges were their own worst enemies with handling errors and poor decision-making. However, the Simbas will have another chance to seek qualification to the World Cup at the four-team repêchage in November. The Southern African giants took an early lead when flanker Wian Conradie scored an unconverted try for a 5-0 cushion. The Simbas were on the back foot, failing to beat the gain line despite having possession. The Simbas were penalised for an infringement at the breakdown and Clive Loubser kicked the penalty for an 8-0 lead Conradie was on the mark again four minutes before halftime when he dived over the line to score with Loubser adding the conversion for a 15-0 lead at the interval. On resumption, the Namibians punished Kenya with smart territorial kicks and were handed two penalties which Loubser converted for a 24-0 lead Conradie then completed his hattrick five minutes from time with PW Steenkamp slotting home the conversion for a 31-0 lead. Jean Deysel then completed the scoring for Namibia with a well-taken try.
