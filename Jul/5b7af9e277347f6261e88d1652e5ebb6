TikTok has confirmed that has begun testing a new function that will let users restrict their livestream to viewers who are 18 years and above. According to TechCrunch, the company is already testing the setting with selected users. Users will navigate to their settings and click "mature theme" button to restrict their Live to adults only. Once the user turns on the setting, he or she will be notified that videos tagged under 18+ will still be removed if they violate community guidelines. Meaning posts involving nudity, sexual activity or violence will continued to be removed. This move, according to the company, is a way to prevent minors from encountering adult content. “We have heard directly from our creators that they sometimes have a desire to only reach a specific older audience. So, as an example, maybe they are creating a comedy that has adult humor, or offering kind of boring workplace tips that are relevant only to adults. Or maybe they are talking about very difficult life experiences,” Tracy Elizabeth, TikTok’s U.S. head of Issue Policy said. “Given those varieties of topics, we are testing ways to help better empower creators to reach the intended audience for their specific content.”
