After a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools’ sporting calendar is set to resume amid excitement in the education circles. A member of the Athletics Kenya youth sub-committee, Eliud Wambua, expressed his gratitude to Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha for giving them a green light to bring back sporting activities in the schools' circles. Wambua said they are hoping to organise the national primary and secondary schools games at Kigari Teachers Training College once the schools open for the second term. He said the national secondary Schools’ event will be used as a yardstick to pick teams for the East Africa Secondary School games in Arusha, Tanzania in September. “The Ministry of Education went into paralysis on sports activities because of the pandemic. It has been two years since we had any sporting activity and after serious consultations, we realized we had lost too much talent,” he said. Wambua noted that the lack of sports in schools for the past two years had affected the ministry and the youth and twogroups had been lost. He also pointed out that the discipline in the youth had dwindled ostensibly due to a lack of activities to keep them busy. “The youth couldn’t get a chance to participate in the championships and this has led to misconduct on several occasions. Most of them had lost hope and this is a great opportunity to redeem our children,” he said. He also said Athletics Kenya had benefitted immensely from athletes from school for the World Under-20 and youth Championships and the return of sports will ensure the flow. Preparations for the ball games are ongoing and everything will be confirmed once schools open for their second term.
