Hit Squad coach Benjamin Musa believes the boxing quartet heading to the Commonwealth Games, Birmingham later this month can charge to the podium if they avoid top seeds in their preliminary bouts. Speaking during a training session at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Thursday, Musa insisted his charges have the required experience to clinch gold medals, which eluded the nation in the last two editions of the Club Games. Kenya managed bronze medals at both the 2014 and 2018 Games but Musa believes they can go one step better this time. “Our fingers are crossed that the draw will be kind to us. If our boxers escape top seeds at the start of competition in their various weight categories, then we will have a realistic chance of going deep in the competition,” said Musa. Christine Ongare (featherweight), Elizabeth Andiego (middleweight), Shafi Bakari (bantamweight) and captain Nick Okoth (featherweight) will carry the country’s flag in the United Kingdom. In a bid to get it right this time around, Musa added that they are working on defence, precision and some facets of attack. “Boxers must know when to move in and out of range without compromising their position. Our work is cut out since boxers fight for both national glory and individual pride,” said Musa. Team manager Albert Matitu added that Kenya have no excuses to produce their best performance having enjoyed the best of preparations for the quadrennial show. “Boxers have been to men’s World Boxing Championships in Serbia (August 2021) and the Women Boxing Championships in May in Turkey. The Africa Zone 3 qualifiers in Congo further highlight the exposure the team has enjoyed,” said Matitu. “These competitions have put our boxers in better shape for the task ahead. Boxing is all about chances and we have to take ours.” Meanwhile, Musa is worried whether the less than a week time Team Kenya will spend in Birmingham before the competition will be enough for the athletes to acclimatise.
