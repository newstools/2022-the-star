The government has cautioned schools against conducting holiday tuition contrary to the Ministry of Education directive. Principal Secretary for Early Learning and Basic Education Julius Jwan has told school heads to let children be with their parents. The PS spoke on Monday during the ongoing Kenya Private Schools Association (KPSA) annual conference at Pride Inn in Mombasa. The Ministry of Education banned holiday tuition in August 2008 for both private and government schools, terming the extra learning as “prison tuition”. Learners went for a ten-day break on July 1 at the end of the first term and will resume studies for term two on Monday, July 11. Meanwhile, the ministry has directed Quality Assurance and Standards officials to reinspect all private schools with a view to determining their preparedness for Junior Secondary School (JSS). The directive was issued by Education CS George Magoha during his address at the KPSA conference. The pioneer class of Grade 6 learners will transition to Junior Secondary School in January 2023. Some 1.24 million candidates will sit the inaugural Kenya Primary School Education Assessment (KPSEA) under the CBC from November 28. A timetable released by the Kenya National Examination Council (KNEC) indicates candidates will be assessed in five papers for three days until November 30, 2022. The PS for Implementation of Curriculum Reforms Fatuma Chege said the government has prepared guidelines for the placement of Grade 6 pupils in Junior Secondary Schools (JSS). Magoha said the guidelines will be released soon.
