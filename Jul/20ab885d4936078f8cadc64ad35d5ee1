Residents of Mosobecho in Kapsabet are mourning the death of a man suspected to have been murdered on Friday night. The body of Elvis Kipkemei, 27, a Meru University graduate was found lying at his house mid-day on Saturday by his family. Blood was oozing from his mouth, the door into his house was not locked and one of his phones was missing. Nandi central OCPD Doris Chemos said investigations into the murder had started. Area chief Ezekiel Chepsiror said there were clear indications that the deceased was killed elsewhere and his body dragged into his house. “There were blood drops from the road to his house,” Chepsiror said. The smartphone left behind had been formatted and fully charged at the time the body was discovered. Residents believe the nursing graduate was murdered by people known to him, the reason why they were able to locate his rural home. The chief said they had given police leads into the murder saying there was a vehicle suspected to have been used to “deliver” the body into his house and whose registration number was captured by a resident. The deceased formatted phone is likely to contain the last conversations and details of whoever was with him. A fiancée of the deceased (name withheld) said she last had a conversation with him on Friday afternoon on WhatsApp. “He didn’t tell me where he was and what he was doing, he however had a premonition of his death as he had expressed fears of being killed before the end of the year,” she said. “He however did not reveal to me who was after his life, he only expressed the sympathy of how I could cry when I view his lifeless body.” His parents were in shock over the death of their son. His body is at the Kapsabet County Referral Mortuary. An autopsy would be conducted as soon as the family gets a private pathologist. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
