Bomet county commissioner Beverly Opwora has launched an initiative to advance gender equality, end gender-based violence and FGM in the region. The launch of Generation Equality Forum drew stakeholders from different parts of the county and the community. Generation Equality is an international platform that seeks to accelerate the implementation of gender equality commitments as outlined in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995 to achieve transformative change. Kenya is co-leading the gender-based violence action coalition alongside other countries. Opwora urged gender and the children’s departments to support each other in the war against retrogressive practices. She said the government is continually coming up with programmes to end GBV. “To fight FGM and GBV, we only need to use the available resources because resources can never be enough. As a government, we're committed to coming up with programmes to bring to an end the two vices,” Opwora said. She said defilement cases have significantly reduced countrywide, and applauded the Judiciary and the public for their cooperation and hard work. The administrator said everyone has an equal opportunity to make an impact. “We have been bestowed with an opportunity to make an impact. I'm glad that we are now focusing on these issues that are dragging us behind,” she said Social Services and Gender Affairs executive Alice Kirui said education forums on FGM can help end the practice. “Things have changed and the current challenge is that married women are becoming victims which is very wrong. Lack of knowledge, information and empowerment are the major causes, but we are working on this to encourage them to speak up,” she said.
