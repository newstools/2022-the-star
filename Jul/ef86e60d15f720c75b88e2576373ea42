Pombe hitmaker Iyanii has teamed up with Tanzanian Singer Harmonize for the remix of his song 'Furaha'. The song was produced by Alexis On The Beat, with the original video uploaded on YouTube in December last year. This is the second remix of the song. In April, Iyanii worked on another remix with Arrow Bwoy, Nadia Mukami, Kristoff, Dogo Janja and Exray. Iyanii is always capitalising on any season with catchy songs that perfectly capture any mood, especially the party mood. In February, he released a Valentine's Day song while in December, he released a Christmas jam. "This is a song that will help people forget about stress, and I’m glad the song has been a success. I wanted to give people a reason to give December more value," he said. Iyanii also has a gospel collabo with Size 8, with which he said he wanted to minister to people.
