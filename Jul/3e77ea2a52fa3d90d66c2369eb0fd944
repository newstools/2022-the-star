Lawyer Nelson Havi has questioned why the detectives have delayed probing the three Venezuelans arrested with election materials at JKIA. Speaking in an interview on Spice FM on Monday, Havi said the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives are taking so long to investigate the three. "We do not want to waste more time, there are a few days to the election, and the problem is evolving around the election materials," he said. Havi added the election date is fast approaching and the detectives are not quick enough to handle the matter yet it involves the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). "How long do they need to investigate the matter? They ought to have given us a report by now," Havi who is also a Westlands Member of Parliament aspirant said. He said the issue with the electoral body should not take long since they need to focus on delivering credible results in the August general elections. "With only fourteen days left, IEBC should be focusing on making sure they deliver to the public, but this can not happen if the detectives do not play their role," he said. The three Venezuelans were arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on Thursday. DCI boss George Kinoti accused them of sneaking election material into the country since they are not officials of the IT firm contracted by the electoral body. Kinoti questioned why no IEBC officials were present at the airport to receive the foreigners. They were identified as Jose Comargo Gregorio, Joel Gustavo Rodriguez Garcia and Salvador Javier Sosa Suarez. They were on Thursday grilled before being released. They are expected to appear before the DCI  on Tuesday for the second time.
