Police have warned motorists using the Nairobi-Nakuru highway to be careful due to increased accidents along the highway during the cold season because of misty and foggy conditions. The disaster management unit head at police headquarters Duncan Ochieng says the conditions distract the drivers' vision. He urged the drivers to help reduce the carnage by driving at moderate speeds. Lari deputy police commander Charles Opondo said they record accidents where motorists and passengers are injured while others die. He said areas heavily affected by misty conditions include Limuru, Ngarariga, Nyambare, Kimende, Kijabe, Kinale up to Soko Mjinga. “We have recorded different types of accidents but most of them are caused by overspeeding,” he said. They spoke at Nyambare shopping centre where St John Ambulance held drills to test the preparedness of residents in case of an accident and how to handle emergencies. St John Ambulance chief executive Harun Gikera said they organised the drills to establish how the community handle accidents before the police arrive and take the victims to the hospital. Gikera said they trained the residents on first aid tips on how to handle victims of accidents and mourners at a funeral. He said road accidents contribute to the highest fatalities and that is why they started highway rescue centres in Mombasa, Busia, Ngarariga, Lari, Machakos, Maai Mahiu among other noted blackspots.
