Dala Sevens takes centre stage this weekend in Kisumu following a two-week break. The National Sevens Circuit is wide open after three teams won the opening three tournaments of the circuit and the event in the lakeside city promises fireworks. Ten points separate the top four teams on the circuit with KCB leading on 58 followed by Strathmore and Menengai Oilers who are joint second on 53. Mwamba are fourth on 48 with the series at halfway stage. Mwamba, who won the Driftwood Sevens a fortnight ago in Mombasa, will fancy their chances in Kisumu as they headline Pool 'A' which includes hosts Kisumu, a resurgent Nondies and a plucky Nakuru outfit. Tactician Peter Kepha said his charges will be under the microscope and will have to take it one game at a time. "It's a tricky pool and the nature of sevens is unpredictable. Everyone will want to beat us and we must guard against complacency," said Kepha. The side known as Kulabu open their campaign against Kisumu followed thereafter by matches against Nakuru and Nondies to conclude the preliminaries. Menengai Oilers will be seeking to go one place better after losing to Mwamba in the final in Mombasa. Gibson Weru's charges take on Kabras, Daystar University and Masinde  Muliro University in Pool B. The Nakuru-based side will have Kenya Simbas winger Beldad Ogeta bolster their chances of winning the event. Weru said they will be going for nothing short of victory. "We have played on two semis and a final and logically, the next step is to win a title. We have worked on several aspects of our game and I am confident that we can win," added Weru. KCB have recalled veteran forward Andrew Amonde for the event and face Strathmore, Impala and Blak Blad in tricky Pool C. Homeboyz are the favourites in Pool 'D' and will face Quins Zetech Oaks and Catholic Monks.
