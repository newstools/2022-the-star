A report from Nikkei has revealed that Japanese camera maker Nikon may soon halt production of single-lens reflex cameras to focus more on mirrorless cameras. This comes amid intensifying competition from smartphone and mirrorless cameras which have become increasingly popular among influencers and professional photographers. “From now on, Nikon intends to focus on digital mirrorless cameras, but production and distribution of existing SLR models will continue,” Nikkei said. In June, Nikon announced that it was discontinuing two of its more affordable DSLRs, the D3500 and D5600, saying it wanted to focus more on “mid to high end cameras and lenses”. Some photographers prefer mirrorless cameras as they perform to the same level but prove to be much more practical in day to day use. "I love the mirrorless cameras because they are less bulky and produce high quality photos as well," says Kipchoge Kinui, a Nairobi based photographer. "As a professional photographer working for long hours with less bulky equipment is more convenient than dealing with heavy machines, it also makes it easier to move around when shooting videos."
