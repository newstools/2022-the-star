Education cabinet secretary George Magoha said the government has constructed at least 6,500 classrooms for junior secondary schools. Speaking during the ongoing Kenya Private Schools Association (KPSA) annual conference at Pride Inn in Mombasa, Magoha said the ministry targets to have enough classrooms by January 2022. He said junior secondary schools (JSS) will be constructed in secondary schools. "Junior secondary schools shall be domiciled in secondary schools and so you have seen we have built about 6,500 classrooms already," he said. Magoha added that for primary schools that share the same compound with high schools, the classes will be constructed on the side of high schools. "For private schools that decide to invest in primary schools only, we have approved and encouraged them to build stand-alone junior secondary schools," he said. He added that the incoming government must continue to spend money to sustain the new curriculum. Meanwhile, the ministry has directed Quality Assurance and Standards officials to reinspect all private schools with a view to determining their preparedness for JSS. The pioneer class of Grade 6 learners will transition to Junior Secondary School in January 2023. Some 1.24 million candidates will sit the inaugural Kenya Primary School Education Assessment (KPSEA) under the CBC from November 28. Magoha said parents should invest time with their children during the electioneering period to keep them away from political rallies.
