Twitter has confirmed in a statement given to TechCrunch that it is testing a new status feature on some users in the US and Australia. The feature works the same way as Facebook's “How are you feeling” feature and allows users to add emojis and hashtags. This is not the first time that twitter has tested a ‘Status’ feature, before, users could post their statuses as a tweet or at the overall profile. The only difference in this feature is that the user gets to attach them to specific tweets and he or she can click on a status to discover other tweets containing the same words. “For a limited time, we are testing a feature that allows you to add a status topic from a predetermined list to your Tweets to provide more context for your followers,” Twitter told TechCrunch. “So whether you are about to drop a hot Tweet thread, share your shower thoughts, or have a bad case of the Mondays, your Tweets can better convey what you are up to.” However, Twitters testing does not mean that the feature will fully roll out globally. Let us wait and see!
