Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET)  has expressed concern over recent remarks made by Education CS George Magoha. On Thursday this week, Magoha said the government is already investing a lot in the education sector, leaving little room for a salary rise. "The government is already spending 25.9 per cent on education, although I'm not the one in salary docket, the 60 per cent the teachers are asking for is unreasonable," he said. KUPPET secretary general Akello Misori released a statement on Friday labelling Magoha's remarks uncalled for. "According to the minister, teachers are being 'unreasonable' in demanding their share of relief from economic effects that the government has acceded to at the highest levels," Misori said. Misori said teachers salary is an important element of the country's economic planning. "Not only have teachers’ incomes been eroded by high inflation in the recent years, they deserve salary reviews under the 202-2025 Public Sector Review Cycle – which they were denied last year on the false basis of the COVID-19 pandemic," Misori said. Since the year started, the two teachers unions have tabled their demands for an increase in teachers salaries. KUPPET and Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) have presented their demands to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) calling for a review of 2021-2025 CBA. Misori asked Magoha to shun teachers affairs and concentrate on the ministry of education. "As a union, we urge Magoha to keep himself busy with the many delicate matters of his Ministry and let the TSC do its job," Misori said.
