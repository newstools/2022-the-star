The new kid on the blocks in the 3,000m steeplechase Emmanuel Wafula has revealed that his love for athletics was driven by his humble background. Wafula said he has not completed his schooling due to lack of school fees as it was difficult for him to raise the money on his own. The form-three student said on many occasions he has been forced to starve due to lack of food. He said it is because of these troubles that he decided to venture into athletics. He narrated how people have been making fun of his situation back in the village "I ventured into athletes to change the lives of my people back home," he noted, adding: “I have not finished school yet due to lack of fees. Besides, I can't think of school fees when we don't even have food. There has hardly been peace at home due to this situation," Wafula said. He said he ventured into seriously athletics in 2020. "I used to make my own barriers and train on my own. It has not been an easy journey but I will not lose hope." He said he was still keen to go back to school but for now, his focus was on the World U-20 show in Cali.  Wafula won the 3,000m steeplechase in 8:32.09 at the World U-20 Championships national trials held earlier this month at the Nyayo National Stadium. Wafula is targeting gold in Colombia and will have the company of Haron Kibet. “When we go to Cali, I want to bring gold to Kenya because my people deserve to be happy. I have planned with Kibet and we are ready. I do not have any pressure because I am confident we shall win,” he said. Meanwhile, Athletics Kenya President Jack Tuwei has wished the team well and advised them to embrace teamwork.
