Fresh from winning the doubles tournament at the Wimbledon Junior championships, Angela Okutoyi has been enlisted for the Womens' Futures tournament in Tunisia and Egypt later this month. Okutoyi dedicated Saturday's win — alongside Dutch Rose Nijkamp — to Kenyans, adding that it showed the world that the country can produce world-beaters in the sport. "My win just shows we have the talent in the country and that with the right support, we can compete against the world's best,” said Okutoyi. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion said she has six weeks to prepare for the final grand slam of the year, the US Open at Flushing Meadow in New York. "I'm already thinking of the US Open. My preparations will begin shortly and am relishing the challenge of competing with the best in the world,” said Okutoyi. The teen sensation said playing in the Northampton Junior Open and training on the grass-court helped her prepare adequately for Wimbledon. “I adapted well to the grasscourt and that really helped me in Wimbledon, especially during the doubles," she said. Okutoyi and Nijkamp defeated Canadians Kalya Cross and Victoria Mboko 3-6 6-4 11-9 to bag the prestigious doubles crown at the All England Club. Okutoyi turned her attention to the doubles category after getting knocked out in the singles category by Canada's Mia Kupres 6-3 6-2 in the first round. Okutoyi 's coach Thuku Rogoi said: "It's unbelievable. Getting to a final of such a tournament is no mean feat and for me, we are just scratching the surface... we can do better.” Rogoi, a former player, hopes that Okutoyi's win will bring along the Kenyan corporates and government in supporting her future endeavours. "I hope that after all the congratulatory messages, people will support her push when she takes part in tournaments. As we speak,  she is supported by volunteers which is not ideal. She needs a full-time team working with her to harness her potential in her," added Rogoi.
