IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has warned of a possible postponement of elections for select elective seats in some areas owing to pending court cases. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chair said the ongoing cases hinder adequate preparation for the polls and as such, they will have to postpone polls for the affected areas. This, he said, will enable the electoral body to print ballot papers in time for the affected areas to have a free and fair poll. "If for any reason they (court cases) are not finalised in good time, as a commission we cannot wait forever, we shall be forced to suspend elections in those areas where decisions affect the printing of ballot papers. We must deliver elections on August 9," he said. Chebukati urged the courts to fast-track the court cases to enable them to prepare adequately for the polls. The IEBC boss made the revelations on Saturday during the Political Decency and Accountability Forum 2022 at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC). The revelations come at a time when several cases have been lodged against the IEBC. In Mombasa for instance, the court has temporarily stopped the printing of ballot papers for the Mombasa Governor seat until a case filed by Mombasa Governor aspirant Mike Mbuvi Sonko is heard and determined. Sonko moved to the court to appeal a decision by the IEBC to lock him out of the race. A case has also been filed at a Nairobi court challenging the clearance of Senator Johnson Sakaja to vie for the Governor seat. This is after a voter claimed the Senator's Teams University degree is a forgery. Due to such cases, the IEBC has halted the printing of Ballot papers to accommodate any changes that may be brought forth by a court's ruling.
