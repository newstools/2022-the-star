North Imenti MP Rahim Dawood has opposed the reverting of the Kenya Rural Roads Authority functions to county governments. Last week, Meru governor Kiraitu Murungi said that county governments should be given functions by Kenya Rural Roads Authority. The Meru governor said Kerra had failed to deliver its mandate as many roads are dilapidated. Dawood said as a legislator, he has done many roads funded under Kenya Rural Roads Authority. He spoke to the Star in his office on Wednesday. Dawood said the Sh500 million the county government is given under Kenya Roads Board should also be given to MPs under Kerra as they have been even working on roads belonging to the county. "I have done many roads under county governments legislators are only supposed to work on Class A, B and C roads but I have been doing even D, E and unclassified belong to county government and we have to write to county government in order to get permission to work on them," Dawood said. He listed a number of roads that Kerra is working on. They include KPLC- Nkoune Sh.20 million, Kinoru -Kaithe Sh. Sh.15 million, Gikongoro Bridge Sh10 million and Kianjuri-Gachiege. He said the parliamentary special sitting that was supposed to be on Wednesday but was postponed after the sitting failed to be gazetted. "I was ready but I got a message from the speaker on Tuesday afternoon that the sitting was postponed after it failed to be gazetted," Dawood said. He said whatever needed to be discussed in the sitting can wait until the next parliament because it will be late to do another sitting since many legislators are concentrating on campaigns.
