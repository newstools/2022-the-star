Kenyan software company  Crew and HR Payroll has launched a multi-company single log-in innovative HR cloud solution. The multi-company log-in module allows an individual consultant or company to manage centralized data, which facilitates payroll processing, pay slip, and report generating for different clients, under one account. Crew and HR Payroll Founder and chief executive Peter Muchemi says the innovation seeks to help freelance payroll or finance consultants in delivering their services more effectively. “The workplace model as we know it is changing. Crew HR & Payroll is dedicated to leading the way for SMEs as well as freelance payroll, tax, accountants, and finance specialists; best referred to as consultants,” Muchemi said. The solution allows a user to create one parent account and several child accounts. These child accounts will now be accounts of all  different clients. This way, one can run payroll and generate pay slips for each company. According to Muchemi freelance accountants and payroll specialists have mostly been limited to their geographical location. Especially if they run payroll manually. "With this new multi-company log-in module, these consultants can work with clients from all over the country. Increasing the clientele base creates room for more revenue generating opportunities,” said Muchemi. The new system reduces time spent on payroll  as it enables HR consultants to run payroll for all their clients simultaneously. The new solution is  an end-to-end encrypted cloud software and will allow users to have all their  clients’ data in one single account and facilitates the ability to switch from client A to client’s B account with a simple stroke of a finger. This centralized data management system will make managing users' clients easier. This feature also guarantees general better output for consultants and organizations that service various clients at the same time.
