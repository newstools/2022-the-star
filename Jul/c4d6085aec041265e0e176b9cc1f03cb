At least 19 police officers were Thursday sent to Somalia to join an ongoing peacekeeping mission under the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia. The officers drawn from various units in the National Police Service will join other personnel already in the troubled country with efforts to ensure stability. NPS has a long history of deploying officers for peacekeeping missions. Police spokesman Bruno Shioso said the officers have rendered distinguished selfless service on the African continent and around the world. “This is aimed at de-escalating violence in war-torn countries and ensuring peaceful coexistence by supporting dialogue, training, mentoring, advising and sharing experiences,” he said. NPS director of planning Patrick Ndunda and Human Capital Development deputy director Robert Mureithi met the team and urged them to display dedication and true commitment at all times in the discharge of assigned roles. Ndunda told the officers to respect the laws and customs of their host country and endeavour to bring honour through exemplary service to humanity. The Kenya Defence Forces troops are among those under Amisom that are operating in Somalia. Their aim is to suppress al Shabaab activities in the region. KDF went to Somalia in October 2011. Kenya's incursion into southern Somalia started after the kidnapping of two Spanish women, who were working for MSF at Dadaab refugee camp. The abductions were carried out by the militants who the troops planned to push away under Operation Linda Nchi. Two years later, the troops managed to take control of Kismayo port under Operation Sledge Hammer. The government saw the attacks as a threat to the country’s sovereignty as it targeted tourism, which is an economic lifeline. Somalia has not had a stable government after the fall of Siad Barre in 1991.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
