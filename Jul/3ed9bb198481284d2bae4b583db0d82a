A police officer attached to Deputy President William Ruto is admitted to the hospital after sustaining serious injuries following an altercation with a gardener at the DP's private residence in Karen, Nairobi. Police said Corporal Timothy Mugendi Rucha was hit by the gardener on the rear part of the head with an object after the altercation turned physical. It is not clear what caused the altercation that went physical at the residence at the dead hour of the night. The DP was not present at the time of the incident on Thursday morning but some of his family members were sleeping then. The officer was taken to Nairobi West Hospital in critical condition with multiple head injuries, police said. The incident happened early Thursday morning at around 12.20 am, police said. The gardener identified as Nicholas Kibiwot Rono was arrested pending arraignment. Senior police officers visited the scene after they received a report of the said assault. Those who visited the officer from Security Government Buildings said he was in a stable condition in hospital. Senior officials in the city refused to comment on the issue saying it is under probe and the life of their colleague was at stake. Police hope to wait for the injured officer to recover and record his statement, and process his P3 form for the possible arraignment of the accused. They will also talk to the accused to hear his side of the story.
