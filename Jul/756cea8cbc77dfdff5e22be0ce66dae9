Menengai Oilers finally broke a five-match losing streak to beat Strathmore Leos 12-7 to win at the Nakuru Athletic Club. The Nakuru-based side became the fifth team to win a leg of the circuit, setting the stage for a grand finish this weekend at the Kakamega Sevens. Gibson Weru 's charges had lost the Driftwood Sevens final to Mwamba and Dala Sevens final to Homeboyz but finally got the well-deserved win in front of their home fans. In a tense final, the two sides were evenly matched in the opening period with both committed to attacking, but poor decision-making cost them. Just before halftime, Oilers scored the opening try when Steve Arunga pounced on a grubber kick to touch down and Dennis Abukuse converted for a 7-0 lead at the break. On resumption, Oilers stepped up a gear, pinning Strathmore into their own half and Abukuse powered his way over the line to score an unconverted try and a 12-0 lead. Minutes later, Oilers were reduced to six men when star flyhalf Geoffrey Ominde was sent to the sin bin for persistent infringement. The varsity outfit capitalised on the advantage with Branson Madigu showing the Oilers defence a clean pair of heels to touch down with George Omoro kicking over the conversion to narrow the deficit to 12-7. Oilers, however, held on for the victory to go top of the standings with 97 points. KCB are second on 90 points as Strathmore Leos, five ahead of third-placed Leos. In the semifinals,  Oilers held off KCB 19-14 as Strathmore thrashed Homeboyz 26-5 in the second. Homeboyz beat KCB 21-10 to win the bronze medal match. Kabras RFC finished fifth after beating Quins 14-0 in the fifth-sixth playoff final and achieve their highest finish of the circuit so far this season.
