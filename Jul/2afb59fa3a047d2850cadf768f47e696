The plan to revive Mumias Sugar company has yet again suffered a blow. This is after the High Court on Thursday ordered Sarrai Group to stop operations at the Company. Rai Cement personnel, an alleged affiliate of the Sarrai Group, was also directed not to set foot at the miller premises. The directives will remain in place until a case filed in court is heard and determined. “Pending the hearing and determination of this application, Sarrai Group Limited, its directors, agents, employees, servants, subsidiaries and other affiliates including Mumias Sugar (2021) Limited, Rai Cement Limited be ordered to cease and desist any activity and all activities including the operation of machinery, dismantling, vandalism of machinery, removal of assets, or any other activity of whatever nature stored and situated within the premises of Mumias Sugar Limited,” Justice Wilfrida Okwany ruled. The court also upheld the judgement issued on April 14 that suspended the lease granted to the Sarrai group on December 22, last year. “This court issue order restraining Sarrai Group from and its aforementioned agents or any other agents from commencing, continuing, or undertaking any activity under the lease dated 22nd December 2021,” the judge stated. Sarrai has now been ordered to return all assets belonging to Mumias Sugar. Police in Mumias have been directed to ensure compliance with the directive. “The Officer Commanding Mumias Sugar Police Station be and is hereby ordered to facilitate the safe return of all vandalized and looted assets of Mumias Sugar in accordance with these orders,” the judge added. Khaminwa and Khaminwa Advocates through lawyer Jackeline Chepkemoi Kimeto had accused Sarrai Group of contempt of court.
