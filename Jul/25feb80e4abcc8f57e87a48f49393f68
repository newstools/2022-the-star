Kenya's air rifle and air pistol team will use the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup in Changwon later this month to prepare for the 2024 Paris Olympics. The 12-day competition is set for South Korea from July 9th to 21st, where Priscilla Wangui and Maurice Morara will represent the country. The former will compete in the air rifle category while the latter will take part in the air pistol cadre. Wangui, who recently met the minimum qualifying scores for Korea in the African qualifiers held in Cairo, Egypt, said: "We are heading there to benchmark and use it to gauge ourselves towards the Qualification rounds for Paris 2024,  which start in the next two months with World Championships in Cairo, Egypt," she said. Wangui was speaking on Tuesday as the Kenya team received their kit from the National Olympic Committee of Kenya ahead of their departure. The Kenya Police College instructor said she is happy at the level of development the sport is making having hosted an International Practical Shooting Confederation Level 3 event which is considered equivalent to the African Championships. “The World Cup is a great deal and it's the dream of any athlete to represent his or her country in one of the biggest global stages. Hosting high-level tournaments like the IPSC raises the profile of Kenya as a sports shooting hub and I am happy to be witnessing the transformation and growth. "I believe champions never quit. They keep trying until they get it right,” added Priscilla. The decorated athlete who received the Order of the Grand Warrior in 2018 is also among the 11 athletes on a Paris 2024 Scholarship courtesy of NOC-K. The scholarship aims to support athletes in their preparations and qualifications for the games.
