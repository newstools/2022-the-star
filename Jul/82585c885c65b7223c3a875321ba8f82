Paul Okoye of the music duo P Square has been accused by his wife, Anita Okoye, of repeatedly having an affair with their domestic worker. Anita filed a petition for a divorce in 2021. The two, who are separated for over a year now, had kept many hoping for a reconciliation. In leaked conversations, Paul allegedly invited Florence, the maid, to hotels to carry out their illicit affairs. Court documents revealed that Paul had thrown Anita and her sister out of the house when they discovered his affair with the housemaid. Screenshots of the court documents as well as leaked chats allegedly show the singer’s conversation with several women to arrange for meet-ups in hotels. Paul is said to have bragged about it and claimed it was a way to clip his wife’s wings. The couple got married in 2014 after dating for 10 years and have three children.
