World 3000m steeplechase champion and record holder Beatrice Chepkoech has pulled out of the ongoing Oregon extravaganza owing to  a stress fracture. Chepkoech flew to Netherlands to seek treatment last week and the doctor advised her against racing in Oregon as she was bound to  aggravate the injury especially when navigating the barrier. Chepkoech's absence leaves Kenya with world under 20 champion Jackline Chepkoech, 2018 world under-20 champion Cellphone Chespol and Purity Kirui for this evening's race. Chespol said they were confident of doing the country proud despite the absence of compatriot and defending champion Chepkoech. "We are focused on the task at hand but first things first and we must qualifying for the final," she noted. Chespol said they are aware of the threat posed by Kenyan-born Norah Jeruto who runs for Kazakhstan. "She is a strong athlete but we are focused on our races to ensure we qualify for the final," she added. Chespol said they have already adapted to the hot conditions in Oregon. "We have Adjusted well and trained for the last couple of days we have been here. We have also set our minds on winning," noted Chespol. Other athletes to look out for include home favourite and former champion Emma Coburn.
