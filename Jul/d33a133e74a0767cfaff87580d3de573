A section of Kiambu elders has dismissed a group that met with Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen office on Friday. The elders led by Kiama County chairman Njoroge Minae downplayed the Karen meeting saying the group met the DP has lost focus. “It is very open that there is a section of the Kiambu men that saw it fit to go to Karen but it is not from the leadership of Kiambu or Muranga. It is not us who sent the group to Karen," he said. The elders addressed the press at their shrine in Juja after they hosted the Kiambu governor James Nyoro. The elders said the Mount Kenya region is behind president Uhuru Kenyatta and his handshake partner Raila Odinga. "We have agreed that no matter what they will take from Karen, they should still come back and together we support Azimio la Umoja," Minae said. At the same time, the elders used the opportunity to campaign for governor Nyoro urging the residents of the Kiambu community to support him in the coming polls. They said the governor has transformed the county in the shortest time he has been in office. On Friday, the DP said he hosted community elders from Kiambu County led by Kiama Kìa Ma Chairman Captain (Rtd) Kung'u Muigai. He did not divulge the details of the meeting. Leaders present were his running mate Rigathi Gachagua, Speaker Justin Muturi, MPS Moses Kuria, Kimani Ichung’wah, James Wamacukuru, Simon King'ara, Njuguna Wanjiku and George Koimburi.
