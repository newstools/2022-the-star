University education and research PS Simon Nabukwesi commissioned a National Institute for Optics and Lasers laboratory at the Multimedia University on Friday. The facility which was built at a cost of Sh65million was funded by the National Research Fund while the institution bore the refurbishing cost at Sh7.5million. While commissioning the institute, Nabukwesi thanked the institution for fronting the adoption of laser technology. He highlighted the importance of this technology which he said is being implemented in several sectors in the country. “In the medical field, lasers are used to treat eyes, undertake non-invasive operations and even treat cancer,” Nabukwesi said. The launch was graced by NRF Acting CEO Jemimah Onsare and NACOSTI CEO Walter Oyawa. The NIOL lab is the first in the region and the varsity is also planning to build a laser and optics complex for research and commercialization of knowledge. Nabukwesi urged other varsities with similar plans to play an important role in spearheading the research. He said the government, through NRF and the Ministry of Education, is ready to support varsities with innovation and research projects. “Such universities will be given priority in incentives by the government and bilateral partners so that they can grow their particular niches,” Nabukwesi said. According to the institution, NIOL signed a partnership with Max Planck Society for annual financial support of Sh2.5million for research. MMU applied for a grant in 2016, and NRF awarded the varsity Sh66million in 2018 to start the establishment.
