Three suspected thugs were Monday shot and killed in two botched robbery incidents in Nairobi. Police said they recovered a pistol with four bullets from the suspects. The first incident happened in Mihango, Kayole, where two suspects were killed by police and the motorcycle they were using recovered. Police said the two had been robbing pedestrians when an alarm was raised alerting those on patrol. The suspects were later identified at the scene by some of the victims. Police said another suspect was shot and killed in Reuben slums in Mukuru, and a pistol was found on him. The suspect was in the company of two others and had been attacking and robbing residents when an alarm was raised. The bodies were moved to the mortuary as police said they had intensified operations to address such cases in the city. Residents have reported crime incidents in the city amid calls for police to take action. Police officers who have been on leave have been recalled in a marshal plan to address demands ahead of the August polls. This will see more personnel on the streets and those manning the polls before and after. During the campaign period, police say they have noticed a rise in crime incidents, especially in urban areas which prompted the move to recall those on leave. This has been worsened by gangs that follow political leaders for handouts.
