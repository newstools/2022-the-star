Over 20 people have sustained injuries following a road accident at the Nairobi Expressway, Mlolongo station. The accident involved an Embasava Sacco bus which is said to have rammed into a private vehicle, Prado TX, at the Mlolongo exit. The victims were all occupants of the bus that was moving from Nairobi to Kitengela during the incident. The accident occurred around 7:30pm on Monday. This comes a week after another accident occurred at the same station leaving one dead. Sources revealed to the Star that the private car's lonely occupant escaped unhurt. He is a Nairobi-based cop. According to eyewitnesses, the bus was speeding on the expressway before it rammed into the car whose driver was being cleared at the expressway's Mlolongo exit. Both the vehicles overturned. Rescued victims have rushed to nearby hospitals. Preliminary reports indicate that the bus might have developed mechanical problems while on the expressway resulting in brake failure. The Expressway toll station booth has been extensively damaged. Police have secured the area as rescue operations continue with members of the public milling around the scene. Four ambulances have rushed the injured persons to several hospitals including Kenyatta National Hospital, Machakos Level 5 and Shalom Community hospital.
