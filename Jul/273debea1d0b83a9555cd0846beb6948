Singer Viviane Kenya says trolls will always have an opinion about what celebrities share online. She was responding to allegations she had broken up with her bae Sam West after a viral post. Speaking to Word Is, the 'Chingi Changa' hitmaker declined to comment about the issue but said people will always judge you and talk. "Let’s all learn to be authentic. I know many fear rejection but deceit is equally bad," she said. "We all need more empathy and compassion." Speaking about her biggest regret in life, Viviane said not believing in all her superpowers sooner. "This year my main goal is to graduate. I’m back in school studying psychology. The mind and brain are interesting spaces, and I’m passionate."
