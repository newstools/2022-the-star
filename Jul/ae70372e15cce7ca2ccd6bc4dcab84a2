Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja on Monday chided his opponent Polycarp Igathe for prematurely leaving office in 2018. He claimed that the former governor Mike Sonko might not have been impeached had Igathe stayed put. Sakaja spoke during the Nairobi governor debate at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa in Karen. "Governor Sonko would not have been facing an impeachment if you had stuck in office. In fact if you stuck in office, you probably have been the incumbent governor. There would be no mess in Nairobi," he said. Sakaja added that the genesis of some of the problems facing the Capital emanated from Igathe's walk out. The governor aspirant warned that if the people of Nairobi choose Igathe on August 9, he might quit on them again if push comes to shove. Sakaja said Igathe's early exit is a matter of integrity and he should should be blamed for the consequences. "Integrity defines a leader not only in public but also in private. Integrity is not about being perfect; it's about taking responsibility," he added. On his part, Igathe defended himself saying the electorate should focus on the future, adding that he will better their lives if they elect him. "I want to assure you, Nairobi will be something of your dreams, it will be a city of your vision," he said Igathe left office abruptly in January 2018 citing lack of trust between him and Sonko. "It has been a great pleasure serving Nairobians and will continue to serve as an adviser, beyond my previous position of Nairobi county deputy governor," he tweeted as a fair well.
