Nairobi Senator and governor aspirant Johnson Sakaja is yet to make it to the Nairobi governor debate on Monday. The debate started at 8:00 pm at Catholic University of Eastern Africa in Karen without the aspirant. He only arrived at 20 minutes past the scheduled time. He was expected to make it to the second tier of the debate, to face off with his Azimio opponent Polycarp Igathe. But at 8pm, Sakaja had not yet arrived at the venue. Igathe arrived 15 minutes past 7 pm. He was accompanied by the head of the Azimio campaigns in Nairobi, Rachel Shebesh and the ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna. "We have a governor incoming who is sharp and brilliant and I think the people of Nairobi are going to see why we choose him," Shebesh said. The moderators are Zubeida Koome of KTN and NTV's Mark Masai.
