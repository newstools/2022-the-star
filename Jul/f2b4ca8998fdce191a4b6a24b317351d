Nairobi Candidate Johnson Sakaja can now breathe a sigh of relief after a case challenging his academic qualification was thrown out. Justice Anthony Mrima said petitioner Dennis Wahome failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Sakaja's degree certificate was fake. The court said Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) did not err in clearing Sakaja to run for Nairobi governor. Mrima said it was the responsibility of the petitioner to prove the allegations brought to court. The court dismissed the petition with costs citing a lack of proof. "The court finds IEBC did not err in clearing Sakaja to vie for the Nairobi gubernatorial seat," ruled Justice Anthony Mrima. The rain started beating Sakaja after four petitions were filed against him, seeking to have his clearance revoked on various grounds, including lack of educational qualifications. The IEBC Dispute Resolution Committee chaired by Wafula Chebukati commenced hearings after consolidating all four petitions. One of the petitioners, Dennis Wahome, alleged that Sakaja's degree which he reportedly acquired from Uganda's Team University was forged. The senator insisted that he holds a Bachelor of Science in Management degree conferred to him by Team University in Uganda. However, the IEBC tribunal dismissed the complaint filed against Sakaja over his academic certificates. Wahome again filed a petition wanting IEBC not to print Senator Johnson Sakaja’s name on the ballot papers. On July 1, 2022, the High court declined to temporarily bar IEBC  from including Sakaja’s name on the ballot for Nairobi’s gubernatorial contest. Instead, Justice Mrima directed that the case filed by Wahome be fast-tracked and heard last week which was later pushed to Tuesday this week. IEBC Chairperson Wafula Chebukati has since declined to revoke Sakaja's clearance.
