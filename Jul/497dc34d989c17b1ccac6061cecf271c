Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has dismissed the NCIC threat to shut down Facebook, terming it as just an opinion. He affirmed that the government will not shut down the internet or interfere with social media platforms. "We will not interfere with the internet or social media. It will not happen in our country." Speaking on Saturday, he added that the government respects the citizens' rights and the Constitution. "We will not intrude or interfere with the freedoms of our people. We have no intention... It has not been discussed anywhere within the government of shutting down social media or interfering with Facebook because of elections," he said. Matiang'i pointed out that the government condones criticism as a freedom right to Kenyans. "We are a mature government...Criticism is a way of love and we are used to it. Sometimes when citizens criticize us, it's okay that's what they are supposed to do. We work in a democratic set-up." Matiangí said Kenya has enjoyed democracy for a long time and it will be unfair to interfere with social media, taking away the freedom of its Kenyan users. "Those who have expressed their opinions on the shutdown of social media have done it in a personal capacity and we welcome the constitutional right of citizens to express themselves on matters of national interest without fear of victimization." The Interior CS said his sector will work to provide peace during the electioneering period. "We will work to make sure that those who will be voting, will do so peaceful and we will follow the directives of IEBC," he added. He urged all candidates to campaign peacefully, reminding them that they have freedom and that the government will keep respecting that. Earlier on Saturday,  ICT CS Joe Mucheru also dismissed the NCIC remarks. "Media, including social media, will continue to enjoy PRESS FREEDOM in Kenya. Not clear what legal framework NCIC plans to use to suspend Facebook. Government is on record. We are NOT shutting down the Internet."
