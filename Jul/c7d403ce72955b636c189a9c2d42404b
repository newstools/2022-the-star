Kenyan author Idza Luhumyo won the 2022 AKO Caine prize after she emerged top in the writing contest. She beat over 260 contestants to emerge the winner of the annual AKO Caine Prize. The author was awarded a prize of Sh1.4 million for the short story she submitted titled 'Five Years Next Sunday' during the event hosted on Monday, July 18. The story gravitates around a young woman who possesses the power to summon rain by her hair and commands respect from it. She had her fortunes upended after an encounter with a foreigner but has to be careful regarding the power her hair commands. While making the announcement, one of the judges, Okey Ndibe, noted that the judging panel was swayed by the protagonist's mysticism as well as her power in determining the fate of her community using her hair. “What we liked about the story was the mystical office of the protagonist, who is both ostracised and yet holds the fate of her community in her hair," stated Odibe. With the award, Luhumyo becomes the fifth Kenyan to win the writing prize after Binyavanga Wainaina (2002), Yvonne Owuor (2003), Okwiri Oduor (2014) and Makena Onjerika (2018). Other shortlisted finalists were Nigerian writer Joshua Chizoma, Ghana’s Nana-Ama Danquah, Ethiopian writer Hannah Giorgis and Billie McTernan from Ghana. The event is an annual short story award, where the prize is awarded for a short story by an African writer published in English. The winner walks away with Sh1.4 million while the other finalists walk away with roughly Sh70,000 each.
