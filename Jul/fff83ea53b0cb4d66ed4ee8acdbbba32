In the eleven penalties taken, the champions started on a wrong footing, missing two through Tedia Esilaba and Boniface Mukhekhe shooting. However, Nzoia never made this count. Despite Boniface Kweyu scoring the opener, Moses Mwale watched in disbelief as his shit was saved by Leopards goalkeeper Maxwell Muchesia.

Leopards captain Washington Munene converted with Leonard Kasembeli’s shot saved to hand the champions the lead.

Leopards assistant coach Lawrence Webo said  Nzoia gave them a match but their intentions to win were clear from the word go. “It was tough but we had no other choice but to win. We had many chances in open play but we missed. We had to recover and win on penalties,” said Webo. Nzoia head coach Salim Babu said that the loss was not good for them now that they have to prepare better for the new season. “It was a tough game. We came into this tournament to win but the best team won. We missed a number of chances which could have seen emerge champions,” said Babu.
