Ford Kenya Leader Moses Wetangula has dared the Azimio Coalition and its presidentkal candidate Raila Odinga to boycott the elections in August. Speaking in Lokichar during a campaign tour of Turkana County, Wetangula told Azimio that elections will still proceed even if Raila's team pulls out. “We want to tell that man of ‘vitendawili’ bring it on. If you boycott the elections, they will still go on with or without you,” he said. He said Raila opposed the use of the manual register in 2017 yet he is pushing for it now. Last week, Raila said the election should not be held if IEBC will not have a manual register. But Wetangula said Raila in the last election insisted on the electronic register and wondered what changed now. “You said the government cannot use millions of cash then resort to manual. Now you have made an about turn that you want the manual register,” he said. Wetangula called on Lokichar residents to come out in large numbers and vote for Kenya Kwanza. The Bungoma Senator added that the Kenya Kwanza manifesto will ensure the residents get NHIF card to access treatment in any facility. “We will have free education and once in University, 100 percent interest free loan. “he said. He said voting for Kenya Kwanza will be voting out high food prices like Unga, cooking oil and fuel.
