Mombasa has witnessed a reduction in economic activities from 2013 to 2020, a report has revealed. The reduction has seen the county’s contribution to the country’s GDP drop from 5.55 per cent to 4.72 in 2020. "From the analysis, manufacturing, electricity and transport have been declining since 2013 while construction and accommodation have remained constant," the report reads. In 2020, the report shows the contribution reduced further due to the transfer of cargo clearance from Mombasa to Naivasha Inland Container Deport. The move was effected on July 1, 2020, when the government directed that some cargo be moved via the old meter-gauge railway. According to the report by Commission for Revenue Allocation, there was no increase for the seven years reviewed. “In 2014 the county contributed 5.41 per cent, 5.24(2015), 5.21 (2016), 5.18(2017), 5.10(2018) and 5.00 percent in 2020,” the report reads. However, the county generated the second-highest own source revenue after Nairobi county with Kiambu emerging third. The range between Nairobi and Mombasa’s contribution was almost 60 per cent. “Mombasa generated 23.8 per cent of its own source revenue, following Nairobi who collected 83.2 per cent,” the report reads. "In 2018-19 Mombasa collected the highest revenue at Sh3.7 billion, in  Sh3.3 billion(2019-20) and Sh3.3bn in 2020-21." In ten years only 268,000 more people relocated to the county compared to 939,370  in 2009.
