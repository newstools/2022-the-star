Angela Okutoyi made history by becoming the first Kenyan to win a Grand Slam title when she teamed up with Dutch Rose Nijkamp to clinch the Wimbledon Junior Tennis doubles title on Saturday. The duo beat the Canadian pair of Kayla Cross and Victoria Mboko 3-6 6-4 11-9. In a tough final, Okutoyi  and Nijkamp lost the opening set but battled hard in the second, to send the match into a tie-break which they won in brilliant fashion. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion was thrilled with the victory. "We never gave up hope despite losing the first set. We regrouped and corrected our mistakes, which paid off," noted Okutoyi. The Africa junior champion revealed how she was inspired by a pep talk with world number one, Iga Swiatek of Poland. "She encouraged me and told me to give it my all and stay focused.  I'm delighted that the best is yet to come," added Okutoyi. A succession of serving errors in the opening set saw the Canadians seize the advantage, punishing Okutoyi and Nijkamp to win the opening set. However, the duo recovered and never looked back, clinching the title amidst Okutoyi's disbelief.
