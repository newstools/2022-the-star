The murder trial of Migori Governor Okoth Obado failed to go on Thursday following complaints by the defence that they were not supplied with documentary evidence being relied on by a witness. The witness is from the National Transport and Safety Authority. The witness had already taken the stand but was stood down after lawyers Kioko Kilukumi and Roders Sagana said they were not served with the document and it also failed to satisfy the requirements of the evidence Act. Baraqo Baji, the prosecution's 25th witness, was referring to a document detailing the registration details of a motor vehicle believed to have been used during the abduction of Sharon Otieno (now deceased). The vehicle is a Toyota Fielder KCL 481K. The witness, who works under the registration department, told trial judge Cecilia Githua that they had received a request letter from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations regarding the said vehicle and another KCF 519F. DCI sought to know the current and past owners of the vehicle and any other relevant information. From the NTSA record, the KCL was imported by Saidi Kalu. It originated from Japan and registered on April 28, 2017. On August 31, 2018, the vehicle was transferred to Adhiambo Oloo Olivia. The registration details of the vehicle remain under her name to date. The defence was opposed to the documents, citing issues with certification. Judge Githua adjourned the matter to October 31 as the state works on serving the defence with the requisite documents. Obado, his personal aides Micheal Oyamo and Caspal Obiero are in court facing trial over the murder of Sharon and her unborn baby. The three and others not before court are accused of committing the crime on September 3, 2018 at Owade, Homa Bay county. Seventeen more witnesses remain before the prosecution closes its case.
