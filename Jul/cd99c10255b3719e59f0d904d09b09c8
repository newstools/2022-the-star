Barely two days after a grisly road accident in Taru, which claimed 21 lives, another fatal accident was on Sunday witnessed in Kombani in Kwale county. The accident involved a Toyota V8 Land Cruiser and a PSV matatu at Kombani junction. One person died on the spot and over four others are nursing serious injuries. According to the area assistant chief Hamisi Mwavyoga, the Land Cruiser was heading to Likoni from Ukunda while the matatu was waiting for passengers when the accident occurred. The driver of the Land Cruiser was speeding when he lost control of the vehicle and rammed into the stationary matatu. “The Land Cruiser was moving at a high speed before it hit a road bump, lost control and went to hit the stationary matatu,” he said. The matatu driver lost his legs while four other passengers sustained severe injuries. They were unconscious when police took them to Kwale subcounty hospital. The Land Cruiser had carried five passengers, who sustained minor cuts. It is believed that the Land Cruiser was in a hurry to overtake the car in front of it. According to witness Ali Juma, the driver of the vehicle in front of the Land Cruiser managed to see the bump but the Land Cruiser's driver had miscalculated forcing him to hold emergency breaks. "There were like seven different vehicles coming at a high speed, luckily they all saw the bump and reduced the speed, but the Land Cruiser failed," he said. Juma said due to the instant breaks, the Land Cruiser drifted high above the ground before hitting the matatu. The dead was identified as a recovering addict living in Likoni, Mombasa county. He was going for his dose at Kombani Methadone Health Centre in Matuga subcounty.
