Ulinzi Warriors tackle Strathmore University Blades in a crucial Kenya Basketball Federation League (KNBL) encounter at Nyayo National Stadium gymnasium on Sunday. Ben Mufutu, the soldiers’ new tactician, said they have trained well and are ready for the battle ahead. “They are young and energetic, but we are ready for them. It should be a good match. They crush the boards and so we will have to defend well,” he said. The students’ coach, Tony Ochieng, on the other hand, said he is confident of getting a positive result from this epic match-up. “The team is fine, we have the experience to give the former champions a run for their money and finish the first round fixtures strongly,” said Ochieng. “My only worry is that we have gone for a long spell without a league match.” The Warriors have played five games and won four, garnering nine points while the Swords have seven points from four matches — three wins and a loss.
