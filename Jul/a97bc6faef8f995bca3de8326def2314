Githeri is a simple, budget-friendly yet incredibly delicious dish whose main ingredients are boiled maize and beans. The dish is prepared differently across all regions of Kenya. Some may include vegetables like cabbage or spinach, others may use chickpeas instead of beans, while some may include arrowroot or potatoes. Other ingredients such as meat/vegetables can be added to enhance the taste and flavour of the meal. Githeri's origin can be traced to central Kenya, however, the meal is common in all parts of the country albeit with different names. From Mutheri, Muthere to Succotash. Githeri is one of Kenya’s staple meals. Ingredients Step 1 Boil your fresh maize and an equal amount of beans in a sufuria filled with water. Alternatively, you can buy pre-cooked maize and beans at the market. If you choose to buy them pre-cooked, ensure you wash them thoroughly before adding them. Step 2 Wash and chop all your vegetables accordingly and set them aside. Place the sufuria over medium heat then add cooking oil and fry the onions with a teaspoon of ginger powder till they are golden. Step 3 Add garlic, sliced potatoes, ground coriander, and chopped green pepper, stir while allowing them to cook. Add 1/2 cup of water so that they don't stick to the sufuria. Step 4 Add tomatoes, the desired amount of salt and cumin then combine. Step 5 Cover until the tomatoes are well cooked into a soft sauce, then add your cooked maize and beans with sliced chillies. Stir until everything is well combined. Step 6 Cover and allow it to simmer for a minute or two over low heat adding your coconut milk (if desired). Step 7 Serve having garnished with cabbage or spinach and enjoy with a slice of fresh avocado.
