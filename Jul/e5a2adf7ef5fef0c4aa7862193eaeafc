Boris Johnson will resign as Conservative leader today - he will continue as Prime Minister until the autumn. This is to allow a new leadership contest to take place. A Conservative leadership race will take place this summer and a new Prime Minister will be in place in time for the Tory party conference in October. A No 10 source says Mr Johnson spoke to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, to inform him of his decision. "The Prime Minister has spoken to Graham Brady and agreed to stand down in time for a new leader to be in place by the conference in October," the source says.
