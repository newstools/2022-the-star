Despite the lack of quality training equipment, Kwale Judo club manager and senior coach Zablon Masha is impressed with the results the players are posting at the African Judo Championships Cadet at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Masha noted that judo is an expensive sport and lack of the required equipment makes training an uphill task. He added that most of the youngsters are from humble backgrounds and they join the sport to get an allowance to boost themselves. “Judo is expensive. Our biggest challenge is lack of kit and this makes training a bit difficult. I am happy with what the players are doing so far and I believe they will make it to the finals and eventually qualify for the Youth Championships,” Masha said. “Most of these kids come from poor backgrounds and they are here to play well and get a token of appreciation. This helps them pay their school fees and cater for basic needs. However, only those who are in the national team are given a good allowance.” Masha also highlighted that judo has helped keep the youngsters busy and away from social vices. "Engaging in these games has helped them to be disciplined and healthy. It helps them avoid engaging in unnecessary activities," he said. Mombasa-based judoka David Katana expressed his excitement after qualifying for the final in the championships. He also mentioned that they struggle to train and if they get support, then judo will go far. “I am happy to have qualified for the finals. I started playing judo sometime back and the opportunities have started coming through. It takes perseverance to get to this level and I hope these opportunities never run out,” Katana said. “We do not have quality training kits and mats and this makes training uncomfortable. Getting the equipment will be a great relief for us.”
