Despite beating Kenya Forest Service 3-1 in the men's national volleyball league at the Nyayo Stadium on Friday, Trail Blazers coach Geoffrey Omondi reiterated the need to collect maximum points against Nairobi Prisons to guarantee themselves a playoffs slot. Newbies Trail Blazers were a cut above their rivals,  powering to victory in sets of 25 - 18, 25-22, 20-25, and 25-19. Omondi said his charges cannot afford to rest on their laurels and must instead remain focused ahead of their next match. "I have never played a tougher match like this one, owing to its importance. We are 60 percent into the playoffs but we still need to beat Nairobi Prisons to be assured of a slot," the former national men's coach remarked. "Complacency crept in the third set and the setback was a wake-up call for the playing unit. We failed to contain their best attacker and he tormented us at will. We devised a way to contain their attackers through blocks and they had no answer for our dominance," he added. He added: "However, this is not the time to celebrate. We still have an ardouos task ahead. We need to be watertight in blocks, sharp on attack and spot on in reception. "Determined to silence critics, Trail Blazers led 14-10 at the first technical time out before hard-hitters Juliard Mbappe and Sialo Omondi proved the difference for the newbies who won 25-18. KFS surrendered 4-1 lead in the second set to trail 10-12, 20-23 and lost 22-25 with a lack of coordination in attack haunting KFS. Forest emerged from the ashes to take the third set 25-20 but that was a consolation as Trail Blazers prevailed 25-19 to win the decider. In other matches of the day, Equity Bank trounced Administration Police (AP) Kenya 3-1 in sets of 25-17, 25-17, 22-25 and 25-21, and Nairobi Prisons won by the same scoreline against Vihiga in sets of 25-18, 25-19, 20-25 and 25-22 while Western Prisons whitewashed Vihiga 3-1 (25-18, 25-23, 20-25, 25-16).
