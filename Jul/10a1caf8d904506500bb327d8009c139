Agano party running mate Ruth Mucheru has downplayed the affect of the so called tyranny of numbers in the forthcoming general election. Mucheru said together with her presidential candidate David Waihiga, they are not scared of the mystical numbers believed to have been determining the winner of previous presidential elections. "We are here to change perceptions and bring the change that Kenyans expect. This is a new leadership, we are not scared of the fact that there are tyranny of numbers," Mucheru said. "Those are numbers, but the factual fact is Wakenya wamechoka," she added. "Agano iko site, watu wakate simu," she said. Her Roots Party counterpart echoed her sentiments saying it's time to change Kenyans mindset into believing that even the minority can lead the country. "Tyranny of numbers has been used all the time saying our people our people. But it's time for Kenyans to ask themselves how these leaders have benefited them. "So we are bringing a change of mind set so that Kenyans can become selfish and say even though my tribe is ruling, I have not benefited but these ones even though they are not from my tribe will bring change. So, I'm not scared of anyone," Wamae said. They spoke during the deputy presidential debate on Tuesday, July 19, 2022 at the Catholic University for East Africa (CUEA), Nairobi.
