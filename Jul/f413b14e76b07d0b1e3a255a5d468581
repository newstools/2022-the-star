Kakamega county Kenya Kwanza gubernatorial running mate  Beatrice Inyangala has asked Kenyans to maintain peace as the country enters the last stretch of the August 9 elections campaigns. Inyangala who is the running mate of Senator Cleophas Malala in the gubernatorial race has also asked the security agencies to beef up security, especially for the female candidates across the country. While addressing the press today(Friday) in a Malava hotel she said she was proud to represent the voice of Women in politics. Inyangala condemned acts of violence and intimidation meted on female candidates involved in politics. “Malava has been identified by the security agencies as a hot spot for violence and indeed we have witnessed some incidents of violence as we went around our political activities. But this will not demoralize us. However, I wish to appeal to the people of Malava, Kakamega and the Kenyans at large to run their campaigns peacefully. "Elections will come and pass, but we shall remain Brothers and Sisters. Let’s stretch our arms, hold each other and build this country together.” She said And added, “We need each other and we need to harness our diversity as a strength rather than a dividing factor,” she reiterated. Inyangala noted that in Kakamega, there are 900 thousand women whose voices are not heard and so they always remain disadvantaged. “Women let families are always affected more by every issue that comes around, be it famine, violence, abuse and so on. That’s why they should be involved in policy formulation and other development agendas,” She stated She further said it was prudent for Kenyans to embrace each other regardless of their party affiliations.
