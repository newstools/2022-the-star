Pastor James Ng'ang'a castigated Roots party presidential candidate George Wajackoyah over his manifesto on legalising bhang. Ng'ang'a said Wajackoyah's agenda on bhang legalisation and selling of hyena testicles in a bid to earn mover revenues, was against the country's morals. He claimed to legalise the consumption of marijuana was lawless and would damage morals among young people. "Nimesema katika jina la yesu hamtaleta laana Kenya ya kuua watoto na bangi," he said. Loosely translates to: "I have said in the name of the Lord, you will not bring curses to Kenya. Bhang will end up killing our children." Speaking during a sermon at Neno Evangelism church, he said Wajackoyah should be careful with his utterances and know some things are not acceptable in Kenya. Ng'ang'a stated that if fighting the leader of the Roots Party meant stopping him, he would do it and would go to extra lengths to stop his agenda. "I'm 69 years old and you are only 62 years old, you are my junior and I will attack you over your agenda. And when we meet, it's either you knock off my teeth or I knock off yours," Ng'ang'a said. He further criticized Wajackoyah's policies on selling hyenas testicles and introducing snake farming to boost the country's revenues. "You clearly don't care but we will show you how to care," Ng'ang'a said. Wajackoyah had made the proposition that Kenya will export hyena meat and testicles as part of raising revenue to offset the country’s ballooning public debt.
