A man who pleaded guilty to assault and attempted robbery has been sentenced to two years in prison. Steven Saruni was sentenced by resident magistrate Daniel Ngayo. He was accused of attacking Amos Ng'etich in Ololung’a, Narok South subcounty, at 9pm on June 14. Ng'etich was on his way home from a traditional ceremony at his friend’s place when he was accosted by Saruni and his accomplice. According to the police report, the complainant was attacked by the accused and another man before they escaped on a motorcycle. However, after a few metres, the motorcycle crashed and the two ran away leaving the vehicle behind. Ng'etich then called his friend who picked him up and took him to a health facility. The following day, he reported the attack to the village elder who advised him to report it to the police, which he did. A few days later Saruni was arrested and was positively identified by the complainant. In his mitigation, Saruni pleaded for leniency. He asked for forgiveness, saying his children depend on him. Resident magistrate Ngayo sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment for the first count and one-year imprisonment for the second count. The sentences will run concurrently. Edited by Josephine M.
