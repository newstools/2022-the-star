Kenyan Premier League club Wazito kicked off training in earnest early Monday to prepare for the promotion/relegation playoffs against Murang’a Seal later in the month. Wazito toiled up to the last day of the concluded season to shake off a relegation scare following a torrid run in their fixtures where they blew both hot and cold. After the hype, pomp, and colour that characterized their grand entry into top-flight football, Wazito were reduced to a laughing stock as they grappled with a tragic combination of financial constraints and miserable results. Murang'a Seal wrapped up third in the National Super League with 65 points behind champions APS Bomet and Fortune Sacco respectively. Seal secured a lifeline after playing out to a one-all draw against AP at the IAAF Stadium on Sunday. Fortune Sacco gained promotion to the top tier on Sunday following their walkover against Gusii FC at Kianyaga Stadium. The Kirinyaga-based lads joined APS Bomet who also sealed an automatic spot after topping the NSL standings earlier in the month. Fortune's fans went into frenzied celebration as it became evident the side would grace the big stage next season. Fortune have featured in the country's second tier for four seasons following their promotion in October 2018 after concluding the Division One competition with 57 points, 11 clear of second-placed Naivas FC. Central Kenya could make history by sending two teams to the KPL if Murang’a Seal, who emerged third with 61 points, manage to surmount Wazito in the promotion/relegation battle. Wazito wrapped up the season second from bottom in the top-tier competition last season where Vihiga Bullets got demoted. Muhoroni Youth's dreams of making a grand return to the KPL were shattered after they finished fourth with 62 points. Muhoroni Youth wrapped up the season with a one-all draw against Shabana.
