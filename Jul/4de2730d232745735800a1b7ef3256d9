Netflix has launched support for spacial technology for which no surround speakers or home theatre will be required. Spacial audio is a 3D frequency that involves the virtual placement of sound sources anywhere in three dimensions. What does spatial sound do? Spatial audio with dynamic head tracking brings theater-like sound from the movie or video you are watching, so that the sound seems as if it is coming from all around you. This comes as a collaboration between Netflix and Sennheiser to bring the cinematic experience of immersive audio to users on normal devices. Spatial audio will roll out beginning today, and you can hear it for yourself by typing “spatial audio” into the search bar and selecting a show or film that is supported in the search results. This magical combination of sight and sound will bring viewers closer to the story, and Netflix will add this capability to other features they support like 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Calibrated Mode.
