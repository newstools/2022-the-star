Cooking beef is very easy as long as you are patient during the process, rushing tends to lead to tough and chewy beef. For a more concentrated flavour, try cooking your beef without covering it with a lid, then add tomatoes to give you more room to play with flavours and spices. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Pre boil your beef in salty water for 10 minutes. Step 2 Add 2 tablespoon of oil to a pan and fry the beef over medium heat until it browns slightly. Add your spices and onions and cook for 15 minutes. Step 3 While the beef is cooking blend the tomatoes, bell peppers with 1 large onion and transfer to the pan with the beef. Reduce the heat and let it simmer. Step 4 Add in tomato paste and a cup of water or meat stock into the thickened stew base. Stir to form a broth. Step 5 Lower heat, add fried beef to the stew, stir, tasting frequently while adding the desired seasoning. Cover pan and let stew simmer for another 5 mins so that the meat can tender while absorbing the stew flavours. Serve hot with rice, Ugali or pasta and enjoy with friends and family.
