With 22 days to go the general elections, Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chair Wafula Chebukati's spouse has called on Kenyans to pray for him. "Naomba tu mtuombee, mtuombee kama familia wakati huu wenye tunaingia hii uchaguzi, mimi naomba mtuombee sababu mimi najua mzee kitu kimoja anataka tu kufuata sheria." Loosely translates to: (Please pray for our family, especially during this electioneering period. All I know is my husband wants to follow the law). Speaking during a funeral service on Saturday, Mary opened up on how her husband’s work has kept him away from his family. “Saa zingine tunamwonaga kwa tv zaidi ata kuliko tunavyomwona nyumbani sababu ya hii kazi," she said. Loosely translates to: (Most times we see him on TV even more than we see him physically because of his work but I’m thankful he is here today) She noted that during the last election their family was deeply worried but this year they are stronger. "Ile election ingine watoto walikuwa na huzuni sana lakini sasa wako na nguvu na hata yeye mwenyewe ako na nguvu na kila siku tunamuombea tukisema Mungu ampatie wisdom, Mungu shower him with the blood of Jesus ili atumikie nchi hii." Loosely translates to: (Our children were deeply affected by the last election exercise but now they are strong, and so is Chebukati. We always pray for God's wisdom to guide him as he serves the nation) On January 18, 2017 President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Chebukati as the chairman of the electoral agency taking over from Issack Hassan. Together with a team of six commissioners, Chebukati oversaw the 2017  General elections which had a repetition of the presidential elections in October where President Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto were declared winners. With this year’s election, Chebukati has been under pressure to ensure the election is free and fair, devoured of any glitches.
