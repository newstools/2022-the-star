Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has challenged Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairperson Wafula Chebukati to deliver a free, fair and credible election. Kalonzo who was speaking in Kajiado county during the launch of Kitengela municipality said there were obvious shortfalls in the election state of preparedness. He said the shortfall is coupled with suspicion of procurement. "We will not sleep, we want our friends in IEBC to take responsibility because we respect them. Personally I have confidence in Chebukati, I know him even if sometimes its hard to know if he is laughing or mad, but we want him and his team to deliver a credible election for once," he said. Kalonzo who also campaigned for Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, said IEBC must avoid mistakes that may result to nullification of election results as was the case in 2017. "I have seen his competitor, has started claiming that Azimio has sensed defeat, I want to tell him, in Azimio, we don't fear, we are winners." On July 11, Chebukati affirmed that there is no plot to rig the August elections. He accused some politicians of spreading propaganda and asked Kenyans not to allow themselves to be deceived. "I want to confirm that IEBC is an independent institution. We are not directed by any individual, constitution or authority. We are answerable only to the constitution," he said. Recently, IEBC has been experiencing hitches in their operations but Chebukati maintained that the elections will be fair.
