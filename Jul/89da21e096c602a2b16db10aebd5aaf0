Nairobi County woman representative Esther Passaris has supported the decision of Salary and Remuneration Commission (SRC) opposing a proposition by outgoing governors to receive a pension. The governors and their deputies were seeking a lifetime pension of up to Sh2.3 billion annually. They sought a monthly pension of Sh739,200 (governors) and Sh700,000 (deputies) respectively. Apart from the pay, they were seeking a lump sum payment equivalent to their one-year pay, a 3,000cc four-wheel-drive car, fuel allowance, a driver, a personal assistant and a medical cover for local and overseas treatment, a move that has been disputed by SRC. Passaris, in an interview with KTN News on Monday, said the SRC made the correct decision helping tax payers who are already overburdened by increasing cost of living. "The governors think they are entitled to a lifetime support provided by state but Kenyans cannot afford that, I really side with the SRC," she said. Passaris said the economy is already deteriorating and the county bosses are asking for too much. "Governors are leaving offices richer than they came, and they are not entitled to what they are asking for," she added. The incumbent woman representative added the governors should consider a justified and approved retirement package. The Council of Governors (CoG) argues that other countries with devolved governments like Nigeria or South Africa provide a pension for their governors. The commission says it agreed with the CoG in January 2020 in setting up a pension scheme for State officers in the county, including governors and deputies. It followed the release of guidelines that had two types of benefits for State officers serving in counties which were a contributory pension or gratuity. SRC further said that governors have no mandate to set allowances.
