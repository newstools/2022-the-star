Singer Kelvin 'Bahati' Kioko was on Monday chased away at an Azimio rally in Nairobi. Bahati who attended the rally graced by top Nairobi leaders of the Azimio coalition was forced out of the meeting even before he could address his supporters. The rally was held at his Mathare Constituency where he is seeking to represent them on a Jubilee party ticket. In a viral video seen by the Star, some Azimio leaders are seen gesturing him to exit the stage. The group had mounted a makeshift dais on their cars. Leaders who seemingly wanted Bahati out forced him down the car as they pointed at him using their hands. After hitting the ground, Bahati is seen being roughed up by a group of men even as his security details try to intervene. This comes a week after Bahati and the ODM secretary general Edwin Sifuna got into a bitter verbal exchange. Sifuna had announced that Azimio had settled on the incumbent Mathare MP Anthony Oluoch to fly their flag in the August 9 election. "Zoning was done perfectly even here in Mathare we have agreed that it's an ODM zone. We only have one candidate in Mathare and that is Oluoch, this young man called Bahati is my younger brother and we will talk. I will make sure that we find him another position within the Azimio government," Sifuna said. Bahati responded to the SG saying he won't quit the race even as he asked him to keep off affairs of Jubilee party aspirants. "My point and message to Mathare people is that I am still in the race and I will be on the ballot. I am not stepping down for anyone". The Azimio zoning plan has brought infightings in the Coalition. A section of candidates has said they will not step down even as they dismissed the zoning plan. Among those who refuted the plans is Jubilee’s Makadara candidate Mark Ndung’u who has vowed not to step down for Makadara MP George Aladwa.
