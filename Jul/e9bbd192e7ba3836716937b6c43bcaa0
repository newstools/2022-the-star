Head coach Salim Babu has assured Nzoia Sugar fans that he is at the club to stay, rubbishing rumours of joining Kakamega Homeboyz. Speaking in Kakamega on Sunday after falling to AFC Leopards in the final of the inaugural Lodonde football tournament, Babu said he has no intentions of joining any other club. “As we speak, I belong to Nzoia Sugar. Any stories out there are mere rumours. I have dedicated my life to this team and I want to do well with them next season,” said Babu. Eight days ago, Kakamega Homeboyz management fired their head coach Bernard Mwalala after falling short of the Kenyan Premier League title, finishing second to defending champions Tusker. Immediately, the rumour mills spewed stories of how Babu is favourite to replace Mwalala at the Kakamega-based club. But Babu, who decamped from National Super League side Kisumu Allstars in January, added: “We are building a very strong team for the next season and through this, we must build confidence among our players to ensure that we get quality results. As a club, we already have a way forward, which will guide us in our season,” said Babu. The Bungoma-based Nzoia finished 14th in the 2021/22 KPL season after accumulating 37 points from 34 matches. Playing their home matches at the Sudi Stadium, located within the Nzoia Sugar factory farm, the team scored 36 goals and conceded 39. “When you are building a team, you need to stick to it for better results and that will be achieved next season. We cannot leave the team at this point in time,” added Babu.
