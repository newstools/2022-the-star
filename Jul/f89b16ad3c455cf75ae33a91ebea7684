More than 12,600 residents in Eldas will benefit from the Sh60 million Tula Tula Water Project. Residents of Tula Tula in Eldas will no longer walk for tens of kilometres in search of water. The government through the Northern Water Works Development Agency implemented the water project that will serve both domestic and livestock needs. Water PS Joseph Njoroge who commissioned the project on Tuesday said the government is working to ensure all Kenyans have ease of access to water. “We have nine agencies spread across the country to make sure that Kenyans have access to water. NWWDA covers Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Samburu, Marsabit and Isiolo counties. "We have water projects in all these counties, some have already been commissioned, while others will be ready soon,” he said. Eldas MP Adan Keynan, thanked the government for initiating water projects in Northeastern, to mitigate the effects of drought. NWWDA chairman Osman Issack said there has been an acute water shortage caused by recurring drought over the past three years. “With the support from the government, we will drill more boreholes and continue water trucking, to supply water to our pastoralists in the grazing areas,” he said. Issack further said there is need to harvest rain water, especially in a county, which has been faced with floods. “We need a sustainable plan for water storage. To construct larger dams and harvest rainwater, which can be used for agriculture and serve us for a long time,” he said. The chairman urged residents to guard the water infrastructure from vandalism, which would take them back to water shortage. “Our work is to lay the infrastructure and make sure everything is working, then hand over the project to the county government. "We want to come back and do more projects, not start repairing broken ones,” he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
