Independent Medico Legal Unit (IMLU) has called for the immediate suspension of Nakuru County Commander Peter Mwanzo. IMLU called on Wednesday for the action following the alleged extra-judicial killings of four suspected 'Confirm' gang members by the police. "Our preliminary findings point to a police service gone rogue, it is not beyond imagination that the execution of the four was premeditated planed and executed,"IMLU Executive Director, Peter Kiama said. "We condemn the heinous act and immediately call for suspension and investigations of the Commander's responsibilities in this incident," stated Kiama. He said the reports from the postmortem showed the victims were shot in close range with two kneeling and the others standing. "The report shows that three sustained gun shots from behind and one  in the side with no defensive wound on their bodies," Kiama added. Nakuru Police Commander Peter Mwanzo had previously confirmed on Friday that the suspects were gunned down by police who were on night patrol. Mwanzo said there had been speculation that members of the gang  previously killed two people in that area after the police received a tip from the community. The IMLU Director condemned the police for failing to respect the rule of law and human life. Kiama said incidents where the police take action without considering the law has increased. "In 2020 and 2021 we recorded 115 cases with an increase of 80 per cent compared to previous years spread country wide," he noted. He asked Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) and Internal Affairs Unit to thoroughly investigate the killings of four suspected 'Confirm' gang members. "I call upon the government to reinforce the core duty of police in protecting life and respecting human rights," IMLU Director added. Kiama said the witnesses willing to give evidence of the incident is to be placed under protection.
