A letter indicating Kisii Governor James Ongwae is joining UDA is fake It is dated July 23 and has the county symbol of Kisii but lacks Ongwae’s signature. “The right of democracy is enshrined and entranced in the Constitution of Kenya and it’s my pleasure to inform the public and my supporters about my move to join UDA party which I believe will form the next government both in the county and the national level,” reads the letter. “I wish to thank HE Raila Amollo Odinga, the ODM party leader whom I have worked with for a very long time and a time comes when personal interests supersede any other person’s interests thus my decision is engineered by factors that I consider important to me,” it reads. The Star has however established that the letter is misleading and fake as it was not authored by Ongwae. Ongwae termed the letter as fake on July 27, 2022. “Ignore the baseless UDA claims. I have been with Baba for over 20 years and I will for eternity. Besides politics, he is my personal friend for life. Let’s make him our fifth president,” he posted on his social media platforms. The content of the fake letter has widely been shared on social media and Kenyans have been asked to disregard it.
