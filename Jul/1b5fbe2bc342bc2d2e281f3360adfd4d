Despite advocating for the legalisation of bhang, Roots party presidential candidate Justina Wambui Wamae has said she has never taken the narcotic. Wamae who graced the first session of the deputy presidential debate on Tuesday also said she will never take bhang even if they win the presidency. “I have never taken Bhang and I will never take bhang. Let me tell you Zubeidah, we are here to open markets in Kenya,” she said. “Many people have mental challenges because of high cost of living, not Marijuana. I have never smoked bhang and I will never smoke bhang.” Wamae said marijuana legalisation is to help in the purification process. “We have a challenge mainly corruption but this comes from a scarcity mentality. Everyone wants to go to politics where there is money so we will be purifying the scarcity mentality and we will purify them,” she said. She said in their manifesto, they are advocating for a special species of bhang. "The bhang is not for smoking but undustraisation," she said. More to follow
