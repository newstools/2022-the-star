Police in Solai, Nakuru County and Unguja in Siaya County are in search of suspects found in possession of bhang. On Tuesday, officers in Solai uprooted 364 stems of bhang from a farm allegedly owned by Joseph Ng'ang'a. The NPS reported that the suspect is still at large and efforts to have him arrested and arraigned have been intensified. In a separate incident, police officers from Unguja Police Station, Siaya County, recovered 347 rolls of bhang stuck in a suitcase and a safari bag belonging to suspects who had booked to travel in a Nairobi-bound bus. "The suspects, believed to have been minors, abandoned the haul and escaped upon being questioned by the company staff over the contents of their luggage," NPS said. The Service said investigations are underway to identify the suspects and the owners of the recovered drugs. The NPS, through the Children and Gender Desks across the country, has reiterated their advocacy for the rights and well-being of children. "We remind the public, particularly parents, of their role in protecting children from any form of exposure to drug trafficking and abuse as envisaged by being Children Act No. 8 of 2001," the Service said. The Service warned that trafficking bhang is a serious offence and attracts hefty penalties.
