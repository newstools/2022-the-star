Voters are getting to a stage of putting their identification papers ready for August 9. The polls, probably the most-hyped in recent memory, must never be the subject of protracted feuds as to whether they were free and fair. Only five years ago, Raila Odinga, then running as the Nasa candidate, challenged the victory of President Uhuru Kenyatta (Jubilee) and got the Supreme Court to nullify the presidential election results. The more sympathetic views saw the verdict as demonstration the Judiciary is independent of the Executive. But the uncomfortable truth is that it was an expensive indictment of the IEBC’s ability to deliver credible results – figures that can be verified. We hope that the electoral commission will make every effort, turn every stone and spend every shilling to ensure the tensions that stem from an election whose credibility is suspect does not rear its ugly head ever again. The agency carried out a dry run of poll transmission technology on Tuesday. The results have yet to allay fears that everything will run according to plan. Chairman Wafula Chebukati and his team must not let Kenyans down. Failure is not an option.
