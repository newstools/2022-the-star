Police in Kiminini, Trans Nzoia county, are searching for the suspect in the killing of a police reservist whose mutilated body was found in a sugarcane plantation. Kiminini police commander John Onditi said the body of Evans Barasa was found at Amagoro area on Monday. The motive was not known and residents were shocked and fearful because the NPR's G3 assault rifle was stolen. Onditi shared preliminary findings, which indicated Barasa was with an NPR colleague, Patrick Wekesa, before he was lured to his death by a person allegedly known to him. According to records at Kiminini police station, the two reservists had been assigned to Peter Baraza’s farm in Amagoro village. "We have since established a Mr Khakalukha Khamaibendi, 20 years, signaled Barasa into the sugarcane plantation, pretending to show him something," said Onditi. Onditi said Khamaibendi, who is lead suspect, had requested Barasa's colleague not to accompany them into the plantation. The suspect was still at large by press time. The mutilated body was hidden under a stack of cut sugarcane. "The body was covered with leaves," Onditi said. He said security officers were holding in custody Frederick Makhokha, 72, who is assisting with investigations into the murder. His connection to the case was not immediately established. The official said a G3 assault rifle, which was in Barasa's possession, had not been recovered. Onditi urged members of the public to be on high alert and immediately raise the alarm if they spotted the suspect or might know where the rifle was. Nyumba Kumi chairman John Kidula said he was apprehensive the weapon could be used by the assailant to cause more deaths of innocent citizens. The body was moved to Kitale County Hospital mortuary.
