Trans Nzoia county has pledged to work in partnership with farmers and private stakeholders to increase productivity and food security. During an empowerment meeting for farmers in Kitale, Agriculture CEC Maria Nzomo said transformation of the sector needs the widest stakeholders’ participation. “In order to advance modernised farming, a variety of modern farm machinery and equipment was produced in the first term. This greatly boosted production," Nzomo said. The CEC said seven tractors, two mobile driers, two boom sprayers, two harrows, three chisel ploughs and one hay baler were among the equipment procured. The county has made big strides in improving the agricultural sector. She encouraged the private sector to be part of the collaboration, saying there is quite a long way to go. She said since the continuous implementation of the soil specific subsidy programme, many farmers in the five subcounties have realised increased farm income and improved livelihoods. The CEC, who chairs the National CECs Council, said food production had declined over the years and called for concerted efforts from the private sector  to boost food sufficiency and self-reliance. She said Kenyan farmers will reap great benefits from the reforms put in place by the outgoing administration. The benefits may not be realised at once but in the near future all residents will benefit greatly from the efforts of Governor Patrick Khaemba who worked behind the scenes, she said. She said the governor’s initiative will guarantee food security even after his retirement from public office. The intended beneficiaries are among 20,456  smallholders in the five subcounties of Trans Nzoia East, Trans Nzoia West, Kwanza, Kiminini and Endebess. (Edited by V. Graham)
