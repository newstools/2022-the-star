Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto is on spot for making remarks perceived as condescending and Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu. The DP was on a campaign trail in Kitui county when he apparently questioned where Ngilu had gone. He, however, went off his speech and began questioning her marriageability. "Na ule mama(seemingly Ngilu) alienda aje (Where did that woman go to)?" the DP posed to the crowd. It is then that a section of the crowd shouted: "Alienda Bondo (She went to Bondo)". The DP then posed: " Aliendaje Bondo, mlikataza yeye kura( How did she go to Bondo, did you deny her votes)?" The DP's question is in reference to Ngilu's move to quit the governor race. A person in the crowd shouted: "Aliolewa Bondo (She was married in Bondo)". Bondo is where the rural home of ODM Raila Odinga is located. Ngilu, an ardent critic of DP Rutop, is backing Raila for the presidency. It is then that the DP responded to the random comment asking:  "Kwani mama mzee hivi anaweza kuolewa? Ataolewa na nani? (Can such an old woman be married? Who will marry her)?". The remarks have elicited sharp reactions among Kenyans on social media with some claiming the DP disrespected the governor. Here are remarks from Kenyans:
