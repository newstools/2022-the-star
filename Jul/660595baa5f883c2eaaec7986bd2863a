Kajiado County Senator Philip Mpaayei has ditched DP William Ruto's camp for Raila Odinga. He was received at Azimio camp by Kajiado Governor Joseph Ole LENKU. Mpaayei while joining Raila Odinga's Azimio said he was treated with injustice in his former party, UDA. He at the same time alleged that he was rigged out during party nominations. "The reality has now dawned on me. UDA craftily rigged me out and replaced me with a weak candidate who will be floored by Azimio candidate," he added. "Kenya Kwanza coalition is a den of political conmanship that does not recognize democracy and the will of the people. The team is an affiliation of selfish people who jeopardize justice and that was manifested through their rigging of the party primaries". He bagged the seat in 2017 through a Jubilee ticket but left for UDA. He however lost the party primaries in April to Kanar Seki. The Senator vowed to support the Azimio cause and its leaders. "I now want to say that I have joined the Azimio la Umoja coalition. I officially quit the UDA party and I will not support any leader allied to it," he said.
