A man was strong-armed by security officers after attempting to stage a protest at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi. The Tuesday drama happened during IEBC's National Election Conference at KICC. In a video seen by the star, the man was kicked out by police officers while he shouted that the current situation in ‘Sri Lanka’ would happen in Kenya. "We do not want elections in this country, we want equality, we want freedom," he said. "A Sri Lanka will happen in Kenya... We want justice and equality..." The events happened as IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati led the launch of an 18-day voter sensitization campaign, starting Tuesday. The commission has acquired 13 vehicles that will traverse the country with 4 of them starting in Nairobi County. The caravan is also expected to engage voters and answer any queries within the four cities and several towns along 13 regional roads across the country. In a similar incident last month, a man caused drama during the meeting between presidential candidates and IEBC on voter preparedness. The man identified as Julius Kamau approached Chebukati with a banner and made some demands just as Chebukati was about to invite the candidates to voice their concerns. "What I want is freedom," Kamau shouted as orderlies carried him shoulder high out of the room. Speculations have it that the man who interrupted IEBC’s meeting with Presidential aspirants at Windsor could be the same one who has caused drama today at KICC. This is, however, yet to be confirmed.
