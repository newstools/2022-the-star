A section of Mombasa vulnerable women have received grants to revive their businesses, affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. At least 50 vulnerable women received Sh500,000 entrepreneurship grant to revive their businesses. The programme is steered by the Agha Khan Foundation. Covid-19 pandemic left trails of economic destruction with businesses closing down, due to lack of income. Agha Khan Foundation programme officer Stela Maris Mumbua said the programme, which targets vulnerable women will act as a game changer. “We are targeting at least 50 community members in one of our Covid-19 interventions. We are targeting women because we know they are mostly affected and are suffering economically,” she said. Mumbua spoke during the grants disbursement last Wednesday. She said many families are still struggling to generate income leading youth to indulge in social vices like criminal activities. The project, which was rolled out at the Dream Achievers Youth organisation headquarters will be implemented across the coastal counties. The implementers of the project are targeting to initiate business start-ups with a stipend that will ensure thriving of their businesses, as part of a recovering strategy from the economic shocks of Covid-19. Vulnerable families will also get food, an initiative which will be done by Dream Achievers Youth Organisation. The organisation's executive director Saif Jira said the distribution of foodstuffs is informed by a research that identified the vulnerable. He further said there is need for coastal people to continue embracing Covid-19 protocols to avoid any further spread because different economic sectors are still recovering. “We continue emphasising that our people adhere to Covid-19 protocols, to suppress the spread of the disease,” Jira said. This comes as the department of Health continues to create awareness asking residents to adhere to Covid-19 containment measures and get vaccinated. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
