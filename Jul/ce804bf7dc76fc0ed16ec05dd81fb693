Kenya has lost its bid to host the prestigious 2025 World Athletic Championships . Instead, Tokyo will now host the global show in three years time for the second time and third in total after being chosen by World Athletics. Tokyo first hosted the championship in 1991, with Osaka hosting the second time in 2007. Kenya had hosted the the World under 17 championships in 2017 and the World Under 20 Championships last year at Moi Stadium, Kasarani   with a view to hosting the senior edition in 2025. The country was also banking on its rich athletic history from time immemorial as well as become the first African country to host the event. Kenya had three editions of the Kip Keino Classic and Cross Country Tour as part of their preparations to host the World Athletic Championships.
