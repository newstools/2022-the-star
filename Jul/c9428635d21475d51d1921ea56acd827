A 19-year-old man has been charged before a Nyeri court for threatening his mother while hurling insults at her. It is alleged that Newton Mwangi, a college student, arrived at his home in Kandara, Nyeri county while drunk in the evening of July 1 and demanded food from his mother, Esther Wangui. The court heard that an argument later ensued where Mwangi is said to have threatened his mother verbally, triggering a commotion. Principal magistrate James Macharia ordered that he be remanded as he awaits hearing of the case. Still in the same court, a man was charged for allegedly defiling a three-year-old girl. Nelson Taiti was charged with defiling the minor on June 16 at Kirurumi  in Nyeri county contrary to Sexual Offences Act No 3 of 2006. Taiti, however, denied the charges before Macharia and was released on a Sh600,000 bond with a surety of the same amount pending the mention of the case on July 21.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
