Deputy President William Ruto now claims he has gone through a lot of issues that undermine his office and personality since his fallout with president Uhuru Kenyatta. The DP while explaining a public spat between him and Uhuru said he has faced numerous challenges that ODM leader Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua would not have persevered if they were in his position.
