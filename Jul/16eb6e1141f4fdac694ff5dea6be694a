Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has slammed education CS George Magoha for what he termed as religious profiling. Magoha called out an NTV journalist who asked him a question and asked her who she was representing. "Where are you from, and who are you representing? If it's Al-Shabaab I will not answer you," Magoha said. Duale in a statement said Magoha was not respecting the leadership and Integrity Act. It spells out responsibilities and guiding principles of leadership which include respect for people and discipline. "To imagine our beloved children who you are responsible for hearing you say those words is Unacceptable! Shame on you! Again, "Duale said. Duale asked the CS to apologize, or the President should sack him. The lawmaker went ahead to term the CS as reckless and biased for profiling the female journalist. Duale questioned Magoha's conduct in this case which has raised concern even in the Muslim community. "Is it wrong for a female journalist to ask CS questions? Is it wrong if the female journalist is Somali, or because she is Muslim?" Duale said. He went ahead and faulted the other leaders who were behind Magoha during the press conference. In the clip, the officials are seen laughing after Magoha made the remarks about the journalist. "What is even more horrifying is how other public officers standing next to the cabinet secretary are laughing their hearts out at the stale joke and unfortunate, display of bloated backwardness by the CS," Duale added. This comes after Muslim clerics also called for Magoha to be sacked during a press conference today. Muslim leaders led by Supkem chairman Hassan Ole Naado and Namlef’s Yusuf Murigu on Tuesday said the comments by the CS were in bad taste and that they amounted to religious and ethnic profiling.
