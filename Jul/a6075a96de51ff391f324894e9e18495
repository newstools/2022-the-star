Your liver is an essential organ in your body, and to remain healthy it is important to keep it in good shape. However, for all this to happen, it is important to look for ways to keep them free of wastes and toxins. There is no need to buy expensive supplements, because the liver acts  as the body's own detox system. All you need to do is maintain a fruit and vegetable rich diet, drink enough water and limit your alcohol intake. Here is a smoothie you can try. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Add all the ingredients to a high-speed blender and blend everything together.

If you have been diagnosed with a liver or kidney condition, talk to your doctor about any special dietary changes.
