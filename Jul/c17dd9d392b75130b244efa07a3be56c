Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto will on Sunday take his campaigns to Narok, Kericho and Kisii counties. His itinerary will start at Kilgoris in Kilgoris Constituency before proceeding to Kapkatet, Bureti Constituency, and end his campaigns at Kisii town. Ruto had on Saturday taken his campaigns to Kajiado and Narok counties. He was accompanied by his running mate Rigathi Gachagua, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula, among others. Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will on the other hand be campaigning in Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Laikipia and the last stop will be Nyandarua. He will be accompanied by leaders allied to the coalition to drum up support for their bid. He had on Saturday taken his campaigns to Murang'a county. The 2022 general election has been touted as the most competitive with a lot at stake for the two leading presidential contenders. Raila is making his fifth, and probably, the last attempt at becoming Kenya’s commander-in-chief while the DP is on his maiden attempt to occupy State House, failure to which he will be secluded in the opposition at least for the next five years.
