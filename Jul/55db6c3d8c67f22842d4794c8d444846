The actress played scientist Jane Foster, the love interest of Chris Hemsworth's Thor, in 2011's Thor and 2013's Thor: The Dark World. Natalie skipped Taika Waititi's 2017 flick Thor: Ragnarok but is returning for the director's follow-up, marking the fourth instalment in the franchise. In an interview for Vogue Australia, she admitted that she was a little nervous about reprising her role in the franchise. "It was incredible to get to come back, and also kind of surreal,"she said.
