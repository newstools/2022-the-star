IEBC in Bungoma has trained 50 police officers in preparation for next month's election. Bungoma county IEBC returning officer Grace Rono said the commission trained police officers who will take part in the polling process. She spoke to the Star at the county commissioner’s office on Tuesday. “Police officers are part and parcel of the polling process in Kenya and that is why the commission has trained them so they can cope with the voters and the IEBC officials,” Rono said. She said the information will be cascaded down to other police officers who did not have the chance to attend the training. Rono said the commission is prepared to deliver free, fair and credible elections and all election laws will be adhered to. She said no complaints have so far been registered at the IEBC offices in Bungoma county. Rono urged voters in Bungoma to turn up in huge numbers, cast their votes, return home and follow the process on TV and radio. “Election is only a one-day exercise, so let us maintain peace and pick the leaders we want. Kenya must continue after polls,” she said. Bungoma county police commander Francis Kooli told the Star he will ensure all police officers in Bungoma county comply with section 105 of the Election Act. Police officers are required to collaborate with the IEBC on the provision of security. Kooli said everything is in order to ensure the election is done in an organised and peaceful environment. He urged Bungoma residents to keep peace before, during and after elections.
