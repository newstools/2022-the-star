Reigning women champions Nairobi Water Queens confront National Cereals and Produce Board in a Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league cracker at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. Veteran Water tactician Jack Ochieng said he is going all out for a win although he has great respect for his opponents, who made some key signings. “I know them well. We have played many friendly matches against each other and I have always had the edge. This will be no different,” said Ochieng. “My offence is sharp. I have been working on the defence to make it watertight. This will be the key to winning this game.” The Water side boast of a deadly national team trio of captain Gladys Chilo, Brenda Arivida and Brenda Musambai. NCPB tactician Dan Eshikumo notes: “We have changed our tactics a bit and we believe we can upset them this time around.” “The response in training is good and the players have adapted well. We are ready.” The other women’s matches of the day will see Net Neighbours debut against Amazon and Nairobi City County (NCC). Annette Baraza’s Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) will be gunning for maximum points as they have a date with New Hope. The man’s match-ups of the day will see Thika meet Jkuat as Boomerang come face-to-face with GSU. Winless Young City coach Francis Omole is convinced they are moving in the right direction as they prepare to face Buccaneers on Sunday. The Technical University of Kenya play Thika, Boomerang meet NCC while Ulinzi confront Buccaneers. Last year’s women runners-up, Ulinzi Sharks have a date with Net Neighbours as Jkuat close the women’s show against Amazon.
