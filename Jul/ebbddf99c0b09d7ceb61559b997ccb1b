Police in Kirua and Kibirichia areas in Buuri, Meru are hunting for a man suspected to have killed his wife at Karanene village, Kiamiego sub-location. Senior chief Anderson Mwirigi confirmed that the suspect, Patrick Mwirigi hacked his wife and went into hiding after a domestic violence. Mwirigi said the suspect is dangerous and is armed with C-line and knives making residents afraid to apprehend him when he appeared once in a nearby market. “We appeal to residents to avail crucial information to area manager, assistant chief and once they spot the suspect for the law can take its course," Mwirigi said. "We believe he killed his wife because he did not report her death to the police. They had children together. "I was informed that he was last seen at Kibirichia market heavily intoxicated." Mwirigi said the only way to eliminate such crimes from the community is ensure nobody harbours suspects. He urged families to endear and love each other and seek to resolve any disputes amicably. “To the families who have made violence their tea break, lunch and supper please talk together and find a solution because worldly things last only for a time. There is no permanent suffering or problem,” Mwirigi said. Acting director of Gender-based violence at the department of Gender, Halima Abdi, raised concern about the high number of GBV cases in the county. “Statistics from the national GBV hotline 1195 shows that between January and March 2022, Meru was number 13 among counties with the highest cases,” she said. Abdi said everyone should play their role to eradicate GBV  by 2026. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
