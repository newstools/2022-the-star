Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga has settled for Kasarani Stadium as the venue for the Coalition's final rally on August 6. "We will head to Nairobi, to a place called Kasarani. On date 6th, we will close our campaigns," he said. Speaking on Tuesday during a campaign meeting in Kianjai, Raila said Meru County marks the beginning of the final campaign, 13 days to the general elections. "Today, here in Meru we have now started the count down. From here, tomorrow we will go to Nyeri, then on Thursday to Nakuru, on Friday we will go to Machakos," he said. "Then we will head to Suswa, we will the go back to Eldoret and from there to Kiambu, then to Kisii, Kakamega, Kisumu and Mombasa." The ODM leader further said on August 7, the Coalition will hold an election prayer day. "On August 8, we will prepare for the voting day," he added. Raila said he is ready to show his opponent William Ruto that he is not scared, on August 9, contrary to the DP's claims. He exuded confidence in that he will be the next president of Kenya. "He has been saying Baba is afraid that is why he is not coming to the debate. I cannot go and debate with a thief and a liar, who lies on a daily basis," Raila claimed. He lashed out at Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza camp for claiming that Azimio was weaponising the war against corruption. The former Prime Minister affirmed that he is ready to face Ruto at the ballot, adding that it matters most compared to the debate.
