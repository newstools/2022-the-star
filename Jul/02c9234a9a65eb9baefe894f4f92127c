Protect the Senate so that it can ensure devolution works in the country, deputy Senate Speaker Margaret Kamar has said. Kamar said devolution was only 10 years and had made good strides in terms of development. "Devolution is what is going to change the face of this country. It's only 10 years and we have seen a lot of changes take place," she said. She addressed the Senate staff during an exit retreat between the Senate leadership and employees. The Uasin Gishu senator also wished her colleagues seeking reelection best of luck, noting that she will not be defending her seat. "You are going to have new members coming in and I want to encourage you to help them both as a Senate and as an individual," she said. Kamar also urged those senators currently vying for the gubernatorial positions in various counties to ensure they address the shortcomings of the current governors, if elected. The Senate Majority Leader Samuel Phogisio, however, said the House has the potential to deliver devolution, but still lacks some key instruments. Phogiso said there was need for some amendments to be done to strengthen the work of the Senate. "There are certain amendments that should be made. Some of them will be constitutional, some of them will be amending laws in our relationship with the other House, [like] changes Standing Orders," he said. Phogiso, who is set to defend his seat as the West Pokot senator, said the fourth Senate must work extra hard to put in place the necessary instruments needed to fully function. Senator Fred Outa, who played host, said as the outgoing senators, they strived to make laws that can protect counties in terms of resource allocation. Outa said the meeting will help examine the strengths and weaknesses of the current Senate and come up with modalities on how best to improve.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
