The government through Lake Victoria North Water Works Development Agency has started drilling a borehole at Ileho Secondary School to provide water to residents. The Sh8 million project in Kakamega is expected to be completed by December 9 this year. It will be implemented in two phases. It will serve Ileho primary and secondary schools, and Ileho polytechnic. In addition, the water agency will construct four communal water points to enable residents from surrounding villages to access water. The project works include installation of a 30-metre cubic elevated structurally pressed steel tank on an eight-metre elevated steel tower to enable easy flow of water. LVNWWDA will also instal a submersible pump set to connect the water point to both solar power and the national grid. Phase two of the project is expected to increase the area of coverage. The project is expected to serve more than 1,000 people in the locality. Isukha East MCA Samuel Peter Imbwakali urged residents to efficiently utilise the water once the project is complete. He said in the first phase, the contractor will connect the water to Ileho primary, secondary and the nearby Ileho Polytechnic. Phase two of the project will benefit residents. “We want our people to access water since water is life,” Imbwakali said. Resident George Muruli urged community members to take advantage of the water project to grow crops through irrigation.
