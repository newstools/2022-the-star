Police in Voi, Taita Taveta County have confiscated 4,980 rolls of bhang valued at Sh4.5 million. County police commander Patrick Okeri said the drugs were packed in six 90-kilogram sacks and were nabbed along the Voi/Mwatate road. One suspect who is believed to have been ferrying the bhang from Nairobi escaped during the Sunday evening raid. Acting on a tip-off from a member of the public, Okeri said police intercepted the vehicle at Voi junction but the driver of the vehicle drove off towards Mombasa. “We called Maungu police who laid a roadblock to arrest him. However, on reaching the roadblock, he made a U-turn and sped off towards Voi and later diverted to Mwatate,” Okeri told journalists at the station on Monday. On realizing that he was being pursued by police, the suspect parked the vehicle at a homestead along the Voi/Mwatate road and escaped. Police have launched a manhunt to arrest him. He said the suspect was destined for the coastal towns where he was planning to sell the drugs. A five-seater Ipsum car which was ferrying the bhang was also confiscated. “The chase number and the engine number do not match. We are working with the NTSA to know the owner of the vehicle,” Okeri said. Okeri warned that growing, selling and consuming marijuana remains illegal and that those involved in the illegal business will be prosecuted. The police boss further asked members of the public to closely work with the police in the fight against drugs. The region is a notorious transit hot spot for drugs especially bhang which is alleged to be transported along the Nairobi/Mombasa highway. Voi/Taveta/Hollili road is also listed among transit hot spots for drugs imported from Tanzania through the porous Taveta border point.
