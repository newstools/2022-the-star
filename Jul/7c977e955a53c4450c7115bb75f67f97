Singer Nandy and Billnass are set to walk down the aisle on Saturday. Ahead of their wedding, Billnass has confirmed he has another child outside his relationship with Nandy, who is pregnant with his child. "For now, let's focus on my wedding, but the baby is there and they are okay," he said. "They turned a year old and so we shall be talking more about that in the near future." In April, the rapper said he was not sure if he already has a child out of wedlock. He was respondign to the question on who's child he keeps posting on social media. "I'm not sure. I am not sure whether I have a child or not." Last year, the couple lost another baby through miscarriage.
