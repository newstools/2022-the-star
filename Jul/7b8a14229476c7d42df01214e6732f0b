President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday defended his endorsement of Raila Odinga as his preferred successor saying old age is not a disease. In a thinly veiled attack that appeared directed at Deputy President William Ruto, Uhuru said no one was looking for a leader to run a marathon. “Uzee sio ugonjwa…hamtafuti mtu ati aende akimbie marathon. Kuna Kipchoge, Kipchoge atakimbia mbio. Tunatafuta mtu ako na fikra, ako na hekima, ako na unyenyekevu, anapenda watu yake na ako na ujuzi wa kusema wacha tukae pamoja tutembee pamoja. (Old age is not a disease. You are not looking for someone to run the marathon, we have (Eliud) Kipchoge he will go run. We are looking for a someone with vision, wisdom, humble, loves his people and has an inkling for togetherness) Uhuru spoke while commissioning the Sh1 billion Naivasha Industrial Park Water Project in Suswa, Narok County. The project implemented by Rift Valley Water Works Development Agency was designed to provide adequate clean water for use at the ICD as well as reticulation and waste water systems. While stating that he wasn't campaigning for anyone, Uhuru asked the crowd present at the event to vote for Raila. On March 12, 2022, Uhuru endorsed the Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate for the presidency. "Mimi sijataja mtu, mimi sifanyi campaign...mimi sijasema chochote, nasema tu kuna mzee ambaye...(hand gesture)." (I have not mentioned anyone. I'm not campaigning, I have just said there is an old man) "Sijui kama mtamuunga mkono jameni. Mtamuunga mkono? Uhuru asked the crowd to a roaring response. (I don't know if you will support him. Will you support him?) Ruto and his allies have been taunting Raila as a state project who the system wants to impose on Kenyans. The DP has rallied his supporters to reject the ODM leader saying he has nothing to offer them.
