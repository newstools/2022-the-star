ODM leader Raila Odinga has asked Kenyans to pray for the safety of all leaders as they intensify campaign ahead of the August 9, polls. In a statement after an aircraft carrying his allies landed in a ditch, Raila said he was not onboard. "We thank God the Almighty that nobody was injured in an aircraft that was carrying members of our team that had a mishap at the Kakuma Airstrip. I wasn't onboard the said aircraft myself," he said. "Let us continue praying for the safety of all leaders as we continue with the campaigns." Confirming the incident, Richard Morara Turkana West Police Sub County Commander said the plane developed a minor problem before taking off on a runway at Kakuma airstrip. "The plane had a minor problem, the back tire had a puncture. Just after the pilot was taking off, he realised the tyre had a problem and he had to land immediately just after taking off,"  Morara said. He said no casualties were reported. ODM communication Director Philip Etale said the plane was carrying the secretariat team who were dispatched to organise the event. He said the plane had seven staff including security officers.
