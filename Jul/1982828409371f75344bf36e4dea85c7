It is upon Deputy President William Ruto and his running mate Rigathi Gachagua to decide whether they will attend the debates, his campaign secretariat has said. Presidential campaign director of communication Hussein Mohammed made the revelations on Friday. “Whether or not the candidate (Ruto) and the running mate will appear is a matter that firmly rests with them,” he said. The presidential debate is scheduled for July 26 while that of the running mates has been set for July 19. The official addressed the press on Friday during the unveiling of a new William Ruto Presidential campaign centre. Present during the event were UDA’s secretary General Veronica Maina, Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua, Uasin Gishu woman representative Gladys Shollei and Ababu Namwamba. The centre houses technical teams that Nanok stated help in generating the daily plans and planning logistics for Ruto’s campaigns. It also houses county coordinators from the 47 counties and legal and economic teams.
