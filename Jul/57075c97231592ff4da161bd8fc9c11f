Former Kajiado Governor David Nkedianye on Thursday appealed to the national government to buy pastoralists' livestock that are at risk of dying due to drought. He said the drought has taken a toll on cattle and if nothing is done now, the animals will start dying at the close of July. “We expect the short rains at the end of October, and already cows have become emaciated. The Kenya Meat Commission can buy the animals through their off-take programme now before they start dying,” Nkedianye said. The former governor was speaking in Kenyawa/Poka ward during his gubernatorial campaign. He said the government must be sensitive to the drought situation in Kajiado. Nkedianye said owing to the high cost of living, pastoralists in the county are unable to sell their livestock in the local markets. The government, through the KMC, buys livestock in its off-take programme to cushion farmers and pastoralists against severe drought in arid and semi-arid areas of the country. “As we speak, most farmers have moved their cows to Mosiro, Magadi, Iloodokilani wards in Kajiado West and some have even crossed over to Narok county in search of grass,” Nkedianye said. He was accompanied by former Kajiado West MP Moses Sakuda, who is seeking the county Senate seat and Marina Kelly, who is vying for Kajiado East parliamentary seat. Nkedianye urged Governor Joseph Lenku to release funds for the purchase of diesel for borehole pumping machines in all the subcounties. “We are also urging the county government to reintroduce the school feeding programme during this time of drought. Some children have stopped going to school because of the economic situation in the country,” he said. Edited by A.N
