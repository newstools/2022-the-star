The bitter war of words between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his estranged deputy, William Ruto, is escalating by the day. Uhuru uses any available public forum to hit at his deputy and Ruto, not one to take such attacks lying down, answers almost immediately. Both enjoy a wide following of fanatical supporters who can literally put their lives on the cross for them. Such utterances and heightened exchanges go a long way in charging this group. All leaders — not just Uhuru and Ruto — should ease the rising tension between supporters of their parties ahead of the August 9 elections. When will Kenya ever witness an issue-based campaign, devoid of name calling, ethnic profiling and false accusations all aimed at whipping up emotions? The rising political temperature is not good for an already buttered economy. Most investors are taking a wait and see attitude at a time when the economy needs a booster jab to resuscitate it from the Covid-19 blow. Economic activities must not slow down every election because of the recklessness and war mongering by those seeking public office. With 35 days to the elections, our leaders can steer the country from a path of anger, vitriol and incitement to an issue-based campaign that is not divisive.
