Okutoyi said she hopes to adapt accordingly to the hard court surface having played on grass for the past month in tournaments in Northampton and Wimbledon. “ It won't be a problem because, for the better part of the year, I played on the hard court so adjusting will not be a problem,” noted Okutoyi The African junior champion believes she has the momentum from winning at Wimbledon and believes things will work out perfectly. “Confidence-wise, it is a big boost and I am relishing the challenge of playing in Tunisia and Egypt before heading to the US," she revealed.
