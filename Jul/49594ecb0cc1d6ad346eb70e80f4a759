Lawyer Miguna Miguna has lashed out at Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja over the push and pull surrounding his degree. The lawyer took to Twitter on Friday questioning why Sakaja was blaming his unfinished UoN degree on poverty. "I'm sick and tired of Sakaja's lies. He had publicly stated how he became a millionaire businessman with a Mercedes Benz vehicle while at the UoN. How he grew up in Atwoli's (COTU boss) household," he tweeted. "He said he had a Degree in Actuarial Science. Why is he now wailing about poverty?" Miguna asked. In the past, Sakaja has claimed that he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from the UoN, but the university denied the claims. They said that even though the Senator was a student at the campus, he never finished his studies. In 2021, talking to Churchill Show's host Daniel Ndambuki, Sakaja revealed that he bought his first car, a Mercedes Benz, while in university. He said it cost him Sh500,000. Sakaja also revealed that he used to run several businesses so as to pay his school fees and sometimes would participate in the late President Mwai Kibaki's campaigns to get money. "I used to cook and wash people's clothes. But at the end of the day, I had around Sh5,000," he said. On Friday, the governor candidate came out and accepted that he still has several units he could not take due to lack of fees. "There is a document being shared that shows it was the issue of fees. There were a few units I did not complete but the ceremony of graduation is not what confers the knowledge to you." He however said he had a plan to go back and finish his studies. Sakaja is under fire regarding his higher level of education credentials.
