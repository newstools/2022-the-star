Calvin Bassey has completed his move from Rangers to Ajax for an Ibrox club record fee of close to £20m. The Nigeria defender, 22, has signed a five-year-deal with the Dutch champions, while add-ons could boost the deal by another £3m. Bassey joined Rangers from Leicester City for a modest compensation fee in 2020 and emerged as a key player last season. Rangers’ previous highest sale was £11.5m for Nathan Patterson. Bassey made 15 appearances as Rangers won their first top flight title in a decade during his debut campaign. Last term, he racked up 50 games as the Ibrox club reached the Europa League final and won the Scottish Cup. Scotland centre-half John Souttar agreed a pre-contract move to Rangers from Hearts earlier in the year, while the Ibrox club signed defender Ben Davies from Liverpool on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace have agreed a fee of £8.5m plus £2.5m in add-ons for Bayern Munich defender Chris Richards. The 22-year-old American international spent last season on loan at Bundesliga side Hoffenheim. He has been pushed further down the pecking order at Bayern by the arrival of Matthijs de Ligt from Juventus. Richards joined Bayern Munich on loan from FC Dallas in 2018 before the deal was made permanent in January 2019. The defender, who can play in multiple positions, has made five first-team appearances for Bayern, 30 Bundesliga appearances at Hoffenheim and eight for the USA national team. He would become Patrick Vieira’s fourth signing of the summer after Sam Johnstone, Malcolm Ebiowei and Cheick Doucoure.
