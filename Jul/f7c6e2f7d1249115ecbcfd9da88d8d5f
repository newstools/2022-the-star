Roots Party presidential candidate George Wajackoya wants to promote Nyasore primary in Nyamira into a university if elected. Nyasore is a Gusii word that means bhang. Excited by its identity during his tour of Kisii and Nyamira on Monday, Wajakoyah said the new 'Nyasore University' will be the first higher institution of learning that would offer studies on ' bhang.' "Am here today to urge you to back my bid. The Bhang agenda, if implemented is going to spur the country into greater economic heights," he said. Wajackoyah arrived in Kisii Sunday before he headed out to Kenyenya in Bomachoge Borabu for rallies Monday morning and Nyamira. Later in the day, he addressed hundreds of enthusiastic fans at Capital Round About in central Kisii town. Wajackoyah's key agenda is about bringing economic and social salvation to the country through bhang cultivation and export. He promises to suspend the right to life for graft suspects. He would further reduce official working days to four, increase maternity leave for women to one year and, introduce eight prime ministers. He would relocate the capital city from Nairobi to Isiolo if he trounces Raila Odinga (ODM) and William Ruto (UDA). In Kisii, Wajackoya told the residents that that region stands to benefit immensely from the bhang farming and thus the need to vote for him. "This will be a reality if you elect me," said the Roots Presidential candidate. The two-day tours took him to various parts of Kisii Nyamira. Not a few turned up to give him a heroic welcome. A single haul of bhang for export from Kisii would significantly address the economic debts of the country, he said.
