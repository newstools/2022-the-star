Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa has issued title deeds to Bungoma residents in nine subcounties. He said since 2013, the government has issued more than six million title deeds. “We are happy that several people from Bungoma who have lived for more than 60 years without the title deeds have received them,” he said. “Bungoma has processed 69,000 title deeds since 2013.” Many families in Bungoma had raised issues concerning land title deeds, and succession and several cases have been raised. Bungoma county commissioner Samuel Kimiti said he has received several cases from the residents concerning land issues. “Out of every five cases, three of them concern land and this shows that land issues are unending,” Kimiti said. He said most domestic violence cases are a result of land issues. Kimiti said three to four generations lacked land title deeds and there was a need for civic education on land succession after the issuance of title deeds to enable them to understand the importance. He urged the residents to use governemnt or private surveyors registered under the government saying people should pass through the Land Control Board to show land transactions. Kimiti said transactions done under Special Land Control Board are illegal unless there is a written letter to the county commissioner, which concerns special family issues. He said chiefs should not be part of any land agreement issues. Eugene urged the residents to maintain and promote peace as the country prepares for the general election. This, he said, was the most crucial part of the development of a nation.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
