The Communications Authority (CA) of Kenya has directed Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to ensure the use of licensed ICT platforms for betting is done to duly licensed firms. CA Director General Ezra Chiloba on Saturday further ordered the Operators to immediately discontinue the issuance of licensed ICT platforms and services to gaming and betting firms that are yet to be licensed. This includes USSDs, Shortcodes and PayBill numbers. "Additionally, the MNOs shall be required to provide returns to the BCLB and the Authority detailing numbering resources (PayBill and USSDs), allocated to licensed betting and gambling services providers on a monthly basis," Chiloba said. He added that the directives given to the MNOs are in line with the relevant licensing conditions on the provision of the license services. Chiloba urged the Operators to carry on any further consultations with the BCLB chairperson, Cyrus Maina. The CA acknowledged that the Betting Control and Licensing Board is currently undertaking the license renewal to the firm. The BCLB is, however, only allowing renewals for firms meeting the requirements set by the Interior CS Fred Matiang'i. They include; clearance by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), the Financial Reporting Centre, CA and the Interagency security team before being licensed to operate. On Thursday, the Board reported that the majority of the betting, gaming and lottery firms have not met the aforementioned list.
