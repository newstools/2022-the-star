The two teachers of Nyamninia primary school who were arrested over the alleged assault of pupils were not arraigned in court on Monday as expected. A source at the criminal's investigations department at Yala Police Station, who is not authorized to speak to the media, said that Paul Osogo and Morine Otieno were on Friday released on a bond of Sh20,000 each. The same source indicated that the two will be presented in court for plea taking before the end of this week as their files are still being processed. Speaking at Wagwer Secondary School on Saturday, Education CS George Magoha said that the two teachers should be sacked over cruelty.
