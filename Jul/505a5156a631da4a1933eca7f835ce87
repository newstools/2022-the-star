Former Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has filed an application before the East African Court of Justice seeking to suspend implementation of the Supreme Court decision that upheld his impeachment. He says the decision of the Supreme Court and courts of Kenya was arrived at in an unjust manner. Its effect, Sonko says, is to curtail his political rights and the people he represents. "The decision of the Kenyan judicial arm is tainted with illegality as the decision of the high court as upheld by the Supreme Court was influenced through corrupt means," he says. Sonko says the Presiding Judge at the High court who rendered the decision is currently facing a disciplinary tribunal over his removal as a result of receiving bribes and influencing the decision that resulted in his removal from office. He wants the EAC court to suspend the execution of the decision by the Apex court pending a hearing and determination of the application. At the same time, Sonko has asked the Supreme Court to review its decision that upheld his impeachment. He wants the apex court to set aside its decision on grounds that Justice Chitembwe, who was part of the bench that upheld his impeachment, is expected to be investigated over misconduct allegations. Part of the complaint before the tribunal, he says, is that Chitembwe was biased and mischievous in the manner in which he handled his impeachment case. "The determination of the proceedings before the tribunal will have a bearing on the challenged judgment of the high court culminating in this appeal," Sonko said. Sonko says it's only fair if the Supreme court judgement is reviewed or set aside and heard under the circumstance that the conduct of Chitembwe would be considered.
