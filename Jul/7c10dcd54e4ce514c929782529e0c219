National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said Kirinyaga Woman rep Wangui Ngirici is unfit to hold governor’s job in Kirinyaga County. Muturi alledged the county MP underperformed as a Woman Rep and wondered how she can handle the county top job. But in a quick fightback, Ngirici asked the Speaker to declare whether he had joined competition between two women in the county’s governor race. Ngirici, in her social media pages Sunday, told off the Speaker for insinuating that she had underperformed in Parliament. “Hon Muturi must know that speaking in base in a political rally carries some weight and resonates well with the people. Let your voice not confuse you to join a competition between two women,” she said. Ngirici was responding to Muturi’s remarks in the company of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru on Saturday where he dismissed the Woman MP’s capacity to run the county. The Speaker claimed that the MP’s performance in Parliament was dismal hence was unfit to hold the Kirinyaga governor seat. "Mimi kama prefect wa hawa wabunge sikuona huyu anaongea. Hakuifanya kazi yeyote huko bunge. Hata mkimchagua awe governor ni kulala tu (As their prefect in Parliament, she did not do much. Even if you elect her as governor, all she’ll do is sleep),” Muturi said. Speaking at Kiamutugu Centre in Gichugu Constituency during a Kenya Kwanza rally, the Speaker advised the residents to vote for competent leaders with capacity to uplift their living standards. Embu governor candidate Cecily Mbarire also joined Muturi to drum up support for Governor Waiguru who is facing off with Ngirici and Senator Charles Kibiru to retain her job. Ngirici is hailed as one of the frontrunners in the race albeit amid observations that her bid as well as that of Kibiru could give Waiguru an upper hand. Owing to this, the Kenya Kwanza team exuded the confidence that they would secure victory for both Waiguru and DP William Ruto in the country.
