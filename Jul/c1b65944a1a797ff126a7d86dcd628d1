Strathmore University coach Peter Mwathi has sharpened his offence and is eyeing maximum points in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league match against Rangers. The students, who nipped Buccaneers 20-18 in their last week's encounter, face the Rangers at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday in what should be a tricky game. "Rangers are equally a good team and we must take the match with the seriousness it deserves," warned Mwathi. Strathmore have won their opening five matches but the last two have been with very close margins. However, Mwathi is convinced the scoring will improve. "These were tough matches but we are aware there shall be no easy matches, especially those involving the top 10 in last season." "The other factor in my team is that I have not fielded the regulars. I have brought in five new players that have never featured in the league and are really picking up very well." Rangers also have a date with the visiting Makueni Bees who showed their mettle in a close 34-31 loss to Buccaneers. The Makueni students will also play win-less Young City in a game that should see them post their first victory. The women's matchups of the day will see last year's runners-up Ulinzi Sharks come face to face against Nairobi City County (NCC). Rampant women's league champions Nairobi Water Queens should extend their unbeaten run with a match against Rangers. In Sunday's matches, Young City will take on Rangers, Technical University of Kenya (TUK) meet Black Mamba while Buccaneers tackle Thika. Reigning men's champions National Cereals and Produce Board take on Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
