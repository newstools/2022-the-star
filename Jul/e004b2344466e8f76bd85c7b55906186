Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu on Wednesday lashed out at Deputy President William Ruto over condescending remarks he made on Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa. The DP on Tuesday fired back at CS Wamalwa who had accused him of almost slapping him. In a rejoinder, the DP said: "In our community, we do not slap women, we respect them". Speaking during an Azimio campaign on Wednesday in Kinango, Kwale County, Ngilu poked holes into the remarks accusing the DP of disrespecting women. Ngilu said Ruto was bitter over the looming defeat in the August 9 polls even as he questioned how he concluded Eugine was a woman. "Ako na hasira... Kila asubuhi akiamka, ni matusi. Ikiwa hatusi CS Wamalwa, anatusi kina mama (He is angry... Every morning he wakes up, its insults. If he is not insulting CS Wamalwa, he is insulting women)," she said. "I just want to know when he says a man is like a woman, how did he know that? Did he go to his house and request to see how he is? What kind of a man is he? Why is he insulting women?" Ngilu urged the UDA leader to stop insulting women and told him if he is defeated, he should go home without delay. "He should start packing. He should also stop insulting women and showing us his anger." Ngilu pointed out that her presidential candidate Raila Odinga has respected women, and showed them that, by appointing Martha Karua as his running mate.
