Zetech University Sparks coach Maurice Obilo is hoping to make the cut to the playoff finals this year. A confident Obilo said his charges made a statement by dismantling former champions Equity Bank Hawks 64-47 over the weekend. "Our focus this year is to be in the top three in the regular season and make it to the finals," offered Obilo. This was the students' fifth win in a row in the ongoing Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) and they remain hungry for more success. The high-riding Sparks, who lost to the bankers five times last year including 3-0 in the semi-finals, series have now matured. "The girls are playing together in their second season and they have matured. They had lapses last year because they were young," he said. The team's new acquisition guard Ashley Minayo joined the team from Storms and has improved Sparks' backcourt play. "She is a very good addition and her arrival has made a huge impact on the team," Obilo noted. Minayo, who dropped 10 points against the Hawks, has formed a lethal combination with Christine Akinyi and Chantal, Kyobe who combined for a 32-point haul. "Last year, we were better against all our opponents in all areas except at the free throw line. We have worked on it, and the results are there for all to see." He said besides former champions Equity Bank, Zetech have beaten  Strathmore, Storms, Lady Bucks and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. Sparks are second on the 12-team log with 10 points from five games.  Kenya Ports Authority are top with the same points on better aggregate while Equity are third on 8.
