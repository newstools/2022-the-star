Bomet Governor Prof Hillary Barchok on Monday oversaw the delivery of a Sh15 million medical consignment Longisa Referral Hospital. The delivery from the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa) follows another Sh45 million supply in February when a group of residents have complained of a shortage of medicine in public health facilities. Prof Barchok, who is also the UDA nominee for governor, denied claims of shortage. He said that narrative originated from his opponents to his bid for reelection. He said the pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical supplies were expected to be distributed to all public health facilities in Bomet by close of business on Wednesday. the supply will last until October, he said. He said the County Government of Bomet relied on sharable revenue from the national Government and that delays in dispatching the funds have often led to delay in supplying health facilities. The Governor reiterated that none of the residents of Bomet have gone without basic treatment in any public health facility. He said the health of the people of Bomet remained paramount and should not be politicised. (Edited by V. Graham)
