A man has been arrested for allegedly destroying fiber infrastructure along Nairobi Expressway. The suspect was apprehended on Wednesday evening by government officials before being handed over to the police. "The ministry of ICT will continue protecting the ICT infrastructure it is implementing on behalf of government for the citizen," The ministry said in a tweet. The Sh72 billion project is a public-private partnership funded, with no debt incurred by the government. China Communications Construction Company, the parent firm of China Road and Bridge Corporation, is funding and built the highway. The expressway will cut travel time from Rironi to JKIA from three hours to just 20 minutes.
