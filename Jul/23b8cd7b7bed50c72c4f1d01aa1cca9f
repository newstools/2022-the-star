Song and dance rent the air as Wimbledon junior doubles champion Angela Okutoyi landed in the country on Monday evening . Okutoyi, who is also the Africa Junior champion, was received by Sports Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohammed and National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) secretary-general, Francis Mutuku alongside several members of the tennis fraternity. Players and coaches were also present amid carnival atmosphere which brought terminal 1A at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to a standstill. Fans started streaming in as early as 8pm to catch a glimpse of the Kenya's newest history maker, who displayed the  trophy she won alongside Rose Nijkamp of Netherlands at the All England Club. A delighted Okutoyi thanked Kenyans for their support and prayers while at Wimbledon. "I was really determined to do the country proud and show the world we are not only an athletics nation but we also have great tennis players," she said. Okutoyi thanked Tennis Kenya and the Ministry of Sports for their support. "I would like to thank the Sports CS for the support and I am delighted with the help I received from Tennis Kenya too," she noted. Okutoyi's next big tournament will be the US Open, where she will be seeking to continue her rich vein of form and do well in the doubles category.
