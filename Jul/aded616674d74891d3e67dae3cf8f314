Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto will, on Thursday, take his campaigns to Narok, Migori, Nyamira and Kisii counties. His itinerary will start at Angata Barrikoi in Kilgoris constituency before flying to Mabera in Kuria West constituency. From Kuria, the DP will go to Nyamira Town in West Mugirango, then proceed to Marani in Kitutu Chache North. The trail will then head to Mariwa Moticho in South Mugirango constituency and end at Ilmotiok in Narok West. On Wednesday, Ruto took his campaigns to Kakamega and Vihiga,  counties. His running mate Rigathi Gachagua took the Kenya Kwanza gospel to Meru county. His rally, however, was cut short after chaos erupted. Gachagua, who has pitched tents in the county since Monday, was forced to end his campaigns in Mutuati and Igembe North after rival groups clashed and started throwing stones at each other. Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will, on the other hand, continue with his campaign at the coast counties to drum up support for his bid. Raila and his running mate Martha Karua will hold a campaign blitz that will take them through Mombasa and Kilifi counties until Friday.
