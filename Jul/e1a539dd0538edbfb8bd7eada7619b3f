Giant social media app Twitter on Thursday experienced a technical hitch tha resulted in users being unable to access services for about an hour. The technical issue was first reported by Down Detector. The error was affecting both iPhone and Android as well as those using computers. Users unable to access the platform began reporting the issue from 3pm. Many were receiving ‘something went wrong’ messages, prompting users to try and reload the app but to no avail. The most affected feature is the inability to load the timeline or tweet. In less than an hour, the application was back up and running. A few complaints are still being raised about lagging and slow loading of tweets. Twitter is yet to confirm and give reasons for the outage.
