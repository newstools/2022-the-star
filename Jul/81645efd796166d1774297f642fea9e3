Google has announced that it will roll out a new look for its Gmail interface to all users. Google has been working on the new look since February and now, they have announced that the changes pull together elements from Google’s material design 3, Meet, Chat, and spaces, giving a whole experience under one screen. However, Google has said those who do not like the new design have an option to change back to the older version in the settings. Click settings in the top right corner. Then under Quick Settings, click Go back to the original Gmail view. Then in the new window, click Reload. The new changes are a part of Google’s overall new approach to the Workspace suite (including Docs, Sheets, etc.) that is supposed to provide a more unified style and new AI-powered features. The new updated system will be available globally to all users. It also announced that it is updating its search tweaks to ensure that you are emailing the right person. This will improve its search results, which should make it easier to find a specific contact.
