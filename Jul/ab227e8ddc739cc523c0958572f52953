Rapper King Kaka and his wife Nana Owiti fully paid for upcoming rapper Kanambo Dede's school fees and everything she required to go back to school. Kanambo, who went viral after rapping in the streets, said she had dropped out of school due to poverty and early pregnancy. Speaking to Word Is, Nana said Kaka Empire will help Kanambo achieve her dreams. "We are just mentoring the girl and giving her another chance at life because it’s not about how we start a race, it’s about how we finish," she said. Kanambo said in a past interview that it was her wish to finish school and pursue her dreams. "Since I moved out of Kayole, I felt I needed to go back to school and lay a foundation for my dreams since I feel I messed up in the past." The young rapper encouraged students who are in school to take their studies serious. She added that she will do her best to balance schoolwork and her music career. Kanambo recorded her first single in January at Kaka Empire. King Kaka reached out to Kanambo to work with her at his Kaka Empire studios after videos of her freestyle rap went viral.
