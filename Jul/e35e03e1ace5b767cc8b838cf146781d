Four presidential candidates were cleared by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to contest at the August 9 general election. They are George Wajackoyah of Roots Party, Raila Odinga of Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party and William Ruto of the United Democratic Alliance, UDA. The Star fact check desk did a backgroud check and brings you profiles of the four flag-bearers. GEORGE WAJACKOYAH Early Life George Luchiri Wajackoyah was born on 24 October 1959 in Jinja Uganda to Tom Olilo Jakoya and Melenia Makhoha. Despite being born in Uganda, George is Kenyan since both parents were Kenyans. Wajackoyah grew up in Indangalasia village in West Wanga, Mumias, Kakamega County, Kenya. This was also the village where the dad was born and raised. George’s parents divorced when he was young and therefore remained under the care of his paternal grandparents. The mother moved away from the matrimonial home, while the father moved back to Uganda and remarried there. At age 16, George stowed away to Nairobi and stayed in the streets until he was rescued by the Hari Krishna who gave him and other street children shelter. He converted to Hare Krishna and later became Krishna Balaram. He was given a chance to continue his education, joining St.Peter’s Boys High School in Mumias where he sat for his A level exams in 1980.

His struggle against one-party dictatorship saw him detained twice (from 1982 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991) during the rule of Jomo Kenyatta's successor, Daniel arap Moi. He was initially imprisoned for trying to stage a coup in 1982, which propelled him on to the national stage.” https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-21587054
