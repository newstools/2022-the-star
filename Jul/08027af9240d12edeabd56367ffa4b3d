Kenyatta University teams posted mixed results in their Kenya National Basketball League opening matches at Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on Sunday. KU ‘Pirates’ fell 73-62 to Eldonets. The visitors, who lost 77-65 to the University of Nairobi “Terrorists” trailed 29-28 at the break, took over 29-14 in the third quarter and maintained the tempo until the end. “Our defence leaked for a period of time and they took the advantage of that,” said KU coach Caleb Osewe. “We just lost focus that our plans never worked but at least we did learn something since this was just our first match this season.” James Omweno led Eldonets with 18 points while KU’s main man of the game was Dolph Otieno, who connected for game-high 26 points. “Our experience bailed us out. It was a seasaw affair until we took over in the third quarter. We weren’t ready to lose two games,” said Renny Moibi, the Eldonets guard. In the ladies' tie, KU Oryx clobbered Eldonets 53-35 behind a strong display from Sally Gicovy, who dropped a game-high 27 points.
