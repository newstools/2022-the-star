Kenya Morans got a sigh of relief on Thursday evening after it emerged that Fiba had agreed to bail out the struggling national team for the  World Cup 2023 African Qualifiers Window Three that throws off on Friday in Egypt. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary, Ambrose Kisoi, confirmed that after a long back and forth struggle, the national team got the reprieve and the squad of 10 players was set to fly out at 23:45hrs Thursday through Dar es Salaam. Earlier, Kisoi had indicated how it had been tough to secure tickets for the team to the regional championships. Kenya are scheduled to play DR Congo in their Group ‘D’ opener in Alexandria, face hosts Egypt on Saturday and conclude with a clash against Senegal on Sunday. In their Window Two games in Dakar, Senegal in February, Kenya lost their three matches going down 56-66 to DR Congo, 105-51 to Egypt and 100-55. Morans had their backs to the wall and needed to post at least three wins to progress to the next phase of the tournament. The FIBA World Cup will be hosted by the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia from August 25 to September 10, 2023.
