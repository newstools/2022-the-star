The government has dispensed 110,000 title deeds to Kirinyaga residents since 2013, Transport CS James Macharia has said. He hailed the government for its commitment to ensuring Kenyans get the important land ownership document. Macharia said since the Jubilee administration took over the reins of power, at least six million title deeds have been issued. The CS was speaking on Thursday during the issuance of 60 title deeds to Kirinyaga residents. He urged residents not to sell their land but instead preserve it for their children and generations to come or use the documents to secure loans for income generating activities. "Land has the ability to appreciate in value, so please don't put your lands on sale instantly. Utilise it properly so it can help you and your family," the CS said. He also urged Kirinyaga residents to make wise decisions while choosing leaders next month. He cautioned residents against voting for irresponsible leaders who would later abandon them and government projects. The CS drummed up support for Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua, saying they are development-minded. "We already have projects that are ongoing across the country. One example is the Kenol-Sagana-Marua dual carriageway. Our wish is that you elect a responsible government that will ensure the project is complete," Macharia said. "I believe the individuals who will continue with the good work that President Uhuru Kenyatta has been doing are Raila and Karua." Also, present was Infrastructure PS Paul Maringa who expressed his gratitude to the government for overseeing the drive Edited by A.N
