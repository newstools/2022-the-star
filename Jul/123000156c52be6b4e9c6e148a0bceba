Deputy President William Ruto now wants president Uhuru Kenyatta to shun divisive remarks that may antagonise the nation ahead of the August 9, polls. In a bare-knuckle response to alleged threats from President Uhuru, the DP told off his boss saying it is him who made him president. Ruto said even if the president is not willing to support him, he should focus on campaigning for his preferred candidate Raila Odinga. He reminded the President of how he stood with him in his hour of need telling him that he should not turn his anger to his children. "Sisi ndio tulikusaidia, wacha kujifanya saizi eti, ama ni aje my friends. Sasa eti wewe unaanza kunithreaten mimi? Bora usiue watoto wangu. Lakini mm na wewe tafadhali tuheshimiane (We are the ones who voted for you for the presidency, and now you want to threaten me? as long as you do not harm my children, We should respect each other)," he said. Ruto went on to tell the Head of State to stop invoking his name in public attacks. He said even if he has opted for Raila, he should pay attention to marketing him rather than marketing him. "Namuambia rafiki yangu Uhuru Kenyatta, please, wakati ulikua unahitaji watu wa kusimama na wewe tulisimama na wewe to the last man. Huyo Kitendawili unatusukumia saa hizi ni jamaa amehangaisha Kenya na alikuhangaisha ata wewe (My friend Uhuru Kenyatta, the time you wanted someone to stand by you, we stood by you, to the last man. That Kitendawili man you are forcing on people is a man who troubled  Kenya and also tortured you)," he said.
