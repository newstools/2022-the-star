A Standard Eight pupil is suspected to have killed a woman and her three children, among them, an unborn infant in Poroko village, Narok County. Police found the bodies of Juliet Naeku's sons, 10-year-old Evans Mioki and five-year-old Eliot Leitipa, dumped 150 metres from their home on Monday before the suspect confessed to the killings. Trans Mara West Sub-County commander Hamisi Ganzallah said the suspect came to the police station in Kilgoris and gave contradictory statements raising suspicions. "The suspect came to Kiligoris police station and told us that he had been attacked and injured by criminals while heading home," he said. According to Ganzallah, the police noticed the suspects had been injured and wanted to know more details about the attack. "But as the police were recording his statements, he gave conflicting information on what really transpired that's when the police asked the suspect to direct them to the scene of the incident," he said. On the way, the police came across a group of people helping a pregnant woman identified as Juliet Naeku who had been badly injured. Unaware the boy was related to the injured woman, police took her to St Joseph's Mission Hospital where she received treatment and was later referred to Narok County Hospital and died on Sunday. Police found two other bodies the following day (Monday) and took them to Kilgoris Mission Hospital mortuary in Narok. And as they were probing the deaths, the suspect is said to have confessed to solely killing the two boys and causing the death of their mother. Preliminary investigations show that the suspect allegedly stabbed his aunt severally and strangled the two boys.
