The legality of cannabis for medical and recreational use varies by country. More than 50 countries have legalised the use of marijuana with at least six allowing its recreational use. In Africa, Malawi, South Africa, Rwanda and Zimbabwe have legalised the use of marijuana. South Africa, Canada, Georgia, Malta, Mexico and Uruguay, plus 19 states in the United States of America and the Australian Capital Territory allow its rectreational use. There has been debate over whether marijuana should be made legal in Kenya, with the debate advancing after a presidential candidate promised to legalise it if elected. Experts have shared the benefits of legalising marijuana, including health, economic and social benefits. Marijuana has medicinal properties Medical marijuana is most commonly used for pain relief, especially nerve pain. Cannabis products, especially products high in CBD, may help to treat symptoms of depression, improve sleep, and alleviate symptoms of anxiety. Marijuana can help with low libido, experts say.

In California, for instance, in 2021 marijuana tax revenue was almost $1.3 billion (Sh153.2 billion).

The time, resources and energy can be channeled to enforcing other violent crimes such as sexual offences and robbery.
