UDA presidential candidate William Ruto on Friday reiterated the remarks that his administration will protect the church if he clinches the presidency in August. Speaking at a fellowship with the Nakuru County clergy at Ngata, Ruto promised church leaders that he will not let them down, thanking them for their continued support. "Thank you so much for praying for us. You don't know what you have done for us, just by this simple prayer." "Tutasimama juu ya imani na tutahakikisha Kenya inaendelea kuwa ni nchi ambayo inamcha Mungu... We will protect and defend the word of God in Kenya," he said. This is loosely translated to, "We will stand by faith and make sure that Kenya continues to be a God-fearing country... We will protect and defend the word of God in Kenya". Ruto acknowledged that the journey to reunite Kenyans, between him and his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta began in Nakuru. The DP commended that the religious leaders for choosing a side, adding that the Bible recommended it. "I want to congratulate the church. You have not shied away from taking a side. You know the word of God says one should not be lukewarm. It is better to be hot or cold," he said. Ruto said it is the will of God that the church is helping reunite Kenyans at this time, through their support. He vowed to make sure that politics of division will have no room in the nation if elected on August 9.
