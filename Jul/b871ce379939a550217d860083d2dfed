UDA presidential candidate William Ruto on Saturday sustained attacks on his rival Raila Odinga of Azimio la Umoja saying he is planning to reject election results. Speaking during a rally in Githurai, the Deputy President said Raila's insistence on the use of manual register during the August 9 polls is part of the grand plan to reject the outcome of the polls. "Tunakujua wewe umeanza ile njama yako ya kawaida. Tukifika karibu na uchaguzi unasema kura inataka kuibiwa. Lakini tunajua hiyo ni njama ya wewe kukataa matokeo ya uchaguzi," Ruto said. This translates to: "We know you and your ways, every election time you claim there are plans to rig elections but we know it's a strategy to reject election results." Raila and his Azimio la Umoja Coalition One Kenya party have insisted that the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must provide a manual register at polling stations on election day. They say this will act as a complementary voter identification system in the event that the electronic system fails. But Ruto said Raila and his team are laying the track to reject poll results. "Lakini nakupatia warning ya mapema, mwaka huu hakuna kujiapisha, hakuna kutupa mawe (But I'm forwarning you, this year ther is no swearing yourself in, there will be no stone throwing," Ruto said. The two leaders on Saturday concentrated their campaigns in the city after holding county campaign rallies over the past week. Ruto started off by attending a church service at Nyayo Stadium before heading to Udungu Grounds in Lang'ata constituency. He told Raila to stop issuing ultimatums to the IEBC.
