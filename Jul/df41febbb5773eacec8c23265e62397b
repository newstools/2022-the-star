A man who allegedly raped a woman at a local pub in Kibera on Friday has been charged with gang rape. The accused is said to have colluded with the brother to the woman, who is still at large. Albert Ngutu Samwa appeared before Kibera magistrate William Tulei on Friday. He denied the charges. According to the charge sheet, the two allegedly committed the offence on June 24 at Katwekere in Kibera subcounty, Nairobi. Samwa was charged with another count of committing an indecent act with an adult. According to the court papers, the woman had allegedly paid his brother a visit at the pub. The pub belongs to his brother. When she was done, the accused person, who was taking Cocacola at the pub allegedly called her by her nickname and told her he liked her. Samwa is then said to have urged her to sit close to him and started touching her private parts indecently.  The woman was unwell and had no energy to confront him. Court papers say moments later, the brother to the woman went downstairs and closed the door giving the accused person time to rape his sister. When the brother came back, he found the accused person done with the offence and he descended on the woman with slaps. The woman was later thrown out of the premises by her brother and she went and narrated to her sister what had occurred. The matter was reported to the police and the accused person was arrested and arraigned in court. He denied the charges before the court and said that he never committed the offence. The magistrate granted him a bond of Sh800,000 and directed that the matter be mentioned on July 28 for further directions. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
