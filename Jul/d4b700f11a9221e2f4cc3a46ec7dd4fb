Energy CS Monica Juma has lauded Mwingi women and youth for owning land. She said she is pleased to see the women and youth empowered to own land that can be used as collateral for self development. The CS spoke on Tuesday when she issued more than 74,000 title deeds to residents of Mwingi town, Kitui. She said the larger Mwingi alone will get 47,000 deeds. Juma said the process is in line with the President's agenda and the titles will be moved closer to residents in chief's offices. She also urged leaders and residents to conduct peaceful elections. "Our region is known for peace, let's maintain that." Kitui county commissioner Mbogai Rioba who was in attendance urged residents to collect their deeds at his office. He also urged them to take care of the papers by keeping them in safe places. Rioba said by July 20, all title deeds should have been distributed to land owners. A beneficiary Mary Mwikali lauded the exercise saying the elderly who cannot make it to land offices in Mwingi will pick them up from the nearby chief's office. Resident Ann Mutua said they have waited for years for the titles but are grateful after receiving them. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
