Kenya Union of Post Primary Education had called on the government to provide more security in bandit-prone areas. KUPPET secretary general Akello Misori said teachers in those areas need to be provided with more security. "We call upon the government to apprehend the perpetrators of the heinous crime and bring them to book. The killing has spread fear among all teachers in Baragoi and the larger Baringo North," he said. Misori was reacting to the death of a Baragoi High school teacher who was allegedly attacked by bandits "Cyrus James Karukura, a hardworking teacher of English and Literature at Baragoi Boys High School, was brutally killed by bandits. Our condolences go to his family, colleagues, friends and relatives," Misori said. Misori asked the government to deal with the perpetrators, adding that teachers in the area are now leaving in fear. "The killing has debunked the government’s recent assurances about improved security in the region," he said. Misori, therefore, urged teachers in the affected areas to remain safe. Given the clearly deteriorating situation we advise teachers to stay away from school if the situation warrants it," he added.
