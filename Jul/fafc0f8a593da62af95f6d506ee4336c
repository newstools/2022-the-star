Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will beat his arch-political rival William Ruto in a presidential race if Kenyans go to the ballot today, a new survey indicates. The findings by Trends and Insights Africa (TIFA) shows that 42 per cent of Kenyan voters identify with Raila compared to 39 per cent who said they will vote for William Ruto. “Raila has a slight lead of 3 per cent against Ruto,” Tom Wolf, Tifa Lead Researcher said. The poll had +/- 2.34 margin of error. This technically means the country will go for a runoff as none of the top two candidates would cross the 50 plus one victory mark. However, 10 per cent of those polled are still undecided, 28 days to elections. The report released on Monday also has George Wajackoyah at a distant third with 4 per cent of the total votes. The survey conducted between June 25 to June 30 interviewed 1,533 respondents from nine regions across the country.
