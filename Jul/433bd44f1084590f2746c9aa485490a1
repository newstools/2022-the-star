Government Spokesperson Cyrus Oguna has decried the handout culture, known in Luo Nyanza as ‘Yuko Jamna’, during this electioneering period. Oguna was addressing youths at the Siaya county IEBC hall on Tuesday where he urged young voters to not worsen their future by electing candidates without ideas. In the past election circles, Luos referred to the act of picking handouts from politicians as ‘gonya’ but the term has since metamorphosed into ‘yuko jamna’. ‘Yuko jamna’ loosely translates to shaking a tree of the purple fruit. Figuratively, it means the politician is on top of a huge tree of purple fruit and voters under it are all eyes —faces up —to pick the fruits as the politician shakes the tree. Youths who attended the meeting informed Oguna that the politicians give as low Sh50 and as high as Sh500, depending on the might of the position that they are seeking. Those who want to be MCAs give even Sh50 and those who want bigger positions, like governor, offer up to Sh500 but Sh200 is the most common, the youths said. “We are learned people. We went to school to think. Please do not get it wrong on the ballot because of Sh200 which will never help you,” the governor spokesperson said. The Sh200, Oguna said, cannot even buy a half kilogramme of beef. Oguna, who hails from Pap Nyadiel village in Alego, Siaya county, said politicians who give handouts will not pick phone calls as soon as they assume office. Instead, he urged voters to ask the candidates if they have any plan of supporting the creativity of jobless young people. He further said the government has various opportunities for young people. He reminded residents that health services are devolved, and electing a good governor will help sort out the mess currently being experienced in the sector. Further, Oguna asked Siaya residents to embrace ‘uchaguzi bila noma’ (peaceful election).  (edited by Amol Awuor)
