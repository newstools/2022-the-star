A manager in the office of Bungoma Woman Representative Catherine Wambilianga was Thursday found dead in a Webuye lodging. The body of Moses Nabibia was found in a lodging at Misikhu market in Webuye West constituency. His wife Joseline Nabibia said he left home on Wednesday for his daily duties at the MP's office but did not return. His phone did not go through either. She asked police to probe the death. “Today is a black day for the family after we received this distressing information. My husband has never had complications and I'm saddened by his untimely death,” she said. Wambilianga eulogised Nabibia as a dedicated worker, adding that her office has lost a good person. She called for calm as police probe the matter. Wambilianga was accompanied by Kabuchai MP Majimbo Kalasinga, among other Ford Kenya leaders. Nabibia was also the Ford Kenya organising secretary for Bungoma county. The body was taken to Lugulu Mission mortuary. Edited by A.N
