An elders council in Teso North has denied claims it signed a memorandum of understanding in support of Busia governor candidate Paul Otuoma. The Iteso Cultural Union elders, who addressed the press in Amagoro town on Sunday, said claims that they signed an MoU with Otuoma are falsehoods peddled by people who want to taint the image of the council. They said the council is an independent entity that has the capacity to make decisions without external influence. “We are intensively consulting on the best candidate to support and we will advise the community accordingly,” Iteso Cultural Union Kenya region chairman Bramwel Osogol said. “Those claiming we have already endorsed a candidate in the race for Busia governor are wrong. We are not in support of any candidate. However, we will give the community direction before we go to elections.” Osogol said Teso North's Iteso Cultural Union executive members will weigh who best fits to succeed Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. Candidates in the race are Otuoma, Nambale MP John Bunyasi, former education chief officer Dan Mogoria and Michael Oloo. “We are still in discussion and we will make it clear who we support in a few days,” Osogol said. He said the elders’ council will meet all the governor aspirants before they decide on who to back in the race. Ojaamong's term ends this year after serving two consecutive terms. Cornel Omaset, the Iteso Cultural Union Kenya region deputy chairman, said the Iteso will vote as a bloc on August 9. He said the community will back a candidate who will guarantee development in Teso subregion. Otuoma is vying for governorship for the second time. He unsuccessfully contested against Ojaamong in 2017. Bunyasi, Mogoria and Oloo are vying for the first time. The Iteso Cultural Union brings together members of the Teso community in Kenya, Uganda and the diaspora. Edited by A.N
