The electoral commission will on Monday open the 2022 National Election Conference at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, Nairobi. The forum under the theme ‘Moving Kenya Towards a Stronger Democracy’ will assess Kenya’s preparedness towards a fair, peaceful and credible election. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to grace the opening of the two-day event at the KICC alongside all the four presidential candidates cleared to vie at the polls. These are Azimio la Umoja’s Raila Odinga, his UDA counterpart William Ruto, George Wajackoyah of Roots Party and Agano Party’s David Waihiga. Also invited is the African Union (AU) Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat and chairpersons from other electoral management bodies. Chief Justice Martha Koome, Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chair Wafula Chebukati and commissioners will also be in attendance. Representatives from the National Police Service (NPS), Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Elections Observation Group (ELOG) and the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) will also attend. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC), Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), and the Office of the Registrar of Political Parties (ORPP) are also among those invited. The IEBC has stressed that stakeholder engagement is key for them to deliver a free, fair, credible and verifiable election. On Friday last week, the IEBC hosted the 2022 General Elections Observation briefing forum at the Bomas of Kenya where various accredited election observers attended. The Commission also issued out a guideline to the accredited election observers on how they should prepare their reports after observing the 2022 general elections.
