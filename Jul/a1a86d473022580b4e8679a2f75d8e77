Presidential aspirant Reuben Kigame has blamed the electoral body for not considering the constitutional provision for people living with disabilities. Kigame, speaking in an interview with Spice FM on Tuesday, said Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) did not publish any appointment in braille form. "The commission did not use exception on the youths and people living with disability, I never saw any appointment written in braille, they were setting the bar high for me," Kigame said. He accused IEBC of not developing any regulations to accommodate persons living with disability or providing any other form of communication. He said he did not ask for much from the commission, not even a special treatment. "I just wanted a fair process from IEBC and follow the law considering that I brought all the qualifications and the signatures which were required, not because of my blindness," Kigame said. He alleged that commission officials gave him the runaround when he tried to submit his paperwork and kept him waiting for hours before declaring he had missed the deadline. The presidential aspirant added the number of days left to the general election date is enough for him to campaign and win. "One day in politics is a long time, we might not go to every village but we will convince Kenyans to vote for me," Kigame added. Justice Antony Mrima ruled that IEBC discriminated against Kigame by locking him out of the presidential election. The Presidential hopeful and gospel singer got relief on Monday after the Court ordered IEBC to consider his papers. "My government will focus first on the top leaders in the government who are corrupt, then fix the economy," he said. In his statement, he is looking forward to improving the country's economy  if elected.
