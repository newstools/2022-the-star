The National Transport and Safety Authority has said the multi-agency team that was mandated to investigate the Nithi Bridge accident, is set to receive and discuss the initial preliminary crash report this week. NTSA said part of the information availed for deliberations is the Vehicle's travel manifest, maintenance program, driver records, and the Company's safety policy among other documents. "The Team is expected to identify the cause, and propose immediate and long-term measures to prevent the occurrence of such fatal crashes," NTSA said in a statement. On Monday, NTSA halted the operations of Modern Coast Express Limited after one of its buses was involved in an accident at the Nithi bridge Sunday evening. The death toll from the accident stood at the notorious black spot rose to 35 on Monday, Eastern Regional Commissioner Evans Achoki confirmed. The driver of the ill-fated bus lost control of the vehicle before it went off the guard rails and plunged into River Nithi in Tharaka Nithi county along the Meru - Mombasa highway. "A thorough multi-agency investigation into the crash and an evaluation of the operator's safety operational standards is currently underway," NTSA Director General George Njao said in a statement Monday. "Additionally, we note that all vehicles belonging to the Company have halted their operations and the order remains in force until further notice." The suspension will affect the company's operations on the Nairobi-Mombasa and Nairobi-Thika-Embu-Meru-Maua routes.
