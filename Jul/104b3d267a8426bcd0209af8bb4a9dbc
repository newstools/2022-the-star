A man and his wife accused of causing serious wounds to the buttocks of a four year old boy were charged at a Kibera court. On Thursday, Samuel Adega and Irene Nduku were arraigned before Kibera senior Principal Magistrate Monica Maroro where they denied the allegations. The charge sheet said they jointly committed the offence on diverse dates at an unknown time in Parklands, Westlands Sub-county within Nairobi county. Nduku, the mother to the child, was separately charged with the second count of  infringing the right of the child by refusing to administer medicine to the child. She denied the third count of failing to protect the child from physical abuse in line with the law. According to a police report, the authorities received a phone call informing them that there was a child who looked as if he had been defiled. The officers rushed to the scene and upon arrival they found the boy writhing in pain. The police report says that the child said he was burned with hot water in his buttocks. He was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and taken to a children home. They were later arrested and booked at the police station before they were arraigned in court. In court, the accused persons urged the court to release them on lenient bond terms through their lawyer. The lawyer told the court that the accused person were not in a position to pay harsh bond terms. On the same note, the court refused to allow the mother a chance to pay a visit to the boy as she requested. Speaking through the lawyer, the mother told the court that the boy was at a children home and that he was missing the motherly love. In response, Maroro declined the request and urged them to keep away from the child until the orders are reviewed. She also released them on Sh500,000 bond and directed that the matter be mentioned later this month for a pre-trial.
