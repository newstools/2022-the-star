Kiambu county has been the second-highest contributor to the country’s total Gross Domestic Product from 2013 to 2020, a report has revealed. The county follows Nairobi which was the highest contributor to Kenya’s GDP. “The county accumulated a range of 5 per cent to 10 per cent, with 2015 the highest notable year at 6.03 per cent,” Kenya County Fact Sheets reads. The report was compiled by the Commission for Revenue Allocation. Residents in the county which houses more than 2.4 million people have benefited from a wide range of services in the county. “By 2019, 86 per cent of households could access safe drinking water, and 91.9 per cent had access to electricity. Another 66 per cent owned mobile phones,” the report reads. In 2018-19 Kiambu generated the highest own source revenue amounting to Sh2.7 billion but this was reduced to Sh2.4 billion in 2019-2020. “Donor loans and grants contributed a similar amount of Sh2.3 billion in 2019 and 2020. This might be due to the pandemic effects,” the report reads. However, the county received the highest conditional grant from the national government in summary from 2013 to 2020. The report further reveals that this has seen increased services and upgraded infrastructure in the county. “Some 453 level 2 health facilities, 96 level 3 health facilities and 22 level 4 health facilities in the private sector were constructed from 2015,” the report reads. Still, on matters health, the commission raised concern about the increased number of people living with HIV/ AIDS. “In 2012 there were 47,100 people living with HIV/AIDS, the number increased to 70,971 infected personnel in a span of 7 years,” the report reads. An improvement was also noted in the access to hospital delivery services, from 69.9 perc ent to 97.5 in a span of seven years. This means more expectant women delivered in hospitals and shunned home delivery. On access to education, the number of teachers in public ECDE centres in the county was half the number in private ECDE centres. “Some 1,252 teachers were enrolled in public centres while 2072 were enrolled in the private ECDE centres,” the report reads. However, the county has only 515 public ECDE centres and 953 private ECDE centres. Since the ECDE level of education is a devolved function, it is up to the counties to hire teachers and not the Teachers Service Commission. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
