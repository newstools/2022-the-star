Security agencies have been asked to give more protection to women candidates and their followers in the run-up to August 9. Statistics by Fida-Kenya indicate violence against women in politics has increased as the election nears. Agnes Njambi, the Jubilee candidate for Nakuru Woman Representative, said protecting women will ensure they have a chance to sell their agenda before the August 9 general election. A large number of women will have a chance to narrow the gender gap that has failed time and time in elections and in Parliament. "We want the government to provide us with enough security, especially when we are going for rallies, because that is when we feel a bit scared. With good security we will be able to sell our agenda to the people," Njambi said. She said decorum is necessary, especially in campaign rallies so leaders can show good example to young people and future politicians. Asked about the leadership will provide, Njambi said, "A woman is someone special in the community. They oppose corruption, especially knowing that other people are suffering. We will be very positive about the community." She said women have been treated slightly better than in the 2017 election. She said this atmosphere has contributed to generally people nominations especially in the Jubilee Party where nominations were held through opinion polls. “Party nominations were the biggest headache for women during the 2017 polls. Nominations are generally highly contested and not well organized, so we had to overcome a lot of hurdles at that time. The former Independent candidate for the same seat thanked the Jubilee party for using the opinion poll method to get the strongest candidate. “This is the way to go, this way more women are assured of seats especially when they pass the biggest challenge of the party primaries,” Njambi said.
