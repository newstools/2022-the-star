Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua went against the will of Kirinyaga people to support Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has said. She said Kirinyaga residents have not shifted their allegiance from UDA despite the appointment of Karua as Raila’s running mate. Waiguru said voters in the area have refused to back Raila even after he appointed one of their own because the two (Raila and Karua) have nothing to offer in terms of taking Kenya forward. "Karua ignored the ground and opted to sell another candidate knowing so well that this was a UDA stronghold," she said. Waiguru said the area is a UDA stronghold and the party's wave will sweep away all Azimio and independent candidates. The governor was addressing a rally at Kamweti centre in Gichugu. She said it will be an uphill task for Karua's Narc Kenya party to bag even one seat in the county. Waiguru urged residents to vote six-piece for UDA. "Tutatumia wheelbarrow kupeleka Raila na Karua nyumbani baada ya uchaguzi unaokuja" she said. This loosely translates to "We will use wheelbarrows to take Raila and Karua home after the election." Waiguru also dismissed as "propaganda" polls showing Raila is leading in the presidential contest. She told her opponents in the governor's race to brace themselves for a bruising battle on the ballot. Waiguru said the seat is not given on a silver platter and each candidate has to justify their manifesto to residents. “My opponents are having a difficult time explaining what they want to do since my government has fulfilled most of the promises across the socio-economic sectors,” she said. Waiguru exuded confidence she will retain the governor’s seat, saying her campaigns are agenda-based.
