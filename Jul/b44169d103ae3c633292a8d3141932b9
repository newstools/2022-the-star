Tanzanian singer Diamond will get married when ready to retire from music. In an interview with DW Africa, Diamond said 'wives' kill musicians' talents and careers. "What do you mean settling down? I've settled down," he said. He was then asked about getting married. "I still wanna give them more music. I still wanna give them more good music." He pointed out unnamed friends, whom he said no longer release good music because they got married. "That's why I feel like, let me give you guys the good music. The time I'm about to retire, I will get married." The Tanzanian artiste also explained why he is a global talent. "I think that everybody has something to him or her, and you need to find what you are blessed with," he said. "I'm so cool with everybody. I don't have a problem with anybody, I work so hard and created my own way." Diamond said his creativity has put him among the top artistes globally. "I'm trying to see what can go with me," he said. "I have my way, you need to be very creative, you need to be very smart. So I feel like because I put in more than 100 per cent in my work, I'm trying to be as creative as I can, trying to make sure I satisfy my fans." It's difficult, sometimes, but I'm trying to be me. I'm trying to be the real me so people can get whatever they see. Whether it is good or bad, it made me who I am." Diamond said he has many unreleased collaborations because he isn't feeling some of the songs despite being recorded and ready for release. "If I don't like the song, I don't do it. It doesn't matter how big you are, I will tell you this," he said. "I've got a lot of songs with the biggest artistes but I've never released them."
