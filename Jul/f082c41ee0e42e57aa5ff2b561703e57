National women’s 100m champion Maximila Imali, has been dropped from the Kenya team to the World Athletics Championships set to start on Friday in Oregon after failing to undergo the mandatory three dope tests. 2019 All African Games 400m bronze medallist, had qualified by ranking as she sits in the 51 position in 200m and 47 in 100m. In an interview,  Imali’s coach Dennis Mwanzo Ongeri said they have to contend with Commonwealth Games after failing to meet the World Championships threshold. " We have no choice but to focus on Commonwealth Games, where I expect Imali to finish on the podium. As much as we were prepared for the World Championships, we have to accept our current situation because the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) demands that every athlete undergoes three mandatory dope tests, which we didn't," he added. He said they were looking forward to a very competitive World Championships but as it is, they have to make do with the Commonwealth Games and ensure they return home with a gold medal. “ The most important thing is that we have learned the hard way and since we will still have World Championships next year, we will start pretty early and work with Anti-Doping Agency Kenya and WADA," he added. The other athletes who had qualified but will not go due to the anti-doping restrictions are African Championships bronze medallist  Veronica Mutua ranked 45 in 400m and Wiseman Were, ranked 32 in men's 400m. Kenya is listed under Category A on the World Anti-doping Agency's watchlist for anti-doping violations.
