Vihiga UDA Senate candidate Jackson Swadi says he will deliver the seat to Kenya Kwanza alliance. He dismissed an opinion poll that placed nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi in the lead saying such surveys have been manipulated. Swadi spoke to Star via the phone on Monday evening after concluding his campaigns in Bunyore. The survey by Infotrak showed Osotsi was leading at 45.7 per cent followed by Babira Ndeda at 22.6 per cent. Swadi was third with 16.3 per cent. “Opinion polls don’t vote​. It is the ​ people who vote and they can’t be manipulated no matter the situation. “We have seen even in the presidential race they say that Raila Odinga is leading, it's okay but come August 9 we shall see,” Swadi said. He said voters w​​ill make their choices on the ballot and their decision can’t be changed by anybody. Swadi further said with his political experience, he is sure of delivering compared to other candidates. “I have served as a councillor in Nairobi, and MCA for two terms in Nandi county. That experience is enough for me to serve Vihiga people as their senator,” he said. Swadi said he won't be a senator who blames the governor but will keep him on toes to ensure he delivers to the people of Vihiga. He said he has an upper hand to clinch the seat as the likes of Ndeda, Tyson Majani, Sisco Mbindi are non-starters. Swadi who is currently taking his campaigns to Osotsi’s backyard, has been in Illungu, Emanyinya, Ebusilatsi, Emusire and Es’saba in Emuhaya subcounty. He has further extended his campaigns to Luanda South, Wemilabi, Mwibona, Emabungo and parts of Luanda township in Luanda subcounty. The senatorial race in Vihiga county has intensified with only 20 days left to general election. This comes after the incumbent George Khaniri declined to defend the seat and wants ​to ​unseat Governor Wilber Ottichilo. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
