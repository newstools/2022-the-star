Roots party Presidential candidate George Wajackoyah has refuted claims he holds United Kingdom citizenship. Wajackoyah in a past interview said he was once disqualified from vying for a member of parliament seat in Tottenham, UK because he was not married. Speaking on NTV, Wajackoyah said he has never changed his citizenship despite him vying for the MP position. "These people ought to read. They ought to just go to the internet and google. They are wasting their time writing to the embassy. Nobody is deporting me as I'm a Kenyan by birth with high levels of education," Wajackoyah said. "I've been outside the country, suffered enough and tried to run for an MP seat. As a commonwealth, if you have lived in the UK, you do not necessarily need to be a citizen." Wajackoyah's response comes hot on the heels of a letter by  Former presidential aspirant Peter Solomon Gichira who wrote to the British high commission questioning the status of his UK citizenship. He sought to know whether he renounced his UK citizenship. Gichira said Wajackoyah cannot be allowed to run for president if he still holds UK citizenship because the Constitution bars a candidate with dual citizenship. "If the UK confirms that Wajackoyah is their citizen then it means he cannot run for elections in Kenya," Gichira said. The Constitution of Kenya 2010 says a person is not eligible for election or appointment to a state office unless the person is a citizen. All state officers and members of the defence forces are not allowed to hold dual citizenship.
