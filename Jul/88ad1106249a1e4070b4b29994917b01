Opinion remains divided amongst Kenyans on whether or not all four presidential candidates should feature in the presidential debate at the same time. A Twitter poll conducted by the Star on the matter attracted varied responses from Kenyans on the social platform, with some vouching for all candidates to debate on one platform, while others want the status quo maintained. The current arrangement by the Presidential Debate Secretariat is to have a two tier debate; the first featuring candidates whose popularity in three most recent polls stood below 5 per cent while the second featuring candidates who polled above 5 per cent in the same surveys. The presidential debate will be held on Tuesday, July 26 at the Catholic University of East Africa (CUEA) Nairobi. "Yes and have two sessions and a break in between. Each session ensure key issues are discussed not personal poking of issues. The DP presidential debate would have," Egline Samoei said. However, Billium Wamalwa differed with the above opinion saying the debates should be tiered just like the deputy presidential debate. "We should have semis and finals. In the semis we should have Wajackoya vs Ruto then Wajackoya qualifies for the finals. In the same Mwaure should face Raila. Then Raila qualifies for the finals. In the finals Wajackoya should face Raila Odinga. As a result Wajackoya surrenders," he said. Here is what other Kenyans said;
