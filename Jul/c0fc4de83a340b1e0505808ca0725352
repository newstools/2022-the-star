Kenya's medal hopes in the 1,500m went up in smoke as defending champion Timothy Cheuriyot and Abel Kipsang finished sixth and seventh at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon. In a poorly executed race, Cheruiyot finished a disappointing sixth, clocking 3:30.69 as Africa champion Abel Kipsang, who had led in the opening two laps faded badly finishing seventh in  3:31.21. Great Britain's Jake Wightman upset the field to win gold in a world leading time of 3:29.23 as Olympic champion Filip Ingrebrigsten of Norway settled for silver in 3:29.47. Spain's Mohammed Katir took bronze  in 3:29.90. Wightman's  time is the 2nd fastest 1,500 at the World Championship, after 3:27.65 by morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj in 1999. His gold medal is the first for Great Britain in the 1,500m since Steve Cram won the inaugural World Championship at Helsinki in 1983. Ingebrigtsen led most of the first 3 laps alongside Cheruiyot but Wightman passed  the Norwegian near the end of the backstretch on the final lap. Ingebrigtsen's silver was his 2nd medal in the 1,500 and the 2nd medal for his family, as Jakob’s brother, Filip Ingebrigtsen, won bronze in 2017.
