A 32-year-old journalist Purity Ngungu has rolled up her sleeves and dived into the murky waters of elective politics. The youthful graduate of the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication, who formerly served on the Kitui governor's press team is seeking the Nairobi South ward representatives seat. Ngungu said joining politics was not by default as she is taking after her father,  a former councillor. "I am a firstborn daughter of former Endau councilor, Josephat Ngungu Musembi. My dad is my inspiration," she said. She is seeking the seat under the Usawa Kwa Wote party. "I have an agenda for the people of Nairobi South. I will push to see the government pay NHIF for all Kenyans since more than half the population do not have a cover," she said. She said she empathised with the youths in public universities, who are attending lectures on an empty stomach because they cannot afford a decent meal. "I want the Kenyan government to pay for meals for university and college students because one can not learn on an empty stomach. The government has the capacity to do that," she said. She said she will also ensure there are equal opportunities for all Kenyans including the youth, women and the marginalised. "I want every family in Nairobi South to feel that they belong to Kenya because I will treat everyone equally without discrimination," she said. She noted that the Usawa Kwa Wote party advocates for equity for all Kenyans. "I thank God for Usawa. I am going to defend our mothers, students and everybody. I hope the people will give me the opportunity to serve them," she said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
