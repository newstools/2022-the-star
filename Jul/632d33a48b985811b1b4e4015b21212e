The National Council for People with Disabilities (NCPWD) is looking to have all Kenyans living with disabilities registered afresh. According to Leonard Dawafula, the Nairobi County Coordinator for NCPWD, this exercise is meant to make sure that genuine people living with disabilities (PLWDs) are registered. "We have people who have been illegally registered as PLWDs as well as those who have faked details and gotten fake identification cards as PLWDs," he said. He was speaking during a working group sector committee meeting convened by Flone Initiative in Nairobi. The committee was discussing the limitations of people living with disabilities while navigating the city of Nairobi. The Committee consisted of officials from the Nairobi Metropolitan Services, under various departments. Dawafula said that some people have also been procuring the services of unscrupulous or unqualified individuals posing as medical practitioners. They would then get assessed by the fake practitioners and be categorised as disabled under various disability categories. "With this new registration will see that security features are placed in the ID card and only genuine people living with disabilities will be registered in the system," he said. He added that the new registration will also see those with disabilities that were not previously recognised are now acknowledged. "Permanent disabilities such as the skin condition Vitiligo will also be recognised and Kenyans living with the condition will be registered," he said. Dawafula said that the registration exercise would take place at the counties so no one needs to come all the way to Nairobi. The finalisation would happen at Afya House in Nairobi.
