Former Kilimani DCI boss Fatuma Hadi was on Sunday honoured by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations for exemplary academic excellence. Hadi graduated as the best overall student in a recently concluded senior staff course held in Rwanda. The detective emerged top of the class in the Police Senior Command and Staff Course in a class of 34 students drawn from eight countries. Hadi is best remembered for orchestrating the arrest of three men who were caught on camera sexually assaulting a lady in a Guthurai-bound bus in 2014. There was public uproar after a video of the incident was circulated on social media. The three, a driver, a conductor and petrol station attendant were sentenced to death in July 2017 after being found guilty of robbing and sexually assaulting the woman on the night of September 19, 2014. "What you thought was a joke should not be taken lightly as a woman's privacy and decency should be respected at all times," chief magistrate Francis Andayi said while passing the judgment. Hadi's no-nonsense attitude has earned her the moniker "iron lady" from her peers and those who have worked closely with her.
