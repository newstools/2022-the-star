Diamond Platnumz's wants a woman who will spend on him. Diamond shared a photo of Alicia Keys being gifted a diamond necklace by her husband Swizz Beats. Diamond wrote, "I need a lady to surprise me like this. That's when I might believe that she is in love with me and not after my money." In December last year, he shared a pair of Bottega Veneta tire boots that he was given as a Christmas gift, gushing over his 'girlfriend'. In a recent post on Instagram, Diamond shared a video of himself shirtless while gyrating his waist. In the clip, Diamond advertised his abs, prompting fans to question his motives. Responding to the comment, Diamond said it was time he added another child.
