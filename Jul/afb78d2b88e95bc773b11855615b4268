Kenya's economy grew 6.8 per cent in the first quarter of the year driven largely by the recovery of key sectors from the Covid-19 pandemic and sound macroeconomic environment. The expansion is higher compared to 2.7 per cent growth in the first quarter of 2021 when most economic activities contracted significantly  due to measures instituted to curb the spread of Covid-19. Quarterly Gross Domestic Product Report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows significant recovery was recorded in transportation and storage sector (8.1%), accommodation and food serving activities (56.2%). Professional, administrative and support services also grew 14.9 per cent while other service activities expanded 11.1 per cent. "The growth was also supported by accelerated growths in manufacturing, wholesale and retail activities and financial and insurance activities coupled with sustained growth in construction, real estate and information and communication activities,"  KNBS director general Mcdonald Obudho said. Even so, the growth was constrained by contraction in agricultural activities mainly owing to insufficient during the preceding quarter as well as delayed long rains during the period under review. Macroeconomic indicators showed mixed performance during the quarter under review. Inflation eased from an average of 5.79 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 to 5.34 per cent in the first quarter of 2022. However, price hike of various food basket items drove inflation to a five-year high of 7.9 per cent in June, up from 7.1 per cent in May. The cost of living has been rising on a monthly basis since February, hitting 7.1 per cent in May. This is partly attributed to Ukraine - Russia crisis which has stoked energy and food prices after choking the global supply chain.
