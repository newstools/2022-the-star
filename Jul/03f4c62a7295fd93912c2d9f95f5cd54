Directorate of Criminal Investigations boss George Kinoti on Tuesday received visitors from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. Kinoti said he enjoys a longstanding partnership with the FBI and INL in the fight against transnational organized crimes specifically in combating human trafficking and crimes against children. "This has been achieved through information sharing, continuous training, as well as tooling and equipping of detectives with modern tools of the trade to manage crime," he said. Kinoti said the FBI and INL provided two Child Adolescent Forensic Interview (CAFI) kits in order to increase the capabilities of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Child Protection Unit These kits had earlier been identified by AHTCPU as essential to furthering their investigations into cases targeting children. The Kits were handed over to the Kinoti, at the DCI Headquarters in a ceremony presided over by the FBI International Operations Assistant Director, Alvin Winston. The CAFI kits were donated in honor of FBI Special Agents Dan Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger. Kinoti said they devoted their careers to investigating crimes against children and were murdered on February, 2, 2022 while serving a search warrant in a crime against children investigation in Florida, USA. In his remarks, Kinoti thanked the Federal Bureau of Investigations for the kits, adding that they would go far in enabling child protection officers generate watertight cases against suspects who abuse children. Later, the two discussed matters of mutual interest between the two investigative agencies. The FBI official were accompanied by the acting Section Chief Alexander Otte, among others senior FBI officials and staff at the United States embassy in Kenya.
