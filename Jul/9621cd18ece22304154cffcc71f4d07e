Sprinter Ferdinand Omanyala on Thursday received a United States visa to enable him travel for the World Athletics Championships. This follows an uproar from Kenyans on social media who faulted the US Embassy in Nairobi for the delay. The Star has however, established that Omanyala has finally obtained his visa and will be leaving the country at around 6 pm. The Kenyan sprinter is set to take part in the 100m event at the championships, which begin on Friday (Tomorrow). Omanyala set the African men's 100 metres record after clocking a time of 9.77 seconds at the Kip Keino Classic held in Nairobi in September 2021, earning him the title Africa's fastest man. He is also the first Kenyan to qualify for the Olympic 100m semi-finals in Tokyo last year.
