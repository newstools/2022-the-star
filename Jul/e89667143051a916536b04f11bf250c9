Governors have showcased their performance in the last nine years as the curtain falls for 21 pioneer county chiefs. In the State of Devolution Report by the Council of Governors, the county bosses have documented massive development milestones during their tenure. They said the country has witnessed transformation through devolution with key sectors such as health and agriculture seeing a turnaround. The county bosses also listed the challenges devolution faced over the period, with the late release of cash, corruption and retrogressive laws topping the list. Some 21 pioneer governors are exiting after serving two terms with 26 others currently serving their first terms. In health, CoG chairman Martin Wambora said that there has been improvement in all aspects – service delivery, human resource, infrastructure and financing. The Embu governor said the number of health facilities has increased by six per cent from 13, 190 in 2021 to 13,772. They include six national referral hospitals, 23 county referral hospitals, 886 subcounty hospitals, 2,180 health centres and 10,677 dispensaries. He disclosed that there is currently 1,278 functional critical care (ICU and HDU) beds across the country. This is partly attributed to Covid 19 pandemic that saw many counties set up the units. “The county governments are now targeting having facilities at five-kilometre radius moving around,” Wambora said in the report. Currently, 34.3 per cent of counties’ budget goes to health. With the improved services, Wambora held that the maternal mortality rate has reduced to 99.6 per 100,000 cases last year from 116.4 in 2014. The under-five mortality rate has also dropped by a margin of 7.4 from 47.78 to 40.34 per 100,000 live births. In Agriculture, the CoG boss said the counties allocated an average of 11 percent of their budgets in the sector, pushing the sector to grow by 5.1 per cent in the last financial year alone. “Overall, the value of marketed agricultural production increased by 4.3 percent from Sh505.3 billion in 2020 to Sh527.0 billion in 2021,” Wambora said. In the wake of climate change, he said, the counties have distributed 643, 686 assorted fruit trees, 45 tonnes of potatoes and subsidised inputs to farmers. “The counties have invested in agricultural machinery with additional 10 tractors purchased over and above 350 operating in 29 agricultural stations in 2021,” Wambora said. In a bid to combat drought in ASALs, 12 counties have enacted disaster management acts with 10 putting in place disaster management policies. Further, 2.7 million have benefited from relief food distributed by the counties with one million benefiting from water tracking by the devolved units. Some 13 counties have developed county emergency operation plans to provide a framework for coordinating preparedness, response and recovery activities. On risk management, 14 counties have established a directorate of disaster management and allocated a cumulative Sh258.81 million. In addition, eight counties have allocated two per cent of their annual budget to the county emergency fund kitty. Some 40 counties have established firefighting departments. In planning, housing and infrastructure the COG boss disclosed that the counties have heavily invested in urban infrastructure as some 202 km of roads have been done within the municipalities. Some 171 km of non-motorised and 5250 parking spaces were done. The counties have also installed 4533 streetlights in addition to 81 high masts lighting. Some 192 km of stormwater drains have been constructed, 31 km of sew line constricted, 12 forestation and 16 retail markets constructed. In trade and manufacturing, the counties have registered 124, 420 micro-enterprises, 87, 153 small enterprises, 34, 727 medium enterprises, and 8, 191 large enterprises. “To support MSMEs, 19 counties have established the county business enterprise funds to provide affordable loans, with the accumulative allocation of Sh334.5 million and a total of Sh7, 058 MSMEs benefitting,” he said. Twenty-four counties have automated the business registration services for easier business license registration and renewal. “The counties have also continued to rehabilitee and build markets, with 24 counties having constructed 127 new markets within the past one year while 25 counties having rehabilitated 118 old markets,” the report reads. In education, Wambora said, the counties have heavily invested in ECDE learning. Enrolment in pre-primary One and Two, went up by 0.4 per cent from 2.82 in 2020 to 2.84 million in the 2021 school year, The counties have recruited 50, 964 ECDE teachers with a total cumulative expenditure on pre-primary education for 2021-22 standing at Sh5.75 billion. The counties allocated and disbursed Sh3.58 billion bursaries to needy students. The counties also allocated 2.81 billion towards improving the quality of training offered by the vacation training. Despite the successes, however, the counties faced several challenges with Wambora decrying continued delayed disbursement of funds by the Treasury which has greatly affected service delivery Others are the establishment of national institutions through policy and legislation that undermine the functional integrity of counties. Corruption at both levels of county governments and slow implementation of intergovernmental decisions “The gains of devolution are immense and as we look forward to the next election, I urge the citizens to ensure that all candidates they elect are defenders of devolution,” Wambora said.
