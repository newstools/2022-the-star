Uganda's inspector general of police Martin Okoth Ochola has started investigations into Senator Sakaja's Teams university degree saga. The National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) Executive Director Mary Okwakol in a letter to Commission for University Education said they have stopped the probe on the matter following the latest move by the police IG. “NCHE commenced investigations in order to determine the authenticity of the Bachelor of Science in Management (External) degree awarded to Sakaja Johnson by Team University," the letter from NCHE read dated June 29. "However, prior to completion of our investigation, the Inspectorate of Government (IG) has commenced investigations into the same matter, hence superseding our action.” The NCHE added: “The purpose of this letter is, therefore, to inform you of the above development and to advise that a final position will be availed once the investigation by the IG is concluded.” CUE had tasked NCHE to probe the validity of Senator Sakaja's degree. The communique came a day before the CUE said Sakaja's degree is not eligible for recognition A letter by the commission's Chief Executive Officer Mwenda Ntarangwi said the Senator and NCHE failed to serve them with necessary documents to prove Sakaja acquired his degree procedurally. "Based on these findings and in compliance with the ongoing provisions of sections of The Universities Act, 2012, Part XI of The Universities Regulations 2014, The Universities Standards and Guidelines, 2014, and the Standards for recognition and Equation of qualifications and granted the disclaimer in the certificate of recognition issued, the Commission has come to the m inescapable decision to that the purported degree certificate of Bachelor of Science in Management (External) is ineligible for recognition," the letter state. CUE added: “Failure to submit the most basic evidence of study and the process of earning a degree inevitably renders the certificate submitted for recognition inefficient to prove that Sakaja studied either physically or through distance learning and that he holds an academic degree.”
