Over 250 golfers drawn from courses across the Rift Valley, Nairobi, Kisumu, Kakamega and Kisii are expected to compete for honours as the Safaricom Golf Tour goes down at the Par 73 Nakuru golf club this weekend. Nakuru-based 11-year-old junior golfer Peter Gathogo is among the favourites for Sunday’s juniors’ tournament after a victorious outing in Kitale three weeks ago. Elly Sorobea, who won his home tournament in the senior category after returning a total of 40 Stableford points, highlights the players gunning for another bite at the cherry. The Tour has so far been to ten locations across the country including Nanyuki, Limuru, Muthaiga, Nyanza, Machakos, Eldoret, Karen, Nyali, Kericho and Kitale; drawing over 5,000 golfers who have taken part in tournaments, junior clinics and outreach programmes. As part of growing the sport among junior players, Safaricom have partnered with the Junior Golf Foundation to tap and nurture young talents. The juniors can register with the Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) for Sh1,000, which grants them access to play at any golf club in the country.
