The Garissa government has launched a 10-day mass vaccination against yellow fever in Garissa Township, Lagdera and Balambala subcounties. The drive is in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization. Health executive Roble Nunow said the exercise was necessitated by an outbreak of yellow fever in Garissa and Isiolo counties. Nunow, who spoke to the press in his office Monday, said several cases have been reported in Garissa and Isiolo counties respectively. “A single case of yellow fever is considered an outbreak by WHO. That is why the state, the two county governments, WHO and UNICEF have decided to vaccinate people to stop further spread,” he said. Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes mainly the aedes species. Symptoms include fever, headache, jaundice, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. A small proportion of patients who contract the virus develop severe symptoms and approximately half die within seven to ten days. Nunow said the vaccination drive targets 263,000 residents aged between nine months and 60 years in the three subcounties that border Isiolo county. He said military personnel based at the Modigar camp in Garissa county will also receive the jab. “We have trained the military health personnel on how to administer the jab. The uptake is encouraging and by July 25, three days after the exercise was launched, we had vaccinated 44,340 people,” Nunow said. The executive appealed to all residents and those of neighbouring Tana River county to avail themselves for the vaccination assuring them that it is safe for all. “We appeal to residents of the targeted subcounties to avail themselves to our health workers who are doing door to door campaigns. “This is a-one jab vaccine in a lifetime. It is safe even for those with underlying health issues, for yellow fever prevention,” he said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
