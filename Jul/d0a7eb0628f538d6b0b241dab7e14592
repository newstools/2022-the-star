WhatsApp has finally rolled out more emoji reaction options for its users on Wednesday. This comes two weeks after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company was working on introducing more emoji reactions. The new development comes just a few months after WhatsApp added the ability to react with only six emojis. The feature is accessible by holding down the message you want to react to, before a menu with all emoji reactions pops up and you can simply choose the desired one. The first emoji reaction feature was rolled out in March. The app now includes a plus icon that lets you add more emoji reactions. The new feature was previously spotted in Beta versions on both iOS and Android but has now been rolled out globally.
