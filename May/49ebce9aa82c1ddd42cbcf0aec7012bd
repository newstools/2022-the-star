Jubilee senator aspirant George Maara has promised Kiambu residents he will lobby for more funding to the county if elected. Maara has opted to go for the Senate seat after three unsuccessful attempts to become Limuru MP. Kiambu Senator Kimani Wamatangi will not defend his seat as he is going for that of governor. On Saturday, Maara said he will push for better healthcare, agriculture and education. "I have good intentions to serve the people of Kiambu and I am vying for the senator seat," he said. He promised people-based leadership. "I will work with the community, government and all stakeholders that are interested in making sure we have a good education system," he said. Maara is the founder and patron of Jonathan Maara Primary School, a public institution in Limuru constituency which started in mid 1990s. He says the school has over 800 learners. The aspirant promised better oversight of the county government and the county assembly to ensure residents get services. "We'll push for higher allocation of funds to health services, construction and equipping of more health centres in all wards. I will initiate and support legislation that provides for free health care and accessibility of health services for all," he said. Maara will battle it out with Karungo wa Thangwa of UDA, Gathii Irungu (Tujibebe Wakenya Party) and Machel Waikenda (CCM).
