The Jomo Kenyatta Foundation has awarded scholarships to 148 learners who sat the 2021 KCPE exam. The scholarship worth Sh22.2 million will fund their four-year secondary education. The beneficiaries are drawn from all 47 counties. They comprise 104 students in boarding schools and 44 learners in day schools. Education Chief Administrative Secretary Sarah Ruto said the scholarships will contribute to children’s access to quality education and retention of learners in school as part of the universal education agenda. “This scholarship will rekindle hope among the beneficiaries who would otherwise miss secondary education opportunities due to their disadvantaged backgrounds,” Ruto said. She spoke during the award ceremony. The CAS challenged the scholars to take advantage of the award to secure a future that they desire through education. “Access to quality education will provide you with both academic and life skills to enable you to navigate the world of employment,” Ruto said. JKF Managing Director David Mwaniki said approximately 11,000 students have benefited from the scholarship program at a cost of over half a billion shillings. “The foundation is currently supporting 490 students in various secondary schools in Kenya,” he said. Stella Samboja, the foundation's Board chairperson, said that selection of the beneficiaries was done transparently to ensure that only deserving candidates received the sponsorship. The Jomo Kenyatta Foundation, whose core mandate is publishing, has been offering scholarships to needy but bright students since its inception in 1968. Its support complements the government's scholarship to 9,000 needy but bright learners who sat the 2021 KCPE exam.
