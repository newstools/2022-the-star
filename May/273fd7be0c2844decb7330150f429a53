The United States has warned American companies and individuals that doing business with state-owned and military-controlled firms in Sudan could risk their reputation because of the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. While some of these risks had been there before last October’s coup, the military takeover and actions since had made the things worse, the US Department of State said. “These risks arise from, among other things, recent actions undertaken by Sudan’s Sovereign Council and security forces under the military’s command, including and especially serious human rights abuse against protesters,” State Department Spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. Mr Price said the US government remained committed to supporting the Sudanese people’s aspiration for a civilian-led transition to an elected government. There have been frequent protests against the coup which have been put down with force - and it is estimated more than 90 people have died.
