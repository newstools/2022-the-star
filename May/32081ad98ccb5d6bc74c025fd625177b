EACC on Monday arrested and processed six Makueni MCAs for graft-related offences. The six will be charged before the Makueni Anti-Corruption Court on Tuesday, 31. They are accused of fraudulently claiming and receiving Sh175,018.50 each in full per diem for a trip to Dubai which had been privately sponsored. The private Dubai trip, which was fully sponsored by the then MP, Hon. Dr Patrick Musimba was undertaken from 14/04/2014 to 21/04/2014. Upon return, the MCAs fraudulently claimed and received Sh175,018.50 each as per diem, to which they were not entitled. The Six MCAs to be charged in court Tuesday are Timothy Sirei Maneno, Bernard Wambua, Cosmas Mutunga, Bensley Mwania, John Muli and Bernard Muthoka. They will be charged alongside the then Clerk of Assembly, Edward Libendi, who facilitated the illegal payments.
