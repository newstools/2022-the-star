Bandari's hopes for a maiden Kenyan Premier League title received a major boost following an emphatic 4-1 win over Vihiga Bullets at the Mbaraki Stadium on Saturday. William Wadri opened the floodgates in the 21st minute after being teed up by Keegan Ndemi for a clinical finish. Johanna Mwita then doubled the advantage from the spot after Abdalla Hassan was sent tumbling in the area. Kevin Kimani compensated for a penalty he had missed earlier in the game by grabbing the third goal before Darius Msagha completed the rout in stoppage time. The outcome leaves the dockers third on the log with 53 points, three adrift of leaders Kakamega Homeboyz and two adrift of second-placed Tusker.
