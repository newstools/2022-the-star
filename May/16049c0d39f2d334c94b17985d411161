Safina presidential aspirant Jimi Wanjigi has now turned to social media platforms to sell his manifesto to Kenyans ahead of the August 9 polls. He is the latest politician to leverage the digital space to reach out to the youthful population in the country. On Tuesday evening, Wanjigi will have a Twitter chat session where he will answer questions raised by Kenyans. "Tonight on joblessness and hopeless education. Let’s talk about what will be done by my Government when I become President in August 2022 #ChatWithJimi," he tweeted. He will also use the session to break down his manifesto which largely focuses on rebuilding the economy by creating jobs and offering quality education. The Twitter Chat comes a few days after he launched a WhatsApp chat platform that has so far seen over 1,600 Kenyans engage with the Safina party presidential aspirant. The WhatsApp platform can be accessed via https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=254704401303&text=ChatWithJimiWanjigi During the launch, Wanjigi promised to engage his supporters on a daily basis for one hour, between 8 pm and 9 pm. Wanjigi will respond to all questions asked within the first 72 hours of launching his WhatsApp platform. Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga has also leveraged the digital space for campaigns. He has so far held a digital campaign rally in which he sold his presidential bid to the masses. Many politicians are exploiting the digital space to reach out to the people and boost their chances as the election date knocks.
