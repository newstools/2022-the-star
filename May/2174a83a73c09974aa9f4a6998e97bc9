President Uhuru Kenyatta gave the public yet another rare peek into his differences with his deputy, William Ruto, on Labour Day. Uhuru made the case, quickly lapped up by his political Rottweilers, as to why Ruto abandoned his role as the second in command and has turned into a strident critic of the Jubilee administration. Politicians are notorious for making and breaking alliances so long as they believe the deal is past its sell by date. In a characteristic quick response, Ruto’s team accused the President of kicking the DP out of government and claimed Uhuru is a failed leader desperate to find a scapegoat. The election is only days away now and one of the matters that the long-suffering public is desperately looking forward to is a peaceful poll regardless of the winner. There is no doubt the tensions building up between Uhuru and Ruto must be brought under control. The public name-calling has the dangerous potential of providing a fertile ground for potential conflict in the lead to the polls. The duo and their allies must exercise utmost care and campaign fully aware that Kenya is bigger than any one individual. They must remember the style of former President Mwai Kibaki, whom they lavished with praise only five days ago, as a champion of peace and harmony. The danger of a Uhuru and Ruto verbal war is the effect it has on their die-hard followers. The verbal slights makes their positions harden and soon wicked power plots start to take shape in their evil minds. The church must use every power and influence in their disposal to urge for caution and call for peace between the boss and his deputy. Elections must never be as a matter of life and death.
