Kenya Pipeline booked a quarterfinal date with Cameron's FAP after humiliating Uganda's Ndenjje University 3-0 in the round of 16 at the ongoing Africa Women’s Volleyball Club Championship in Tunisia. Despite going toe to toe with Pipeline in the first set, the students lost 25-20. The second and third sets were reduced to mere training sessions for the oil merchants who managed 25-12 and 25-13 wins. This was Ndenjje's second loss in a span of three days to Kenyan sides after falling short against KCB on Tuesday. FAP moved to the last eight after outmuscling National Alcohol of Ethiopia in straight sets of 25-16, 25-15 and 25-13 but found the going tough against six-time champions Pipeline. Led by coach Paul Gitau, Pipeline will hope to end their 17-year title drought. The team last won the prestigious trophy in 2005 but bagged bronze in 2019. The other quarter-final will be a Kenyan affair as Kenya Prisons renew their rivalry with KCB. This is after the national league defending champions beat Ivory Coast's VCL 3-0(25-15, 25-18, 25-18). The bankers, on their part, dethroned Nigeria Customs Service by the same scoreline, in sets of 25-18, 25-16, 25-14. Prisons beat KCB in last season's playoffs to retain the league title. Both sides have injected fresh blood into their squads and whoever prevails, has a realistic chance of heading to the finals. Tunisia's de Carthage, who are also the defending champions, as well as AL Ahly, who are record holders stand in the way of Kenyans. Al Ahly are eight-time champions and the Egyptian club has broken many records back home. It is the most crowned team with 34 league titles and 30 Egyptian Cups.
