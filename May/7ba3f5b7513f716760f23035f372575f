Kandara MP Alice Wahome has told Deputy President William Ruto to pick a female running mate from Central region. Wahome said though other members of Kenya Kwanza alliance would want the position to go to their regions, Ruto should consider Central this time. She was speaking at Waitwa Secondary School on Tuesday during a tree planting exercise, where she said the move will ensure there is gender balance in leadership. “For now, I want to preach that Central region should be considered and especially a woman. I am best suited to fill in the position,” she said. The MP, has been a strong supporter of Ruto and is one of the founder members of UDA. She spoke hours after Ruto announced that he will make public his choice before Monday. The deadline for aspirants to name their running mates has been set for May 16 by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission . Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi are reportedly contending for the position. “The position will likely come from the Mt Kenya region although other members of the Kenya Kwanza alliance want it to,” Wahome said. Should she not get it, Wahome said it will not break her loyalty to the party and will defend her seat. “If I don’t get it, I will not break any bones. You don’t throw the baby away with the birth water. I will defend my seat and I am sure I'll win,” she said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
