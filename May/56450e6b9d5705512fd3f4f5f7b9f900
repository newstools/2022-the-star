Amber Heard has denied leaving faeces in her marital bed, insisting the idea of such a prank was "disgusting". Heard told the jury that the poop did not come from her and that Depp's dog, Boo, was to blame. Since he accidentally ate Depp's weed as a puppy, the teacup Yorkie, according to the 36-year-old actress, has had bowel issues.
