Bolognese sauce is an Italian dish made up of a meat-based tomato sauce served with spaghetti. The dish is best served up for dinner or lunch.  Preparation Step 1 Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and fry another minute. Step 2 Add the ground beef; fry until fully cooked and no pink shows at all in the meat (about 8 minutes). Add the oregano and tomato paste and mix with the meat. Step 3 Add the tomatoes, parsley, and bring to a boil. Season with the salt and pepper. Step 4 Reduce the heat to low, and cook for at least 15 minutes (you can cook longer for a deeper flavor). Step 5 In the meantime, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions and spice it up with salt. Step 6 Drain and serve topped with the beef sauce and cheese(optional)
