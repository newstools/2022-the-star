A court in Nairobi has termed the appointment of three Kemsa board members as unconstitutional. Justice Maureen Onyango ruled that their appointment by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe last year was done unconstitutionally. The three are Lawrence Wahome, Terry Ramadhani and Linton Kinyua and were appointed by CS Kagwe to be Kemsa board members. Ramadhani is now the newly appointed Kemsa boss as she officially assumed office early this week. However, the court has since dismissed an application by Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU)which had challenged a decision by Kemsa that allegedly declared staff redundant. Judge Onyango ruled that the application was speculative because none of its members had been declared redundant. KMPDU had sued Kemsa claiming it had threatened to undertake mass sacking of its more than 900 staff members and enlist new staff from Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) and National Youth Service (NYS).
