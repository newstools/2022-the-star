Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has outlined three reasons why he opted out of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition. Addressing the media in Karen on Tuesday, Kingi said Azimio's dealings are shrouded in deep secrecy. "My alliance had to opt-out because the legal process for PAA to be legally in Azimio could not be completed... We were frustrated by the flat refusal of Azimio to make available a copy for the agreement to enable us to table it in our NEC meeting as required in the constitution," he said. "Dealings in Azimio are shrouded in disturbing deep secrets and mistrust, consultation and decisions are made by a few and forced down the throats of the majority of the constituent parties," he added. According to him,  the above reasons made it difficult for them to pursue the PAA agenda. Kingi said apart from usual rhetorics in Azimio, there is no commitment for the Coastal people. "Presidential candidates promised heaven for Coastarians but this time we will not accept anything short. As a party, we were able to look for parties who will commit in writing," he said. "After a short and deep engagement with Kenya Kwanza, we signed an agreement with the alliance." Kingi is the defacto leader of the PAA party. Kingi's move comes a week after the party officials dismissed the allegations that he was about to join Deputy William Ruto's team. PAA party officials led by George Kithi, Kilifi Governor aspirant, and William Kingi, deputy governor and Mombasa governor candidate had confirmed that they were planning to exit Azimio but said they will not be joining any other coalition. The Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu had said PAA cannot ditch Azimio. On Monday morning,  Maendeleo Chap Chap party of Governor Alfred Mutua ditched the Azimio over frustration and being sidelined when it comes to matters of negotiations.
