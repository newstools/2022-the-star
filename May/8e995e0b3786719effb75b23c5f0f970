World record holder Simon Kibai successfully defended his men's 10, 000m title in the ongoing 24th Summer Deaflympics Games in Caxias Do Sul, Brazil on Monday. Kibai led compatriots Peter Toroitich and David Kipkogei to a podium sweep in that order. However, the official timing of the race was still being held by the deaf world governing body ICSD until all doping outcomes are unveiled. "I was out to win the race. I'm glad I did so. What I don't know is if I broke the record again," he said. Kibai said he is keen to win another gold medal in the 5,000m race. He also rescinded his earlier announcement that he would move to the marathon in the next championship, saying he will again do a double in the next competition before moving to the marathon. Toroitich was happy to have run his own race that granted him a silver. "I give our coach Samuel Kibet all the credit. He helped us to stay focused and inspired us ahead of the competition. When I came here, I dreamt of winning a medal and I’m happy I defended my title." Kipkogei said he had a nagging injury that forced him to struggle. "I'm glad I still finished within the medal bracket," he said. Another Kipkogei (Kelvin) threw 51.30m to win bronze in the men's javelin. "I followed all the instructions from the coach and I am glad I didn't disappoint in my first international event. I wanted to finish in the top three and I’m happy I achieved that target," Kipkogei said. Kipkogei, who was making his debut on the international stage added: “I started in primary school using wooden sticks and continued in secondary, where I used to be number one.” Kenyan Ambassador to Brazil, Lemarron Kaanto, led a capacity crowd to cheer the trio during the high octane race.
