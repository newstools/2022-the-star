More than 40 passengers escaped unhurt after the Guardian Angel bus they were travelling in burst into flames in the Buoye area on the Ahero-Kisumu road on Monday. The bus was heading to Nairobi from Busia when the incident occurred at about 5.45 am. The cause of the fire has not been established. Preliminary information indicates that the rare tire of the bus exploded. Kisumu county police commander Alphonce Kimathi said the bus was carrying 45 passengers and no casualties were reported. He said the officers and firefighters rushed to the scene to contain the situation. "There are no injuries and officers are on the ground," Kimathi said. By the time of going to press, the police boss noted that the fighters were still battling out the fire. Passengers who were evacuated safely were standing along the road in shock as they watch firefighters trying to put out the fire. Locals who milled around the scene were kept at a distance by the officers. Kimathi said they have launched an investigation into the incident.
