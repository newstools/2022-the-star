Nyeri Senate aspirant Kabando wa Kabando on Monday made good his promise of putting the portrait of Azimio presidential nominee Raila Odinga on his campaign posters. The former Mukurwei-ini MP placed Raila and his running mate Martha Karua on his poster and shared it on his Facebook shortly after Karua was unveiled the Azimio running mate on Monday On Tuesday last week during Karua’s visit to Nyeri, Kabando said if Karua will not be picked as Raila’s running mate, he would not associate himself with Azimio la Umoja. “If you are not named, I won’t waste my time. I will concentrate on my senatorial campaign. We must put conditions. Let us not bring jokes in leadership,” he told Karua. Kabando, without mentioning names, said some of those who were shortlisted to attend the Azimio running mate interviews were jokers. However, he at at the time said, if Karua is picked he, would work extra hard to campaign for Raila and even put his portrait on his campaign materials. Raila, he said, risked losing the small support he enjoyed in Mt Kenya region if he did not pick Karua. “But if you do not pick her, then there is no point going to the ballot because you will lose even the little support you have in the region," he said. He described Karua as courageous, a person of integrity and diligence who supported former President Mwai Kibaki. She also termed her an experienced politician, who has served as MP for 20 years but was not mentioned in graft cases. Central Kenya aspirants in Kenya Kwanza ticket are prominently putting portraits of Deputy President William Ruto on their campaign materials but those in Azimio have been avoiding Raila's image. Raila met area leaders and urged them to put his symbol and portrait the same way they did for President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013 and 2017 campaigns. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
