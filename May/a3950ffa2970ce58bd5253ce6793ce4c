The send-off of former President Mwai Kibaki on Saturday saw a dramatic incident pop up after a daring woman stormed to the podium in a bid to reach out to Deputy President William Ruto. Ruto had concluded his speech and was about to recognise the leaders present when the unidentified woman caught the security guards unaware. She left her seat and went running to the podium cheering the DP as she headed in the direction where the second in command was addressing from. Security personnel however responded swiftly, grabbed her and whisked her away in a twinkle of an eye. The DP went on with the speech ostensibly downplaying the incident. On Friday, Mwai Kibaki's state funeral held at Nyayo National Stadium witnessed a similar incident. A man identified as Allan Makana interrupted Archbishop Anthony Muheria who was about to usher in President Uhuru Kenyatta to welcome foreign dignitaries and deliver his speech. The man, who had earlier claimed to be Kibaki's grandson approached Archbishop Muheria and requested an opportunity to address Kenyans. The Archbishop emerged as a hero among Kenyans after he handled him calmly and lovingly walked him out of the podium. “He is a son of our nation who is emotional at the loss of a President, treat him well,” the Archbishop said before proceeding with the mass. Speaking about the incident in Othaya, Muheria reiterated the need to have mercy on Allan Makana. "It is an incident that happened and we do not foresee these things but we handle them as the holy spirit guides us at the moment. I think it was a young man who was a bit emotional and I really hope that he is looked upon with mercy and someone attends to him," he said.
