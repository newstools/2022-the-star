Zetech University Titans coach Job Munene is eyeing a play-off spot in their Kenya National Basketball League (KNBL) debut. The students, who are the Division One winners, open their campaign in the top tier against former national champions Ulinzi Warriors on June 4. Munene noted that for the campus side to win their opener against the soldiers, they must be accurate on their shots and remain disciplined throughout. "We will definitely play well against them. It will be a good game for us. There is no one who goes to battle to lose, we will be ready for them." Munene said. He went on, "We will not give them easy shots and send them to the line too much as they are good shooters." "As long as we play as a team, we will be good. What will be bad is if we go out there and start playing individually." Munene is aware he is coming against a side that lost their title to Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) last month and is hungry for success. "We know we are coming up against a big team out to regain their glory. We respect their seniority, but we have a youthful advantage over them." Munene revealed he lost one of his key players in James Marial to Africa Nazarene University but retained Joseph Gitau, who is last year's top scorer. "I lost Marial but fortunately I still have Gitau and I have also made some new signings that will help us going forward." The new players in his stable are- Victor Okoth (Little Prince), Rodney Sandé (Dagoretti High) and Dominic Babu (Mbooni). A total of 20 matches are on the card in all categories, according to the fixtures released by (KBF) competitions secretary Joseph Amoko.
