A Nairobi court on Monday heard that Jowie Irungu’s phone number was traced at Denis Pritt Road where businesswoman Monica Kimani resided on the night she was murdered. Jowie is the first accused in the murder trial of Monica, and is charged alongside Jacque Maribe. Monica’s body was found at her Lamuria Gardens apartment which is located on Kitale Lane off Denis Pritt road in Kilimani, Nairobi. Jonathan Limo, an officer from DCI and seconded to Safaricom law enforcement, on Monday told Justice Grace Nzioka he received a request letter from DCI requiring data records of Jowie, Maribe and two lines belonging to Monica. He was to extract details of their numbers from September 1, 2018 to September 30 in the same year. He is the 33rd witness in the case. He said Jowie’s number was traced at Denis Pritt on September 19 from 16.33hrs to 21.03 hrs. At 21.9hrs it was located in Kileleshwa. Still on the same day, at around 23.52hrs, the phone was located at DOD headquarters and four minutes later, it was traced at Nairobi Gospel of God. Maribe’s number was traced at Denis Pritt Road on September 19 from 5:28 to 9.45pm. The witness told the court that from the data records, Monica’s line was in communication with that of Jowie on September 1. And at 9.32pm, Monica’s number was located in Kileleshwa. At exactly 11:06pm the phone could no longer be traced. Witnesses said the last call was an outgoing call made by Monica at 9.32pm. There was also no communication on Yassir Mohammed's phone from September 18 to 20, 2018. Yassir is said to be Monica's boyfriend. The case proceeds today.   -Edited by SKanyara
