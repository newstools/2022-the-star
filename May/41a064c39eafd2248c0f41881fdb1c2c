Azimio presidential running mate and Narc Party leader Martha Karua on Friday stormed Nyeri County for campaigns. Karua made campaign stops at Othaya, Karatina, Giakanja and Nyeri town. Karua promised to educate children from poor families and provide Sh6,000 per month to all poor families for their upkeep if Raila Odinga becomes president. "We will push out corrupt leaders to free the funds they are wasting so they can be used to provide for you," she added. With her were Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, Information and Communication CS Joe Muchru and other Azimio leaders.
