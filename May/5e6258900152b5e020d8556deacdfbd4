Daniel Kindiki, the father of Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki, has said he is optimistic that his son will be named as Ruto's running mate. In an interview on KTN news on Saturday, he said that Kindiki has always had the urge to serve the country on a higher rank and he felt this was the right time as his leadership skills have proven he is capable. Upon being asked how he felt about him being chosen as a running mate, he said he knows that he is qualified and has what it takes to lead the country on that level. "I believe in him, and since this is what he has always wanted, I'm confident he will be chosen," he said. He further described Kindiki as an active child from when he was in primary school. "One day, I heard that he had been chosen as the secretary for the student leadership organisation at Moi University, I was happy because I knew he loved leadership and that is where his journey into politics started," he said. David says that Kindiki has always wanted to be a leader as he felt the urge to help where he could and was chosen by elders when he was still young to lead projects and his fellow youth. He hilariously narrates how they one day saw him on TV at Hague with DP Ruto, and they definitely knew that that was his path. "He also told us that he does not want to become a senator again as his capabilities were beyond the senate seat," he said. Ruto is expected to unveil his running mate on Saturday. Multiple sources on Friday confirmed to the Star that Ruto had settled on the soft-spoken former university professor to deputise him. Those aware of the plans to unveil the DP's deputy said Ruto was ready to live up to his promise to forward the name of his running mate to the electoral commission before Monday.
