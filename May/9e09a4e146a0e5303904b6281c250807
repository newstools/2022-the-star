The Peoples Empowerment Party wants the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission to assure small political parties of fairness and credibility in the general election. Party leader Stephen Mwakesi said they should be accorded equal assistance like their bigger competitors for a fair and credible election. Mwakesi said all parties play a key role in shaping Kenya’s democracy. “All political parties are important and should therefore be assisted where necessary. IEBC should exercise fairness and guarantee Kenyans a fair and credible poll,” he said. Mwakesi, who is vying for the Taita Taveta governor seat, said the party will not enter into a pre-election coalition with other parties. He said a special team had been constituted to lead campaigns in the coastal region to clinch seats. “Our party is committed to winning as many seats as possible. We will campaign independently,” the public policy analyst said. He spoke on Monday during the issuance of party tickets and the launch of the party’s Coast region campaign trail at Mwatate in Taita Taveta. Mwakesi said the party will offer a third force in the region and targets to scoop a majority of ward rep seats in Taita Taveta. The party has lined up some 16 MCA aspirants out of 20 wards in the county. Other notable aspirants flying the party ticket are former Agriculture executive Ben Mghana who is seeking Mwatate MP seat and Woman Representative aspirant Annah Kina. Watson Simiyu, the party chairman said the party will field candidates in at least 33 counties including Coast, Western and North Eastern among other regions. “Plans are underway to launch campaigns in other regions where we command a massive following,” Simiyu said. He said the party is keen on signing a post-election pact with the ruling party after the polls. A pre-election coalition, Simiyu said, would limit the party’s freedom in contesting in all counties due to zoning.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
