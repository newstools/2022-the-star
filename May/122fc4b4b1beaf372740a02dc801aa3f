Kenya's campaign got off to a torrid start at the ongoing IBA Women's World Championship in Istanbul, Turkey with  Lorna Kusa crushing to Kazakhistani Khalzova Valentine in the lightweight division. Kusa's exit is considered a big blow to the country, given she had been touted as a strong contender due to her admirable credentials. She is one of the seasoned pugilists in the country, having competed at the 2010 world championship in Barbados, Indian open 2018, Gold coast Commonwealth games in Australia and the 2019 Africa games in Rabat Morocco. She headed into the competition high on confidence after bagging silver at the Africa Zone 3 Boxing Championship in Kinshasa. The tournament was officially opened in Istanbul on Monday by IBA President Umar Kremlev, marking the start of two weeks of ground-breaking competition. “Women boxers have demonstrated by their skill, by their strength and by their determination that they have so much to offer our sport. And boxing has much to offer women all around the world,”  Kremlev said. “IBA has been working hard to provide opportunities for women and to promote them, both inside and outside the ring. And I am now looking forward to seeing new boxing legends to be born in the next 2 weeks.” A record 310 athletes representing 73 National Federations will be battling for honours in 12 weight categories.
