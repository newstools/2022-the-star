Plans have been mooted to connect Kitui town and Wote through a 86-km road through Thwake dam that will reduce the current distance by nearly 40km. Transport Principal Secretary Mwangi Maringa and Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu launched the commissioning of the tarmacking of the Wikililye-Wote Road last last Friday. The project will cost of Sh2.3 billion. One has to currently cover a distance of 177km while travelling between Kitui town and Wote town in Makueni county. Mwangi said the completed tarmacking 714km of road in Ukambani region while another 1,200km was were under construction, which cumulatively cost the exchequer Sh60 billion. He said incessant pressure from Ngilu had seen the launch of the road directly connecting Kitui and Makueni counties fast tracked. Ngilu said once the road was completed in two years, business will flourish between Kitui and Makueni. She urged residents to tap on the project’s value chain to better their livelihoods. The governor further said since the Jubilee government had done a lot for Ukambani people in terms of road network, it would be proper for residents to back Azimio flagbearer, Raila Odinga, as the next president. The governor said Raila had already made a commitment that he would follow in the footsteps of President Uhuru Kenyatta and also complete any projects that the latter will have left unfinished. Others present during the commissioning were KenHA director general Kung'u Ndung'u and Kitui Trade executive Esther Kilonzi.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
