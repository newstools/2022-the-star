Patients' safety is at risk of serious medical errors because future doctors are poorly trained and often get accredited without knowledge of operational basics. They might also end up making significant medical errors while conducting surgeries on patients. This is according to a report titled 'Characterising Kenyan hospitals’ suitability for medical officer internship training'. The report found that half of hospitals that accept medical interns are poorly equipped and many future doctors finish the one-year training without learning some basic procedures.
