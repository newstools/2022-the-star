A new deputy director of the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been named in changes announced by the director George Kinoti. The head of the Anti-Narcotics Unit Hamis Masa was promoted to take over as the deputy DCI in the changes announced Thursday. This follows the retirement of Joseph Ashmalla from the service after attaining mandatory age. In the changes, the head of DCI at the Kenya Airports Police Unit (KAPU) Bernard Nyakwaka was moved to the Central region and named the Regional Criminal Investigations Officer (RCIO) swapping positions with Geoffrey Kathurima. The new director of personnel at the DCI headquarters will be Gideon Kibunja. Kibunja took over from Dr. Wanderi Mwangi who was moved to Railways and named the Criminal Investigations Officer (CCIO). The new director of training will be outgoing Railway CCIO John Kamau while Samuel Kobina was moved from DCI academy, and named the head of DCI Langata sub-county. Kinoti termed the changes normal aimed at enhancing operations in the service. Masa is a long-serving director of ANU and his appointment is seen as a reward for his work. The changes come at a time when dozens of senior police officers are mumbling over their pending promotions. The promotions are lying at the desks of the National Police Service Commission and Inspector General of police. This has affected the working morale of the officers and general command. Other sources said the pending promotions need to be taken to the president for approval, which is yet to happen for unknown reasons. For instance, regional commanders for Rift Valley, North Eastern, and Central are donning insignia meant for their juniors which is affecting command in general.
