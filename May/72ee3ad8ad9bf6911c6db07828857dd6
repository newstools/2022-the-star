After Depp's legal team presented their last witness during the ongoing trail, and rested, Heard's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case, Variety reports. They argued that Depp's legal team had failed to provide enough evidence to support their case. Judge Penney Azcarate denied the motion, leaving it to the jury to reach a verdict once all evidence and arguments have been presented. Depp's evidence has now been presented, and Heard's attorneys will have the opportunity to give their defence from Wednesday.
