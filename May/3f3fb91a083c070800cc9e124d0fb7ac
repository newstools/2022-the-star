Azimio la Umoja flagbearer Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua on Tuesday held a meeting with the European Business Council. Speaking at the meeting, Raila promised to make it easier for start-up businesses and foreign investors to trade in Kenya if he is elected president. "My administration will implement measures that will make it easier for businesses to thrive within and without our borders." Karua said the Azimio administration will focus on the gap that exists between political discourse that attracts foreign investments by addressing issues of taxation, immigration, customs and administration delays.
