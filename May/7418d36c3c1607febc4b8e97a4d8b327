WhatsApp is now working to generate rich link previews when sharing a link to the text status update. The update will help both sender and receiver to check the previews before opening or reading the message entirely. Currently, the testing has been done on the iOS platform but could also be rolled out to Android users as well. If you share a URL as a status update on WhatsApp, it does not generate a link preview, it appears as plain text. The user then taps on the link to head to the website. However, the application plans to change that with the future update. The preview link will likely include an image from the target website, the title, the meta description and the URL.
