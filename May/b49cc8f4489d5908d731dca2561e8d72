ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has said his ODM counterpart Raila Odinga will be shocked by the number of votes he will get from the Western region in the August polls. Mudavadi on Thursday claimed Raila has been the greatest beneficiary of his hard work and sweat alongside Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula. The ANC leader said Raila enjoyed massive votes from the Western region because of him and Wetangula. “We had to sacrifice our political ambitions for him but he is not appreciative. It's time we work for someone else who can see our work, our efforts as well,” Mudavadi said. The former vice president was speaking to KTN News where he said they will do all it takes to ensure they deliver the presidency to Kenya Kwanza candidate William Ruto. He scoffed at those imagining that the Western region is the political bastion of Raila saying they will be in for a rude shock. Mudavadi said they sealed a political pact with Ruto because of their common goal of reviving the ailing economy. “We want an economy that works for all Kenyans and doesn’t discriminate its citizens at any cost,” Mudavadi said. “Economy that will allow an equal purchasing power according to their demands. DP Ruto seeks for an economy that is equal for all people without looking at the rich and poor." Mudavadi dismissed claims that Ruto is part of the Jubilee government's failures saying the DP was elbowed out of his mandate. He said they are currently working on a bill that will establish who was in charge of  Kenya's huge debts, whether the due procedure was followed and if the funds were properly used. “Our MP Sakwa Bunyasi is currently working on the bill and is already on second reading in parliament. The Bills seeks transparency and accountability on Kenya’s public debts,” he said. Mudavadi said if that bill goes through, they will be able to audit all public debts.
