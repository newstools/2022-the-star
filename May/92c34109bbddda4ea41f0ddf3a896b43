UDA chairman Johnson Muthama has denied plans to ditch his party and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance for the Azimio coalition party. In a statement, the former Machakos senator said he is solidly behind Deputy President William Ruto's presidential bid. "I'm still the chairman of UDA Kenya, the biggest and most vibrant political party in Kenya. That is the inexorable truth," he said in the press statement. "I have and will remain focused, faithful and true to UDA Kenya's cause until we form the next government under Dr. William Ruto. Mezeni wembe wapinani wetu." He faulted the Azimio coalition for the lies about his departure from the UDA party. "Azimio coalition is imprisoned in a gridlock of lies and keep on blurring the lines between facts and fables expecting us in UDA Kenya to buy their debilitating and fake narrative of defections until they eventually realise I Johnson Nduya Muthama is going nowhere." His clarification comes in the wake of reports that a number of leaders are set to quit the Kenya Kwanza Alliance for Azimio.
