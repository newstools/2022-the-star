Strathmore Gladiators vice-captain, Brian Nyabuto, will miss Friday's match against United States International University's Mashujaa at the Dashmesh Hockey Stadium in Nairobi. The maverick forward is expected to be out of action for at least one week after sustaining an ankle injury in their 3-2 loss to Kenya Police in the Gold Cup club invitational hockey tournament on Thursday. Nyabuto has been an ever-present member of the Meshack Senge-tutored side, scoring three goals in four matches thus far. "The ankle is painful but I'll have to wait for the examination from the physio. It is unfortunate I won't be available against Mashujaa, considering this is a varsity derby that I always enjoy playing but I hope to be back soon," Nyabuto pointed out. "I'm optimistic to return to training in a week's time. This is the first time I have hurt my ankle and my injury record is clean," the national under-21 player said. Any extended period on the treatment table for the 21-year-old would be a big blow for Strathmore whose next league assignment will be on May 28 against Western Jaguars in Kakamega. Gladiators have picked one win, drawn once and lost twice in the week-long tournament. Their resurgence this season leaves them second in the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League standings where they have 10 points.
