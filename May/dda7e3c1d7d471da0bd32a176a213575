Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says title rivals Manchester City are "too good" not to bounce back from their dramatic midweek Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. City lost a two-goal lead to lose 3-1 to Real Madrid in the second-leg semi final with just minutes to go in the Bernabeu. City looked certain to go through when Riyad Mahrez put them 1-0 up and 5-3 ahead on aggregate. However, Rodrygo who came on as a substitute, scored an incredible late double, his goals in the 90th and 91st minutes sending the tie to extra time. As City were still reeling, Karim Benzema landed the knock-out blow after he earned and then converted a spot-kick to snatch a 6-5 win on aggregate to send Real Madrid to the finals.
