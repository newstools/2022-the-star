Azimio la Umoja one Kenya Presidential aspirant Raila  Odinga will be charming his way back to Trans Nzoia County today to attend the burial of the wife of former minister Burudi Nabwera. According to Defense Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, the former Premier is expected to use the occasion to drum up support for his presidential bid in the rich agricultural zone. Wamalwa hinted that the Azimio leader’s second day visit in the County will tilt votes not only in his favor but for all candidates campaigning on the Coalition’s  ticket. "Yesterday’s visit by Baba has  helped change the mentality that this is an area reserved for Kenya Kwanza. It is different this time, we are set to go", he said. Raila will be seeking to erode the probable gains made by Deputy President William Ruto and his Kenya Kwanza brigade which has been in Trans Nzoia twice.
