Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has apologised to police officers in the country following the uproar his remarks generated. In a statement on Wednesday, Malala said he holds the police service in high esteem adding his sentiments are regrettable. "My attention has been drawn to a video circulating on social media about my utterances toward the Police. I wish to categorically state that my remarks were taken totally out of context," he wrote on Facebook. "Their importance to us cannot be underscored. It is in light of this that I wish to withdraw my remarks and apologise to our disciplined forces for the discomfort my remarks may have caused." Video of Malala saying police officers do not need education to discharge their mandate went viral on social media sparking varied reactions. The senator, who is eyeing the Kakamega Governor seat, said police work only entails holding guns. "Si kazi ya polisi nikushika tuu bundiki?" Malala said. Loosely translated to: "Is police work not about just holding a gun?". Malala was speaking in Kakamega on Tuesday during a Kenya Kwanza rally. He said those who have passed exams should be allowed to pursue education at universities and colleges adding those who dropped out of school should be recruited to the police service. "Provided they got two arms and legs, let them join the police service. A police service job only entails handling firearms, which doesn't need training. Let those who have passed their examinations go to universities as those who failed and dropped out join the police service," he said. The National Police Service also weighed in on the matter and said they were "disappointed" with the Senator's remarks.
