Azimio Senate aspirant Edwin Sifuna has called for a mechanism to manage the number of aspirants per elective seat. The ODM Secretary-General called on the need to sieve candidates to reduce on the number of contesters for particular seats saying some aspirants are abusing the constitutional right. Sifuna noted that managing what happens at the polling stations becomes hectic when many candidates are cleared to the ballot and insist on having their agents at each station. He spoke after it emerged that the Nairobi Senate seat alone has attracted 34 aspirants and so far IEBC had cleared eight aspirants by Tuesday midday. “If you clear 30 candidates and they insist on having at least two agents per polling station, it becomes hectic and might compromise the conduct of elections,” Sifuna said. “We must have a mechanism to ensure that people who end up on the ballot are serious candidates and not just people abusing the right.” The ODM Secretary-General was speaking at Kasarani Stadium after he was cleared to contest the Senate seat in the August 9 General Election. He was accompanied by a host of Azimio affiliate party officials from Nairobi and hundreds of supporters. Sifuna will now battle it out with UDA’s Margaret Wanjiru who was also cleared on Monday. He expressed confidence in winning the seat challenging his rivals to embrace peaceful and issue based campaigns. “We want a peaceful campaigns. I am not running against any candidate but the problems facing Nairobi residents.”
