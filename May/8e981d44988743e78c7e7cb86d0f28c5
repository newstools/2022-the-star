MP Tim Wanyonyi will defend his Westlands seat following consultations with ODM, the party has announced Speaking on Sunday, Suna East MP Junet Mohammed said Wanyonyi had the intentions of running but after negotiations, it was decided that he defends his seat. “But there was also our candidate Michale Gumo who participated in nomination on ODM ticket. The ODM party has consulted and Gumo has accepted to step down in favour of Wanyonyi,” he said. He said Wanyonyi will be the ODM candidate in Westlands ahead of the general elections. “Those who wanted a big fallout just know that we have sorted all this out and we will make sure that this seat will be maintained by ODM,” he said. Wanyonyi officially kicked off campaigns to retain his seat days after he agreed to abandon his first stab at the Nairobi Governor’s seat. It was while addressing ODM grassroots leaders in Westlands Constituency on Sunday, May 1, when the second term legislator revealed why he dropped his bid to be the next governor of the City-County of Nairobi. Tim said he agreed not to run for the top county seat because his party leader Raila Odinga had been cleared to run for President under the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance. Under the agreement, he said, it had been decided that ODM takes the Presidency while the Jubilee Party of President Uhuru Kenyatta takes the Nairobi Governor’s seat.
