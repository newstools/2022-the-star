Juma Nyasi, an ex-convict who scored 401 marks in his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education will finally join secondary school. The 28-year-old received a full secondary school scholarship from the Taita Taveta County government after he was unable to raise the amount to join the school. Nyasi was freed from Manyani Maximum Security Prison last month after his life sentence in a sexual assault case was quashed by the High Court. The Voi High Court acquitted him of the charges after new evidence vindicated him from the accusations levelled against him. He will now join Ikutha Boys Secondary School based in Kitui County. "I had no hope of joining secondary school but I thank God that I have been selected to get the scholarship. I will join the school next week," he said. He was the best student among inmates across the country. Nyasi further explained that his dream of becoming an engineer will not go to waste now that he has joined secondary school. "I am so happy that my dream of becoming an engineer will come to pass," he said. Nyasi is among hundreds of bright students who are set to benefit from an Sh11 million county scholarship programme for their secondary education. According to Nyasi, this was the second time that he was sitting the KCPE exams after dropping out of secondary school, years before, due to lack of fees. "I sat the KCPE exams at Kale Primary School in 2009 but dropped out of secondary school in 2011 after my sponsor passed on," he stated.
