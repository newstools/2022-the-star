The interwebs are crazy. And Safaricom is there to respond to the craziness in kind. One user of the Telecommunication services reached out to the online customer care team on Facebook and asked for help. Ray Rash asked for help - ever so politely - using sheng. Actually, using the even more corrupted version of sheng called Shembeteng. For those who don't understand Shembeteng, Ray was asking, "Hi Safaricom, niko na shida kidogo. Mtu akitaka kureplace simcard hueda wapi? (Hi Safaricom, I have a small issue. Where can I go to replace my sim card?)" Safaricom responded in fluent Shembeteng, here is a translation, "Enda duka yoyote yetu na ID yako, Ray. ^MZ. (Go to any of our shots with your ID, Ray.)" Here are some reactions from the ever undefeated people of the internet. Laroh Tonui Cholyo: Safaricom nakulombotov leo tu.
