Four people were injured when gunmen sprayed a Quick Shuttle with bullets just past the KWS camp in Kainuk, Turkana county. The injured included the driver of the matatu and three passengers. They were en route to Lodwar from Kitale on Labour Day morning when their vehicle was attacked by bandits. The driver told police he slowed down after being stopped by about eight gunmen. One of them opened fire, injuring the victims. They robbed the passengers of their belongings before fleeing the scene. The driver said he was unable to proceed and drove back about 15 kilometres for medical attention at Kainuk health Centre A critically injured woman was rushed to Kapenguria for treatment of serious bullet injuries. Police said the attackers escaped soon after the attack. They said they made no arrests or recovery of stolen property. The attack on Sunday is the second such attack in the same area in three months, despite police operations. Rift Valley police boss Tom Odero said they had sent more personnel to pursue the bandits. He said the gang is believed to have escaped to an unknown destination but a hunt was ongoing. The road network in the expansive area is good but the bandits use guns to carry out their mission. Last month, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said special units have been deployed to the area and other counties affected by such attacks to pursue the gangs. “The situation is aggravated by the politics of expansionism, drought, rough and vast terrain and proliferation of arms sneaked in through porous borders. "Political instability and troubles in neighbouring countries also make it easy to access weapons,” he said. The CS said perpetuation of retrogressive practices such as cattle rustling and moranism worsens the conflict. (Edited by V. Graham)
