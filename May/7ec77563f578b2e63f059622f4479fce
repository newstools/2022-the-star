Deputy President William Ruto has called on Kenyan churches to openly declare who they support ahead of the August elections. Speaking during the Evangelical Alliance of Kenya National Convention on Wednesday, at the Nairobi Baptist Church in Nairobi, the DP said that the church must step forward and play an active role in politics. “The church can no longer afford to be neutral but place itself at the centre of our politics to fashion a conversation towards Kenya We Want; an inclusive Kenya of equal opportunities for all,” Ruto said. Ruto said that his Kenya Kwanza Alliance team will ensure that Kenya becomes a country where everyone will have a chance to work, and put food on the table. “That is the Kenya that Kenya Kwanza is also modelling through its Bottom-Up Economic Model.” This comes days after a section of indigenous church leaders endorsed Ruto for the presidency. Under the auspices of the Federation of Evangelical and Indigenous Churches of Kenya (FEICCK), the 17 bishops also said Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is the best bet to deputise the Deputy President. "We shall go to our churches and persuade our people to elect H.E William Ruto as the fifth President of the Republic of Kenya," said Bishop Samuel Njiri, chairman of the Federation. FEICCK said their decision is based on the DP's track record and his Christian faith. "As we all know, the IEBC has given Presidential candidates the May 16 deadline to submit names of their running mates. This is equally important to us. In this regard, we are making a passionate appeal to our Presidential candidate to nominate a woman for running mate."
