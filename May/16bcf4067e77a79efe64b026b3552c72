Reports that Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala might be locked out of the Kakamega Governor race because of a lack of requisite education have forced the leader to share copies of his education papers on social media. The senator in a bid to shut down propagandists and assure his supporters of his candidature posted his KCSE and University certificates. He at the same time divulged that the papers had been given a clean bill of health by the Commission for University Education. He said the commission has now directed the IEBC to clear him to vie. "The Commission for University Education (CUE) has duly certified and recognized my academic credentials and henceforth advised the IEBC to clear me to contest in the August 2022 gubernatorial election, Kakamega county," the Senator wrote on Facebook. "Those who cherish propaganda, feel ashamed. Attached are the true copies of my academic accolades." The senator is seeking the Governor's seat on an ANC party ticket. He has earned the support of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance as there is no other candidate from all parties in the coalition apart from him. Malala is facing competition from ODM's Fernandes Barasa who has now teamed up with Lugari MP Ayub Savula to dwarf his ambitions.
