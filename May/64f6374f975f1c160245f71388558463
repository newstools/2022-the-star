Fruit salads are also commonly known by many as pudding. Salads are healthy and very nutritious. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a large bowl combine the strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, pineapple, and bananas. Step 2 Add the vanilla and mint and toss to coat. Step 3 Serve the salad immediately, it is best enjoyed the day it is made. The bananas will have a black coating if you store the salad in the fridge, so if you are not serving immediately, best put them aside.
