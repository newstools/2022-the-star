The Facebook feature that tracks your real-time location will be soon unavailable, from May 31st. Meta announced that the feature that tracks nearby friends, weather alerts, location history, and background location will be unavailable due to low usage. The company also said any previously stored data will be wiped out on August 1st. However, Facebook confirmed with the Verge, that it will continue to collect users’ location information for other experiences across its platform as described by its Data Policy. The nearby friend’s feature was introduced by the company back in 2014. In 2019 it started letting users turn off background location tracking following a report that revealed Facebook tracked users’ locations if they made a “credible” threat. Although applications like snapchat have thrived using this feature from 2019, Meta may be struggling. The app’s Snap Map feature lets users see their friends’ locations, as well as view Snaps users submit to the Map from all over the world. Facebook has also been shuttering other services that weren’t gaining enough traction including, recently, its audio products It has advised its users to update their settings before May 31st because, after this, they will not be able to view or delete their existing location history. You can view, download, or delete any location data the platform saved within the Settings and Privacy menu. Otherwise, your existing location history information will be automatically deleted.
