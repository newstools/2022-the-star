Kenya Urban Roads Authority has warned Kenyans against land fraudsters purporting to own lands owned by the Authority at City Cabanas along Mombasa Road. In a statement on Wednesday, KURA Director-General Silas Kinoti said the authority had acquired some two parcels of land situated between the Nairobi Expressway offices and Ramtons building, opposite City Cabanas along Mombasa Road. "We acquired through the compulsory acquisition process the two land parcels known as registration numbers L.R. No 209/14694/1 and L.R. No. 209/14694/2," he said. Kinoti advised the public not to make payments or to engage with any entities claiming that they own the land. "It has come to our attention that various individuals and entities are fraudulently asserting ownership and/or are attempting unlawfully to claim ownership of the said land," Kinoti said. "Take further notice that any person (s) purchasing the said portion or parcels of land as aforesaid shall do so at their own risk," Kinoti said. He also said KURA shall not honour the agreements, contracts or arrangements entered into with persons purporting to have authority to transact on the said parcel of land. He said the land was acquired from strategic industries in 2004 for the sole purpose of completing the construction of the City Cabanas interchange. KURA is a state agency established under the Roads Act 2007 to manage, develop, rehabilitate and maintain the national urban road network.
