Education CS George Magoha has clarified the issue of the junior Secondary schools under CBC. The CS said that both junior secondary will have both boarding and day schools. "All the existing boarding and day secondary schools will admit learners transiting from Grade 6 to Grade 7 under CBC," Magoha said. The CS said that the transition will be based on the curriculum that will be provided by the ministry. Magoha added that his ministry has identified 1,500  primary schools that will host the junior secondary schools, which have adequate learning and teaching facilities. "All the existing boarding and day secondary schools will admit learners transiting to junior secondary,"Magoha said. Further, the education ministry has consulted private schools to set up stand alone junior secondary schools. This, Magoha said will provide chances for learners to fully transition to secondary school. "Implementation of CBC and transition from primary school is based on recommendations of the taskforce appointed," he said. He added that the implementation of CBC and transition from primary to junior secondary school and later senior secondary school is based on the recommendations of the Taskforce that was formed in 2019. KICD said they already created curriculum designs from PP1 to grade seven. KICD is in the process of developing more course materials ahead of the full rollout. Teachers' training on CBC is ongoing and is set to be completed by the end of this week. Over 60,000 teachers in both public and private secondary schools are currently undergoing training. A total of 229,000 teachers have, so far, been trained by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) across the forty-seven counties.
