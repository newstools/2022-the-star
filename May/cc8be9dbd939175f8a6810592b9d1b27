Zetech Sparks coach Benard Kitolo expects fireworks at Mumias Sports complex this weekend and is unwilling to hand Vihiga the Kenya Women's Premier League title. Vihiga need to beat Sparks to be crowned champions for a fourth time in five years with four games to spare. Rejuvenated Sparks are in blistering form, having won their last four matches including Gaspo and Thika Queens' encounters. Their resurgence is down to proper recruitment in the mid-season transfer window which offered fresh breath to the squad. Kitolo believes his charges have what it takes to match their accomplished opponents as the students hope to carry on with the momentum. Vihiga remain unbeaten after 17 matches but tactical genius Kitolo said the pressure is on Vihiga. Playing in front of their fans and maintaining the unbeaten run will likely destabilise Vihiga players, according to Kitolo. "Vihiga have more pressure than us. They have to keep their record intact. Playing at home is an advantage to them but comes with added pressure," Kitolo reckons. "We are underdogs but we have to prove that the squad has developed. We have a plan for them but I can't reveal my strategy. Vihiga could be in for a rude shock if they think they will beat us. We haven't handed a team the title in the past and we are not ready to do that this time," bullish Kitolo categorically explained. Zetech beat Kangemi Ladies 1-0 on Saturday to move to fifth in the WPL standings. Leaders Vihiga, who beat Gaspo 2-0, opened a 13-point gap against second-placed Ulinzi following their scoreless draw against Thika. Despite winning their matches, Kisumu All-Starlets and Kayole remain in the relegation dogfight with 13 points.  They are placed 10th and 11th respectively in the 12-team WPL. Wadadia and Bunyore Starlets are not out of the woods yet and any slip-ups would pull them back to the relegation mix.
