KCB has appointed Paul Russo as the Group CEO effective May 25, as long serving chief Joshua Oigara leaves the regional lender. "The appointment follows a competitively run selection process that kicked off in March 2022," Group chairman Andrew Kairu said in an announcement on Tuesday. Russo brings a wealth of experience in banking, operational management, people management, strategy and a sharp business acumen, the regional lender said. An insider, Russo's most recent role in the Group has been that of managing director at National Bank of Kenya, and the KCB Group regional business director. He has over 20 years of work experience spanning executive and key roles including as Group HR director. He holds an MBA from Strathmore University Business School and a Bachelor of Business Management from Moi University. He also holds a Senior Executive Program for Africa Certificate from Harvard Business School and a Higher Diploma in Human Resource Management from the Institute of Human Resources (Kenya). "The board congratulates Paul for the appointment  and is confident that he will ably steer the Group's future growth ambitions," Kairu said. Oigara is leaving the Group about six months to the end of his contract. He took over leadership in January 2013. He has led the lender for nearly a decade, driving the growth of the Group business and expansion into the region. "He has been instrumental in deepening financial inclusion and social impact across East Africa," the board chairman, Kairu, said.
