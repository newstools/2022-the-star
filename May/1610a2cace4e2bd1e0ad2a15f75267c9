The Without Me singer, who uses both she/her and they/them pronouns, told fans on TikTok that her label, Astralwerks is allegedly blocking the release of their new song for marketing reasons. "Basically, I have a song that I love that I want to release ASAP, but my record label won't let me." reads the text in the video. "I've been in this industry for eight years and I've sold over 165 million records and my record company is saying I can't release (the song) unless they can fake a viral moment on TikTok".
