Urban Afro-pop singer Iyanii is among the artistes who are performing on Wednesday during this year's Madaraka Day celebrations. Speaking to Word Is, the 'Pombe' hitmaker said this is a dream come true. "As a youth who does music as a full-time job, getting a chance to perform for our nation humbles me," he said. The Permanent Presidential Music Commission (PPMC) last Friday announced that the preparations for the Madaraka Day Celebrations are ongoing. Iyanii said he was amazed at how the commission is thorough in putting together the entertainment programme. He thanked Kenyans for the great reception of his music. Other artistes billed to perform on the day include Femi One, Trio Mio, Mutulani Kasheshe of Kungulu Kwangala Fame. This year's Madaraka Day celebrations will be held at Uhuru Gardens.
