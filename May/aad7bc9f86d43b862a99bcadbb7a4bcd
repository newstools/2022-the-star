President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday commissioned a new chancery in the Swiss Capital of Bern. The embassy is expected to enhance multilateral cooperation between Kenya and Switzerland especially in the areas of research, education, training, defence and hospitality. On Thursday while announcing the launch, Kihurani said that Kenya needed strong trade ties with the Swiss. "Kenya is Switzerland’s 16th biggest trading partner in Africa,” he said. He added the new chancery will help enhance the growth of tourism exchange between the two States, with the expectations of rising the growth level of tourism. In attendance was Ambassador Andrew Kihurani among other officials. Kihuria said that President Uhuru will visit Geneva where he is scheduled to address the World Health Assembly on May 22. Uhuru's address will showcase Kenya’s efforts in championing health issues globally.
