TV star Ellen DeGeneres is planning to take a career break before she decides on her next move. The final episode of 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show' will air later this week, and Ellen and her wife Portia de Rossi are now planning to head overseas with some of their close friends, as she embarks on the next chapter of her career. "Right after the show finale airs she, Portia, and her closest friends, including her brother, Vance DeGeneres and his wife, are heading to Rwanda for the opening of her gorilla campus." A source told The Sun newspaper. Her show first premiered in 2003 and has aired more than 3,000 episodes. The news came 10 months after the show faced accusations of a toxic workplace and the departures of three executive producers. The 63-year-old denied that the issues behind the scenes at the show factored in her decision to end it. In April, Ellen took to Twitter to confirm she'd already filmed the last-ever episode of her long-running talk show.
