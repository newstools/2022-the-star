Kenya Prisons coach Josp Barasa believes the tactical changes introduced were catalytic to the team's 3-0 faultless win against Rwanda's APR as the Africa Women’s Volleyball Club Championship in Tunisia entered the third day. The Wardresses, who topped group 'C' with a maximum of nine points, were twice forced to come from behind to defeat their opponents in what proved to be their toughest challenge so far.  The straight-set win was achieved courtesy of an identical 25-20 scoreline. "I am very happy the girls were on top of their game. Our fighting spirit saw us twice come from behind to put APR to the sword," Barasa said. "They (APR) were tough in the beginning but the introduction of Yvonne Wavinya made the difference as we displayed our normal game. Meldine Sande and Pamela Masaisai proved a handful for them too. We are waiting to confirm our next opposition but I already know the team is in Pool A," he noted. Captain Brackcides Agala was equally elated but said they need to back their imperious form with a podium finish. "Topping the group will count for nothing if we can't go all the way to the finals," she noted.  Prisons defeated both Naval and National Alcohol of Ethiopia by 3-0 sets. Other Kenyan representatives Kenya Pipeline have won their opening two matches, scalping Nigeria Customs and Ghana's El Wak Wings. On the other hand, KCB handed Asec Mimmosa of Ivory Coast a rude introduction on an opening day following the 3-0 win. The bankers, however, lost to defending champions de Carthage by the same margin on Monday.
