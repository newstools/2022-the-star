Kenyans can verify their registration details via a text message or by visiting the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission portal. IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati on Friday urged the voters to send an SMS with their ID/passport number to 70000 or visit the commission website portal https://verify.iebc.or.ke to verify their details ahead of the August polls. He said the service which commenced on May 4 will be available for the next 30 days. Chebukati said that a person who duly applied to be registered and his/her name or the biometric data has not been captured correctly in the register of voters may make a claim to the Registration Officer within 30 days. "In the event your details are incorrectly captured, visit your registration center," he said. The Commission had earlier announced that it had suspended the application for new registration. According to Chebukati, the move was to give time for Kenyans to verify their biometric data and particulars of registered voters. In the first phase of the voters' registration exercise that commenced in October last year, the IEBC listed 1.51 million new voters, translating to about 25.3 per cent of its target of six million voters. During the exercise, a total of 396,163 registered voters applied to transfer to registration centres of their choice, while 2,269 changed their particulars. The commission also registered 2,959 new voters from Kenyans in diaspora, 2,964 requests for transfer, and 2,036 applications for change of particulars. The commission had attributed low numbers to voter apathy and national ID-related issues.
