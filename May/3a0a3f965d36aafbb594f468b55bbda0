Six people have been arrested in connection to heckling incident that marred the rally of Azimio La Umoja Presidential running mate Martha Karua in Kirinyaga county last week. Kirinyaga Central deputy County commissioner Daniel Ndege confirmed the arrest on Monday. The six are said to have stoned Karua's convoy in Kagumo and Kerugoya. "The other day there were some people who tried to disrupt law and order. When one of the leaders was coming home, there were some people who were hired by some leaders to hurl stones and shout down the leader," he said. "As we are talking, there are six boys who have been arrested and arraigned in court for disrupting peace and causing hooliganism." Ndege urged residents and parents to guide their children against causing violence in political rallies. " I am urging parents to inform their children that government cannot be dared. Let that chaotic incident witnessed be the first and the last. Whoever will try doing so will face the full wrath of the law." He at the same time fingered a section of politicians who have a penchant for giving youths money so that they can cause chaos in opponents' rallies. Ndege said there is a need for political tolerance as the country heads to the general elections. The arrest of the six comes barely a week after Interior PS Karanja Kibicho asked the police to crack the whip on political rallies' hecklers.
