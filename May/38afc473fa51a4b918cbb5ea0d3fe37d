Wiper Party presidential running mate Andrew Ole Sunkuli has revealed that Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka gave him instructions before flying out of the country. In an interview on Citizen TV, Sunkuli said that Kalonzo instructed him to ensure his allies respect Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and desist from attacking him. He noted that the two leaders also enjoyed a cordial relationship before the running mate issues came about. "Kalonzo gave me a couple of assignments. He told me to ensure that Wiper leaders do not disrespect Raila," Sunkuli said. When asked whether he was aware of what led to Kalonzo's fallout with Raila, Sunkuli argued that by then, he was a Narok Senatorial aspirant and was not at the discussion table where the deal between the duo failed to materialise. He further admitted that he was confused by the current political atmosphere and was waiting for Kalonzo's directives regarding the presidential race. "I cannot say that I know what's happening. I only know what everybody knows. This is a bizarre year, and you should expect a few twists and turns before the train steadies." “If Kalonzo decides to work with Odinga, I will support his decision, but that is not where we are at the moment. Right now, we are in the race,” he noted. However, he insisted that the Wiper leader was determined to run for the presidency. The Wiper boss reportedly flew out of the country to London last Friday for a private visit to London. Before his abrupt departure, there were efforts by Raila Odinga's close allies to formalise discussions with Kalonzo's camp, but that had been unsuccessful because of “non-responsiveness”. The Wiper leader is said to have gagged all his close allies from commenting publicly about his political future until he returns later this week.
