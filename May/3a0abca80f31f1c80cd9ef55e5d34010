Socialite Corazon Kwamboka has two nannies to help her raise her two children. Speaking on her YouTube channel, the mother of two said when she stopped living together with her baby daddy, it was hard to handle two children. "I tried doing things myself but it was overwhelming," she said. "I was under so much pressure and I decided to get a stay-at-home nanny. I have two nannies, one is a day nanny." Corazon said she is now able to have time for herself and the kids. "My day nanny is amazing, I have had her for one year and I am not letting her go anytime soon." On her experience with nannies, Corazon said she has had both good and bad experiences. "I have a nanny who left a few minutes after she got into my house. I have had good nannies who were good with the kids but she wasn't good with other jobs." In the interview, Corazon said she could not rule out if she would reconcile with her baby daddy. "Never say never, especially if it is someone I love, who knows?" Frankie had in an earlier interview said he and Corazon still have a 'relationship'. "I still have a relationship with Corazon no one walked out. I talk to her quite often and she is doing very well."
