Sirisia MP John Waluke has said it’s time for Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga to become president. He said Raila has struggled to make Kenya a better country and has often led in past elections only to be 'shortchanged' at the last minute. Speaking in Mayuba Stadium in his constituency during an Azimio rally on Sunday, Waluke urged members of the Luhya nation to rally behind Raila’s bid. “I'm at the forefront to ensure that Raila wins the August polls. We want things to be smooth because our competitors’ track records cannot be equated to that of Raila,” Waluke said. Raila and his running mate Martha Karua were at the rally. The MP is fighting for reelection despite conviction in Sh298 million graft case. He lodged an appeal and was released on bond. Waluke said he is firmly in the race for reelection despite the court case and has promised to beat his rivals at the ballot. He is scheduled to be cleared on Tuesday by IEBC officials to run for reelection. The Jubilee lawmaker praised Raila for preserving three Cabinet slots for the Luhyas. He said if Raila wins, the region will benefit from his government. “I want to assure you that if Raila wins, this region will change and  collapsed industries will be revived,” he said. Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati said Azimio has not given them any conditions to deliver. “We are enjoying working with Baba because we have not been given any conditions. The Luhya nation is in safe hands,” Wangamati said. Edited by A.N
