Machakos Central MP Victor Munyaka has donated a new school bus to Vota Secondary School. He said the bus will be used to transport learners to sports and educational tours outside school. "Through the NG-CDF, I am able to donate the new school bus to Vota secondary to allow convenient transportation services for students and teachers during academic tours, contests and athletic events that take place outside of school," the legislator said. Munyaka spoke to parents and other stakeholders at Vota Secondary School during the handover ceremony. He requested the school administration to use the bus for the intended purposes only. "The school's good performance motivated me to donate the bus. I advise students to value their education and put more effort into their studies to achieve academic excellence," he said. Munyaka asked teachers to step up their game by ensuring that students are adequately prepared for national exams. "I encourage teachers to continue stepping up their game to ensure learners prepare well before sitting their national exam," the MP said. Munyaka urged parents to invest in their children's education to empower them and improve their lives. "Parental advice is also required for children to be motivated to study hard in school." The MP said education is top of his development agenda. He said he is committed to improving education standards in Machakos and every child has the chance to learn. Machakos county NG-CDF chairman Sylvester Mumo said parents should shape the future of their children through education. "I second our MP's remarks and I would encourage parents to provide adequate education for their children to shape their future careers," Mumo said. Mumo commended Munyaka's efforts in ensuring that the school has a bus.
