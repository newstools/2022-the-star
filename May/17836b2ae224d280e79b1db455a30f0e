Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto on Friday downplayed the appointment of Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua as ODM leader Raila Odinga's running mate in the August polls. Speaking during the Embu county economic forum, Ruto said Raila chose Karua to deputize him because he was in a state of confusion. "Wakati walisikia tunapanga mipango ya mama mboga, na wale wote kuanzia chini tukienda juu, yule mtu wa kitandawili akakimbia kumchukua mama mmoja na kumfanya running mate wake, kwa sababu ya kuchanganyikiwa," Ruto said. Loosely translated to: "When they (Azimio) heard we were planning to lift mama mbogas and all those struggling to eke a living, Raila went ahead and chose a woman running mate out of confusion". Raila unveiled Karua as his running mate on Monday, a day after Ruto chose Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua to deputize him. The ODM leader said he chose Karua because she has proven to be a fighter and not a quitter. “This woman has a beautiful soul as exhibited by her love and passion for her children and grandchildren. She will be a great co-creator and will make a remarkable first woman deputy president of Kenya," Raila said. The Deputy President has been carrying out County Economic Forums, listening to the constituents' grievances with a promise of addressing them once elected president. Ruto held economic talks with residents of Nakuru on Thursday, and with the people of Embu on Friday. On Saturday, he held Murang'a County economic forum. He has on many occasions pledged to fund small business owners so that they can boost their earnings.
