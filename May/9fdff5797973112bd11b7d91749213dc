Mathare United's struggles climaxed on Saturday after they were officially sent packing from the Kenyan Premier League by the Football Kenya Federation Transition Committee. In a letter signed by head of secretariat Linda Ogutu and addressed to Mathare chairman Bob Munro, the Committee said it reached Saturday's decision after the Slum Boys dished out three walkovers in the topflight competition. "We have in our possession the match officials' reports on your matches...pitting yourselves against Bandari FC, Ulinzi Stars FC and Sofapaka FC and which were scheduled to be played...," the statement read. "It is evident therefore that the said matches were not played for the reasons attributed to your team which failed to honour the fixtures and the same were thus awarded to your opponents. “It is discernible from the foregoing that your team has to date failed to play three matches this season. Ogutu said they invoked FKF statutes in their decision to demote Mathare. "As provided for by... the rules and regulations governing Kenyan Football which states; 'any club in a league format that does not turn up for three fixtures in a season and their explanation... is not accepted in all the three incidences to the FKF National Leagues and Competitions Committee, shall be suspended for the rest of the season, shall be relegated to a lower tier for the next season and may face other disciplinary action.' “We therefore hereby write to you decreeing that having failed to play three matches in contravention of the above stated rule... Mathare United FC has been suspended from the FKF Premier League 2021/22 season and shall be relegated to the National Super League for the next season." Editing by Tony Mballa
