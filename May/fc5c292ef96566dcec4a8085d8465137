Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga will name his running mate on Monday ahead of the set deadline of May 16. Spokesman of Raila Odinga Presidential Campaign Secretariat Makau Mutua told Kenyans to hold their horses as the coalition was not intending to name Raila's deputy at the Kamkunji rally on Sunday. "Our campaign is aware that Kenyans are anxious to know the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Presidential ticket. We will make the announcement tomorrow (Monday)," Prof Mutua said. There are reports that the Azimio Running Mate Selection Panel had said Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua is rated highly for the position. Multiple sources told the Star that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth were also recommended to Raila by the panel. The panel had also interviewed governors Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Hassan Joho (Mombasa), Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru) and Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega) for the running mate position last week. Others are Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya and former Emgwen MP Stephen Tarus. The panel was rating the candidates based on constitutional qualifications, understanding of government, personality, political acumen, compatibility and loyalty to the Azimio presidential candidate.
