Your excellencies, dear colleagues, honourable guests. I am pleased to see so many people at our event today. On behalf of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, let me also express my sincere gratitude to each and every one of you for your support and goodwill. Today, we have a wonderful occasion to tell you more about Ukraine and our culture as we mark Vyshyvanka Day. Vyshyvanka is a traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirt or blouse. It is probably the most vivid symbol of my country, which throughout our history has also served as a protector of the Ukrainian identity and our cultural code. Today as you know, we are not only fighting for our independence and our inherent right to be Ukrainians but we are defending democracy and freedom in Europe and beyond. We have been receiving enormous support from countries all over the world. We sincerely appreciate this endless solidarity and support, since only by combining our efforts can we guarantee that good prevails over lies and fake news. And last but not least, I really want to express my wholehearted gratitude to all my colleagues from the embassy and in particular to our spouses as well as our small but really friendly Ukrainian community in Nairobi for their dedication, efforts, sleepless nights and tireless work to make this event happen. Practically all you see as part of the fair has been handmade by them. I wish you a peaceful and enjoyable evening. I hope that by the end of this event, you will know Ukraine better if not fall in love with our charming country. And I want to urge all of you, once again, to stand with Ukraine, as we stand for the free world.
