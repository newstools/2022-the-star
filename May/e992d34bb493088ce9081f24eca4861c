Citizen TV host Willis Raburu and his partner Ivy Namu are pregnant with their second child. Raburu and Namu shared the news on Instagram. "We did it again! One more to adore!" Rumours they were expecting their second child started spreading after she posted a photo on Instagram with a protruding belly. In a Q and A, Namu asked her fans to stop pressuring people when to reveal pregnancy news. "This question is very funny and not in a good way," she said. "With all the factors surrounding pregnancy, surely, it should be up to the peeps involved to share the news at their own time." This will be Raburu's third child. He lost his first daughter with his ex-wife Marya. Last year, he welcomed a son with his now partner Ivy Namu.
