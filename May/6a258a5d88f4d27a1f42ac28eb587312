Campaigns for the Bungoma women representative seat are in top gear and have already attracted two aspirants who are seeking to oust the incumbent Catherine Wambilianga . Those who have declared their quest include Reginalda Wanyonyi of DAP-K and Nancy Kibaba of UDA. Wambilianga will be seeking to be reelection on the Ford Kenya ticket. On Sunday, Wambilinga said she was optimistic of retaining her seat based on her development track record. “Even with the very little resources we have ensured that we have changed lives across the county," she said . She said under her leadership residents have experienced economic empowerment through grants and tents she has given to groups in 45 wards. Wambilianga also said she has successfully issued affirmative action bursaries to learners and teen mothers. “Through the Gender base violence department my office attended to GBV cases  and made follow ups to their logical conclusion," she said. "For instance a we ensured a head teacher at Nandingwa Primary School was interdicted after impregnating a standard 7 pupil." Former women rep Wanyonyi said Wambilianga failed to fulfil her pre-election pledges and she has been killing all the projects she initiated under her regime . “We did a good job during my leadership and even built the current rescue centre that Wambilianga brags of. We are calling upon our people to elect me back so that we can do more,”Wanyonyi said. Kibaba pledge to invest in education by supporting children living with disability to access education. She also promised to champion for a programme that will help fight teenage pregnancy and early marriages. “We will ensure we give school uniforms for the less privileged and start youth programme that will keep many from drug," Kibaba said. She said she will set up a state of the art recording studio for Bungoma youths to enhance their artistic talents. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
