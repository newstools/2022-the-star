Safina Party presidential candidate Jimi Wanjigi has unveiled his plan to eradicate the runaway unemployment and poverty in the country. On Wednesday, Wanjigi promised to create at least one job for each of the 13 million families in Kenya. “There are 13 million households in Kenya. It would go a long way if we create a job or self-employment for at least one family member – and that should not be a difficult thing to do,” Wanjigi said. He noted that the unemployment rate was currently standing at a staggering 6.6 per cent in 2022, up from 2.8 per cent in 2013 when former President Mwai Kibaki left the power. Wanjigi says that the number of unemployed has doubled over the years and currently stands at 5.4 million people as of 2022. He describes the situation as “an injustice to the people of Kenyans, especially the youth", faulting the government for promising them heaven and delivering hell. Wanjigi noted that the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been choked by the multiplicity of trading licenses and compliance certificates, which he intends to fold into one. “We will be a digital government. You don’t need many licenses yet you run one business with little income,” Wanjigi said. Wanjigi said that several licenses were contributing to corruption, as entrepreneurs bribed government officials to allow them to operate without licenses in order to keep their businesses afloat. He has accused the Jubilee administration of doing nothing to salvage the high cost of living affecting Kenyans. The Presidential aspirant has termed the existing tax model as exorbitant and punitive. He has promised to ensure that his administration walks the talk on digitization of government processes. Wanjigi’s promise to revive the economy and ensure it is stable.
