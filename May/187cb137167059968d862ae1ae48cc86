Strathmore University Blades will recruit five players to bolster the team's chances in the 2022/23 season, according to coach Tony Ochieng. The tactician said the varsity will hold trials between May 23 and 25 at the campus courts. Ochieng said he has so far received good response from teachers and expects young players who will make the team a force reckon with. “The new players will be expected to make direct impact in the team,” said Ochieng. He said he will go by the 2021 recruitment trend that brought young players like Dennis Koja, Garang Ding and Timothy Ayieko to the fore. Ochieng is targeting two power forwards, two shooting guards and a point guard. “Previously, we recruited from the school games but since we have not had these games recently, we have resorted to hosting the trials,” he said. The players selected, he said, will get a sports scholarships before the league kicks off. “The team will add more players for Division One league after a two year absence due to the pandemic,” he added. Ochieng said he is satisfied with the teams’ third-place finish in the Premier League last season. “We started the league at a slow pace because of the hectic academic program but the team will now to reach the finals,” revealed Ochieng. “The squad is intact. I will maintain the players since it is a very young team going through a transition,” he said. This year’s league is set to tip off June 4.
