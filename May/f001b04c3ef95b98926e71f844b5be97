Amani National Congress Party leader Musalia Mudavadi has hit out at the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance after Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua was unveiled as the coalition's presidential running mate. ODM leader Raila Odinga named Karua as his deputy at KICC on Monday. Mudavadi, who is a member of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance led by Deputy President William Ruto, scoffed at Azimio citing divisions that emerged over the running mate post. The ANC boss claimed the coalition is on its deathbed considering a move by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to exit the coalition. "The Azimio remote-controlled Presidential candidate unveils his Running mate and Hon. Kalonzo Musyoka bolts out as President Uhuru goes underground! A house built on sinking sand crumbles! Azimio in a nutshell," Mudavadi wrote on Facebook. The appointment of Karua marked the end of anxiety and speculations that had mounted on who Raila was to appoint as deputy. The Azimio running mate selection panel gave three names to the opposition chief to choose his suitable deputy. The names were submitted in order of priority. Sources said the panel chaired by former minister Noah Wekesa had settled on Karua, Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as the top three candidates. Kalonzo has however turned down the chief cabinet secretary's offer and announced his exit from the Azimio coalition. "We have agreed to separate ways with Azimio la Umoja and compare notes as we do so. I wish Raila's running mate Karua well," he said. He says he will run as a president on a Wiper party ticket. Kalonzo unveiled Andrew Leteipa Sunkuli as his running mate.
