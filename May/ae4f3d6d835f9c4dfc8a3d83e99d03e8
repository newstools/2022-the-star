Reports that Ugandan Minister For Internal Affairs Kahinda Otafire said poor people won't go to heaven are true. The minister said those who keep praying to God to get them out of poverty are disturbing God because they were given hands to work and also become rich. He made the remarks at an event in St Klaus Comprehensive Trade School in Bufunjo village, Kifuko town council in Kyenjojo district, Western Uganda. He was explaining to students that hard work is the antidote to poverty during which he made the viral remarks. "Poor people will not go to heaven because they insult God through lamentations and accusations every day," the Minister said, "Why do you disturb God by asking him for money all the time yet he gave you hands, eyes, brains, ears, land, and rains amongst others? The tools he gave you are enough to make you prosper. " The Fact Checker has verified the remarks and found they are factual. Credible media houses such as New Vision in Uganda have also reported him saying so. The remarks went viral on social media with some doubting whether they were factual. The Ugandan minister is, however, not new in making controversial remarks.
