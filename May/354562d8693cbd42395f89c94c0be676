Governor Alfred Mutua’s party Maendeleo Chap Chap (MCC) has been stopped by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal to exit Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition. On Tuesday, the Tribunal struck out the complaint by MCC on grounds that it was prematurely filed. It has also ruled that MCC should have first invoked the internal dispute resolution mechanisms before going to the tribunal. The MCC party moved to the Tribunal on Monday, stating that they were not aware of the contents of the coalition agreement with Azimio la Umoja. They sought orders to stay the gazette notice of April 14, 2022, which listed the party as a member of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party. The applicant, Martin Mugo Maina, claimed the Registrar of Political parties listed Maendeleo Chap Chap party without procedural compliance. "The 2nd Respondent unlawfully listed the Interested Party as a member party to the 1st Respondent vide its gazette notice of 14th April 2022 without the ratification of such a resolution and without the procedural compliance of the party constitution" read the application in part. The applicant further stated that the Maendeleo Chap Chap party was included in the coalition party without procedural compliance with the Party Constitution and without the sanction of the relevant organ of the party and thus such coalition is a null and void.
