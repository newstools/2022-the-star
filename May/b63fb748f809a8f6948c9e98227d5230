Murang'a County Governor Mwangi Wa Iria has said he will report IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati as a missing person to the Directorate of Criminal Investigation. This was after his efforts to have a sit down with him and get clearance and reasons of the recent ongoing events were futile. "I have been looking for my returning officer and I am now going to file a report with the DCI that he is missing. He only appears in the media at night to mention me then vanishes," he said. "I camped at Bomas until 11 p.m on Sunday, but he managed to duck me. On Monday, I went back to Bomas and then came back here, but I still have not met him. Where is he?" Wa Iria's name missed from the IEBC nomination register and has been seeking audience with IEBC. He claimed that Chebukati had deliberately frustrated his efforts to see him claiming foul play. He accused the IEBC chairman of prematurely disqualifying him while he has been meeting other presidential hopefuls submitting their papers. "He does not want to meet one of his candidates yet he has met all, is there anything wrong between me and him? He called Kalonzo from London to come and fill the documents, similarly with Wajackoya, yet he has blocked me from meeting him," he said. On Monday, the Usawa Kwa Wote party presidential aspirant was blocked the entrance to the Bomas of Kenya. He was accompanied by his supporters and they blocked the Bomas gates in protest after his name was omitted from the IEBC national presidential register.
