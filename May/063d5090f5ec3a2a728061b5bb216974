The Supreme Court has set aside a decision by the tribunal that recommended the removal of Justice Martin Muya from office. The apex court has also said that Muya's conduct did not amount to gross misconduct. The complaint that led to Muya’s sacking was filed by NIC Bank. The Tribunal had concluded that he was guilty of gross misconduct for delaying for five months, reasons for a ruling dated May 30, 2017, in a commercial row pitting Kipsigis Stores against NIC Bank. According to the Tribunal, there was an unjustifiable delay by the judge in delivering the ruling which saw the bank lose a substantial amount of money. But Muya through Lawyer Philip Nyachoti told the Apex Court that the NIC file had gone missing and when it was traced, the Judge delivered the reasons for his ruling.
