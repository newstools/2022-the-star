Nakuru DCI officers have arrested an MCA aspirant from Meru county accused of defrauding a M-Pesa shop of Sh64,000. According to Rift Valley DCI boss Mwenda Meme, the suspect Benson Thuranira Kathiai is an MCA aspirant for Muthara ward in Meru county. Thuranira was arrested after the M-Pesa operator raised alarm upon discovering Sh64,000 had already been deposited in the suspect's account. "Thuranira entered a M-Pesa shop and asked the owner to deposit Sh64,000 in his mobile number. When the M-Pesa lady deposited, he manipulated his mobile phone and it could not reflect the deposit message. He, therefore, told the lady to return his cash which she did but upon checking her message, she found out the money had already been deposited to Thuranira's account," Meme said. This prompted the Mpesa lady to raise an alarm during which the suspect was arrested. Meme also confirmed that upon more investigation, they found out that the suspect has other similar cases in Shauri Moyo, Mwea and Mombasa. He is accused of conning a woman in Busia of 60 bags of groundnuts and 60,000 shillings. He is also previously accused of defrauding a Meru lady of Sh100,000. Thuranira told the DCI officers that he looking for money to do his campaigns. "We are appealing to the members of the public to care of their money and the first check whether those they're attending to are genuine," Meme stated. The suspect will be arraigned on Friday.
