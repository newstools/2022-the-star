Liverpool will meet Real Madrid who qualified for the Champions League final in sensational style by defeating Manchester City 6-5 on aggregate in Wednesday's semi final. The Spanish and English giants will play the final at Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France, on Saturday, May 28. On paper, Liverpool is the better club, but Real Madrid appears to be a team of destiny after living on the edge for the entire knockout round and somehow surviving. Real Madrid was 2-0 down against PSG in the 61st minute of the round of 16's second leg before Karim Benzema scored a hat trick within an 18-minute span to grab a 3-2 aggregate win.
