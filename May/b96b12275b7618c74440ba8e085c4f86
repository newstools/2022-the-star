Olympic 100m silver medalist Fred Kerley says he expects an electric atmosphere at Moi Stadium, Kasarani during the third edition of the Kip Keino Classic on Saturday. This year's competition will be the first time fans will be allowed into the stadium after the previous two editions were held behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. Kerley said he can't wait to interact with the passionate home crowd in his second visit to the Kenyan capital. "I really loved the energy that was at the stadium when I competed here last year. Kenya is a nice place and I am happy to be here once again. I heard there are going to be fans in the stadium this time round so that should be really exciting," the American said. Kerley is one of this year's headline attractions and will be expected to raise the roof at Kasarani when he comes up against Olympic champion Lamont Marcell Jacobs of Italy in a rematch of last year's Tokyo Olympics duel. One other sprinter to who the American tips his hat off to is Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala who will be hoping to add another win to his burgeoning reputation on Saturday. "He is a cool guy who has been running some wonderful times. Last year at Kasarani he ran 9.77, which was a really fast time. The stadium is nice...last time I had a wonderful experience and so I am looking forward to running against him and the others," Kerley said of Africa's fastest man. He further admitted that his main goal is to keep on winning more medals even as he targets fast times. "Records don't mean anything unless you are winning gold. In track and field, what matters the most is how many wins you have. Records will always be broken but if you don't have titles to your name then it means nothing," Kerley, who clocked a personal best of 19.76 in Nairobi last year, said.
