Kitui election manager Samuel Macharia has said he is beyond manipulation and shady election deals. “I have an office where any aspirant can access me for any official matter. You should not expect to summon me at social places or hotels for any shady dealings," he said. Macharia said the election results will reflect the true decision of voters and not any other consideration. Macharia spoke on Wednesday at the Kitui multipurpose training and development centre in Kitui town. The official held a pre-registration meeting with candidates seeking county level positions like governorship, senator and woman representative. Present were Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu and her opponents Julius Malombe, David Musila, Jonathan Mueke, Woman Representative Irene Kasalu and Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu. “I have no room for underhand dealings. God has blessed me with good health and some little riches here and there. I do not want to soil myself through shady things that would disenfranchise voters,” Macharia said. The official was posted to Kitui about a fortnight ago and it is not clear why he spoke of his integrity. Musila had previously told his supporters that an IEBC official had a hand in denying him victory in 2017. In 2017, Musila took a shot at the gubernatorial seat but came second to Ngilu. The then pioneer Governor Malombe came third. Kitui county commissioner Mbogoi Rioba said aspirants should conduct peaceful campaigns and guard against inciting their supporters into violence. He said the security apparatus will provide sufficient security during campaigns. Police commander Leah Kithei said all aspirants should follow the law and notify the nearest police station of any meetings they hold. Although she described Kitui as a generally peaceful county, Kithei said incidents such as the recent violence in Mwingi Central, will not be tolerated. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
