Bahati has become the second Kenyan artiste to hit a million subscribers on YouTube after Otile Brown in February. Just like Otile, Bahati is expected to receive his YouTube’s Gold Play Button plaque, a testament to the hard work and dedication needed to reach that level. Bahati hit the milestone after the release of his latest song 'Sweet Love' featuring his lover Diana Marua. The track released on Monday highlights their love and marital bliss that has withstood all the challenges. In the song, Bahati serenades his wife Diana B with all the sweet nothings every woman would want to hear after nearly five years of marriage. On the other end, Diana thanks Bahati for staying by her side even as trolls told him to leave her over their age difference.
