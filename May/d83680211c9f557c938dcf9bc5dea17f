UDA supporters in Naivasha have welcomed the decision by the political party’s tribunal to hold fresh party nominations in the constituency. Former Naivasha MP John Kihagi said the decision by the tribunal ordering for repeat nominations is timely. Over the weekend, the tribunal directed the party to hold repeat primaries after the incumbent Jayne Kihara was awarded the nomination certificate. Trouble started two weeks ago after Kihagi controversially won the primaries, only for the party’s nomination board to reverse the decision due to some irregularities. Kihara was awarded the certificate instead forcing Kihagi to seek redress at the tribunal, which directed the party to hold the primaries again. Kihagi said justice had been done and he welcomes the repeat exercise. He lashed out at Kihara for seeking Deputy President William Ruto's support in the saga that has split the party supporters in Naivasha. “We welcome the decision by the political party tribunal and we are ready for the repeat exercise, as ordered,” he said. Kihagi said his supporters are fully behind DP Ruto and party officials should not take sides in the primaries. “Some people are already claiming that they have the support of the party. We are calling for fairness in the nomination exercise,” he said. One of his supporters Wangari Kabera told of their joy after the appeal was heard and ruled in their favour by the tribunal. “These marks one of the biggest days for us. We are ready for the nominations and we are sure that we shall win,” she said. This was echoed by Julius Kibe who said justice had been done after the party’s nomination board unfairly awarded the certificate to their rival. “Naivasha people should be allowed to make their decisions freely in the coming nominations as ordered by the court,” he said.
