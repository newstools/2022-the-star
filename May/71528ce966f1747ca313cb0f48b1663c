Kanu party, an affiliate member of the Azimio La Umoja- One Kenya Coalition Party on Thursday fronted Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka to the Azimio Presidential Running Mate Selection Panel. According to the party national chairman Gideon Moi, Kalonzo fits the bill and is the most referred person to deputise Raila. However, hours after the endorsement, a fake statement claiming to originate from the party was spread on the social media, alleging that the party now backs its chairman for the position. "Apart from meeting the constitutional threshold for nomination as Deputy Presidential Candidate, Gideon Moi comes highly recommended with an impeccable record in public service, having served two-five year terms as Senator for Baringo County," the fake post claimed. The party flagged the statement as fake, asking Kenyans to ignore it. "Ignore", Kanu posted on its official Twitter account. After endorsing Kalonzo, Kanu chairman posted the same statement through his official social media account, including Twitter and Facebook. The same was echoed by the party. “It is our sincere hope that this panel will consider and find him appropriate for the position of Deputy President and consequently recommend his selection as such", Moi had said in his letter to the selection panel. The selection panel is in search of suitable candidate of Raila Odinga running mate ahead of the August 9 general election.
