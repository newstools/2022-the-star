Tanzania's singer Harmonize has been arrested. The Kwangwaru hitmaker is being held at Kileleshwa police stations. Sources privy to the developments say the music star was arrested in connection to a simmering scandal of allegedly failing to appear at several clubs in Nairobi despite having received money for the same. The arrest came hours after he performed at a concert at KICC in Nairobi. The singer has been in the country since Friday. He was to exit on Sunday only to be arrested while planning to leave the country. Since his arrival in the country, the singer has had a number of run-ins. On Friday, there was a dramatic encounter between Harmonize and revellers at a club in Nairobi. Eric Omondi who was with the comedian said that there was a misunderstanding from fans on what Harmonize was expected to do at the club. "A lot of things happened, it was a party and some people were excited...the club was small. There is a difference between a concert and/or event. Kenyans must understand that it was a club appearance/technical appearance/meet and greet/ an afterparty," Eric Omondi said. He defended Harmonize's brief performance at the club, saying the Kwangwaru hitmaker was not obliged to entertain revellers that night. "The artist is supposed to just chill, he is not supposed to perform. Harmonize was coming to perform at KICC, Kenyans should understand. You can even pay 1 million, you know what a club appearance is...it happens worldwide." People themselves demanded that Harmonize should perform, so he sang some songs. Even tomorrow we have another club appearance and the artists will not perform, unless at his own will. He should not be told what to do," Eric added.
