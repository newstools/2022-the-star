ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday warned against any plans of rigging votes in the August 9 general elections. Speaking during a Nakuru campaign rally, Mudavadi said they are well prepared to thwart any attempt to rig their votes. "Watu wasidhubutu kuiba kura za Mheshimiwa William Ruto. Sisi tunawaambia wasijaribu kwa sababu petition ambayo ilikuweko ya Maraga ilisema tally ya kura za president itakuwa Form 34A. Kwa hivo wasijaribu kupindua," Mudavadi said. Loosely translated to, "People should not try to steal William Ruto's votes. We are telling them not to try because the petition filed during CJ Maraga's time said the presidential vote tally will be in Form 34A. So do not try and change it". Mudavadi added the Alliance will have agents at every polling station countrywide to ensure their votes are protected. He called out ICT CS Joe Mucheru for meddling in the election affairs saying they will not allow him to control the IEBC. Mudavadi was reiterating his Saturday's remarks in the Murang'a rally where he said the opinion polls are distorted to build ground for election rigging. He said the TIFA polls showing that Azimio's Raila Odinga and Martha Karua with a 39 per cent popularity, 4 points on Ruto and his running mate Rigathi Gachagua was not right. “The IEBC  is responsible for managing a free and fair election. However, we have started seeing signs that the CA is trying to manipulate the Commission's boss Wafula Chebukati," Mudavadi said. The ANC leader did not produce evidence to back up his allegations.
