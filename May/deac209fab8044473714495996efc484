Gengetone singer Mejja says beauty and money can't keep a man grounded in any relationship, only peace. "A man settles where he finds peace. Not beauty, not money. Not status, but peace," he wrote on Instagram. Mejja ex-lover Milly Wairimu went on an online tirade about the rapper on Valentine's Day. She said he is a great celeb but terrible at relationships. She went on to announce she had moved on with someone else. "Manze najua mnapenda huyu msee but manze kenye alinipitishia! I don’t think any human deserves it," she wrote. She said she is still a fan as far as music goes but wishes she had never met him. "But I want to be better, not bitter," she said. Mejja did not pick when called by Word Is.
