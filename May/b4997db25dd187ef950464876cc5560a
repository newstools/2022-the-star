Three young men suspected of stealing livestock in Emusanda village in Kakamega County were on Friday attacked by a swarm of bees. According to a police report, at around 10:00 am, Hillary Momanyi, 22, John Bukhazio, 28, and Wilnstom Mutiele, 20, were seen near the station with a cow and a goat suspected to have stolen from one Imbiaka Tolibert. "He reported that his calf and a goat had been stolen on Wednesday at Shibuli police post," the police said. After waiting for a police report in vain, Tolibert decided to seek the services of a traditional medicine man. The traditional medicine man is said to have performed some rituals in the cowshed and the goats' pen in a bid to trace the animals. "Today, three youths emerged having been attacked by a swarm of bees. They were found in possession of the cow, while one was carrying a goat on his shoulders," the police said. The three were from Mumias East Sub-county. Police said the medicine man administered some herbs to the three suspects, and the bees disappeared. The suspects were later arrested and are in custody, waiting to be arraigned.
