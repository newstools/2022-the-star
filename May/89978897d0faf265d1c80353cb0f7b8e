Kenya's representatives, KCB and Kenya Pipeline, have set a date for a mouthwatering semifinal clash at the Africa Women’s Volleyball Club Championship slated for Monday. The bankers saw off perennial rivals Kenya Prisons in straight sets of 25-17 25-14 25-14 while Pipeline beat Cameron's FAP 3-1 in sets of 15-25 24-26 27-25 13-25. KCB head coach, Japheth Munala, admits he expects a tough encounter. “I'm extremely elated with the girls' achievements thus far. Kenya Prisons are a very good team and beating them in the quarters was a tough assignment. The going doesn't get any easier as Pipeline awaits," Munala said. He added:" They boast quality but with the same desire, we stand a real chance of playing in the finals. How nice it will be to lift the prestigious trophy because it's been a while since we won." KCB emerged second in pool B after losing to defending champion de Carthage in their second match. The Edith Wisa captained side scalped both Nigeria Customs and Uganda’s Ndejje University. “I am so proud of this team and our technical bench for guiding us well. We can’t wait to play in the semis and hopefully win and go to the finals,” KCB captain Mercy Moim said. Editing by Tony Mballa
