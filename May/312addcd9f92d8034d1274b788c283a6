South Korea captain Son Heung-min is set to play on home soil with his club side Tottenham Hotspur after they announced a pre-season friendly against Sevilla in Suwon in July. Spurs enjoy a massive following in South Korea thanks to Son, who finished joint top scorer in the Premier League this season with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. Spurs said the match will take place at Suwon World Cup Stadium on July 16, three days after they face a K League select in Seoul. It will be Spurs’ third visit to the country. Tottenham and Sevilla both finished fourth in their domestic campaigns to secure automatic berths in next season’s Champions League. Meanwhile, Aston Villa have signed French midfielder Boubacar Kamara from Marseille on a five-year contract. Kamara, 22, will join the Midlands club on a free transfer when his Marseille contract expires at the end of June. He is the second player to join Villa this month after Philippe Coutinho made his loan from Barcelona permanent. “I am delighted that we have been able to attract one of the most promising young talents in European football,” said Villa boss Steven Gerrard. “We have a very clear plan to make our team stronger and Bouba is an important part of that.” Kamara made 170 appearances for Marseille after graduating from the club’s academy in 2016, helping the club reach the Europa League final in 2018 and finish runners-up to Paris Saint Germain in Ligue 1 this season. He has nine caps for France U21s and has been called up to the senior squad for the first time for Nations League matches against Denmark, Austria, and Croatia next month.
