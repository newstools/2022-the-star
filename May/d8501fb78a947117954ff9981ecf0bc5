Just like the way TikTok allows users to create a reaction video from a comment, Instagram has said it is working on the same tool. The new option will prompt reel users to create a reaction video right from the reel share sheet. Once the user clicks on the options menu found on the reel they want to react to, he or she will be able to record a reaction video. The trend will see growth and the recommendation of thousands of related clips on a single trend. The tool will roll out globally at a later date.
