Presidential aspirant George Luchiri Wajackoyah arrived at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi donning a red durag for a meeting with Independent Electoral Boundaries Commission on Monday. With his dress code, in which one would easily mistake him for just another wannabe weed-puffing man, the lawyer showed up ready to face IEBC presidential election returning officer Wafula Chebukati. The lecturer is among the aspirants who will in the next eight days face Chebukati for clearance to run in the August 9 polls. The rigorous nine-day exercise started countrywide on Sunday as aspirants presented themselves and vital documents to the commission for clearance. Wajackoyah, 61, was born in Western, and he is seeking to be Kenya's fifth president. His position on wanting to legalise weed should he succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta has caused a storm on social media, but he is determined to achieve his goal. This is not the first time the professor is eyeing the presidential seat. In 2013, he announced that he would vie for President, but bolted out at the last minute without any explanation. He holds an LLB (Hons) from the University of Wolverhampton (UK), CCL/LLM, School of Oriental & African Studies, University of London, LLM University of Warwick (UK), LLM University of Baltimore, and Advanced Diploma in French from the University of Burundi. In past interview with the Star, he narrated how he was abandoned by his parents after they divorced when he was 16 years old. The law scholar found his way to Nairobi at a tender age and became a street boy and had to learn the art of survival. At some point, he was adopted by veteran politician, the late Joseph Kamotho, who schooled him.
