Electricity distributor, Kenya Power has appointed Geoffrey Waswa Muli as acting managing director, replacing Rosemary Oduor who has acted in that capacity since August, last year. In a statement signed by the company secretary on Tuesday, Waswa will take over from Oduor who has proceeded on annual leave. "The appointment of Geoffrey Waswa Muli as acting MD takes effect on May 17," Kenya Power's statement reads in part. The firm is yet to appoint a substantive MD since the resignation of Barnard Ngugi in unclear circumstances. The power utility firm has in the recent past been rocked by mismanagement allegations issues, hurting profitability. This informed ongoing energy reforms championed by President Uhuru Kenyatta's energy task force that has recommended power tariff renegotiation with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) with a view of slashing power bills for consumers by 30 per cent before the end of the current financial year. It has already implemented 15 perfect cuts that took effect early this year. Last year, the listed power utility reported a net profit of Sh3.82 billion for the six months to December 2021, a huge improvement from the Sh138.36 million it made over a similar period in 2020. Muli is an insider who prior to his appointment was General Manager in charge of regional coordination. He holds Masters of Business Administration (Strategic option) and is currently pursuing a PhD in the same field.
