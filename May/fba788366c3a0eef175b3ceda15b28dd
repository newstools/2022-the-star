The late Mzee Jackson Kiprotich Kibor's will has been publicly read out to the family in Eldoret under tight police security. The will was read by Lawyer Wilson Kalya and details include how Mzee Kibor shared out his more than 5,000 acres of land, real estate and other assets. Kibor's eldest son Phillip Kibor addressed the media in the company of his brother Reuben Kibor. Reuben is the son of Kibor's youngest wife Yunita. "We have met here as a family for the reading of the will and it has been done clearly by lawyer Kalya," Phillip said. He said the family had largely agreed with details in the will that Mzee Kibor wrote in February last year. He said Lawyer Bundotich had been identified as the executor of the will. Phillip said that, in the will, the father had largely shared out his property among his four wives who will then share out with their children. Phillip said Kibor had included 26 children in the will, and in one unique case, he directly gave out some of his assets to one of his grandchildren. The grandchild is the son of Phillip. "Those who are dissatisfied with the will have the opportunity to petition," Phillip said. However, he said they will still sit down as a family and iron out any problems that may arise from the will. Yunita had last week complained that some family members had taken away property given to her but Phillip said the matter had been addressed in the will. He noted that the will largely detailed what Mzee Kibor had said before he died. Kibor died on March 6 at the age of 88 and was buried on April 1 at his Kabenes home in Uasin Gishu county. The Will was read out for more than 3 hours and Kibor's siblings who are out of the country followed online
