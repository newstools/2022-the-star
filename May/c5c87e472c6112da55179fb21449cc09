Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has urged Kenyans not to elect DP William Ruto saying he is a liar. Ngilu said Ruto would cripple the country's economy if voted for as president. “You can bear me witness that when Ruto came here he lied that he had given you money, but you got nothing,” she said. “He should not talk while other leaders are doing so.” Ngilu said she would rather spoil her vote than choose the DP. “Even if he came to me carrying bags of money and soothing me to vote for him, I would runway than face him,” she said. The governor spoke on Monday in Tseikuru where she commissioned a tarmacked road. She also showed interest in becoming Raila's running mate saying should she be picked, the Kamba community will firmly be in government. “I fearlessly vied for presidency 20 years ago against President Moi and this shows I am capable of becoming a deputy president,” the governor said. Ngilu also issued 8,500 title deeds to Mumoni ward residents. For nearly six decades, the residents in Mwingi North have remained without land rights for a lack of title deeds. The residents are however happy and relieved after getting the crucial documents. Speaking at Katse playground, Ngilu regretted that unscrupulous politicians had been using the title deeds card to dupe voters into electing them only to renege on their promise to fight for their land rights. She thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for the cooperation they accorded her government in implementing the area's land adjudication. “It is such a pleasure to fulfil the promise I made to you in 2019. Today every landowner will receive their title deed in line with President Kenyatta's plan to legally settle every Kenyan,” she said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
