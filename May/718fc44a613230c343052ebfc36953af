Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi and his party Pamoja African Alliance (PAA) were on Tuesday welcomed to Kenya Kwanza Alliance by DP William Ruto. During the Karen event, Kingi gave reasons for decamping Raila Odinga's Azimio, saying the main one was the deep secrets that run through the Coalition. "Dealings in Azimio are shrouded in disturbing deep secrets and mistrust, consultation and decisions are made by a few and forced down the throats of the majority of the constituent parties." The governor said that Azimio was non-committal to his people. Kingi also read an agreement signed by the alliance and PAA. Both Kingi's PAA and Alfred Mutua's Maendeleo Chap Chap decamped from Azimio on Monday, where they were received by Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula.
