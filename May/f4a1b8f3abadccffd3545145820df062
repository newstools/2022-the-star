A statement alleged to have been made by North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong Un in reference to Africans is fake. The statement, which has been circulating on social media, indicated that Kim implored Africans to cease aping the Western culture and instead remain true to their way of life. Kim is alleged to have wondered why Africans are keen to follow what the Americans say or do rather than focusing on what their culture dictates. "I wonder how the whites successfully convinced Africans that polygamy is a sin but homosexuality is a human right. Africans should learn how to practice their religion. Until the day that Africans will start practising their own culture, they will never develop," reads the fake statement Kim was accused of making. Fact-Checker however has debunked the remarks and discovered that the North Korean Supreme Leader has not made such remarks. The remarks have not been reported by any reliable media house,  a clear indicator it could have been generated to mislead the world. Considering its weight, the matter would have been widely covered by local and international media in the event it was factual. Kim Jong Un is a recognized leader worldwide and his attack on Africans would obviously be covered by the media because such an angle would have been a piece of big news. For one to verify such remarks, it is advised to check with reliable local and (or) international media to see whether it has been covered. In the event the matter is not covered by any of the media and the message was shared by an unreliable source, one should therefore disregard it until a reliable source confirms. Some of the reliable International media that would cover such include BBC, Reuters, Sky News, AFP, and Al Jazeera among many others. For local media, the Star is your best bet.
