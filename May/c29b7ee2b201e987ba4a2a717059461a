Kenya Ports Authority ran riot against Kenya Defence Forces, demolishing the soldiers 3-0 in a Kenya Volleyball Federation league match at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. KPA took the first set 25-17 as the coastal side made powerful blocks to deny the soldiers in what proved to be their biggest strength. The two sides went up 8-8 in the second before KPA steered clear 18-10. KDF conceded easy points on the serve, leaving coach Elisha Aliwa frustrated on the touchline as KPA took it 25-17. Any efforts by KDF to pull a comeback were thwarted as free-scoring KPA killed off the game with a 25-16 third set win. Following their two fifth-leg wins, KPA assistant coach Samson Sunguti, observed that they are safely through into the playoffs. Prior to the fifth leg matches, KPA were leading the standings with 16 points, one point ahead of champions the General Service Unit. “We are through to the playoffs. Our players are in top form having participated at the African Club Championships recently and everything seems to be working well for us,” said Sunguti. Outside hitter Enock Mogeni, who recently returned from a short professional stint in Egypt, returned to the court, though briefly with Sunguti revealing that they are working on ways to bring the best out of the attacker. “We are still trying to fix him in another position. We hope he will be available for the playoffs,” said Sunguti. KDF team manager Alfred Chedotum said they lost to a better team, adding that their remaining matches are a do-or-die affair in the race for the playoffs. “We should not be bitter because we lost to a better team but we must find our way to the playoffs. We have to win our remaining matches. The advantage is that we are done with the tough fixtures.” In another match, Prisons Nairobi beat their Central counterparts in straight sets of 25-19, 25-20,25-23. Elsewhere, Trailblazers overcame Nyanza Prisons 3-0 (25-16, 25-10, 25-12).
