KCB edged Strathmore Leos 12-10 to win the Kabeberi Sevens at the RFUEA ground on Sunday. The bankers dominated proceedings in the opening minutes and Bob Muhati crossed the whitewash with Levi Aminga converting for a 7-0 lead. Jacob Ojee then showed the students defence a clean pair of heels to touch down for an unconverted try and a 12-0 lead at the break. A half-time pep talk by Leo's coach Luis Kisia worked wonders for the varsity side with Joseph Ayiro scoring two quick tries both of which were not converted for a 12-10 lead. Strathmore piled on the pressure but a valiant bankers' defence held on for victory of the opening leg of the circuit. Coach Dennis Mwanja was delighted with the victory but said there is still room for improvement heading into next weekend's Christie Sevens at the same venue. "We will get better. There are a couple of areas we can improve on and we must execute better in both attack and defence," said Mwanja. Leo's coach Louis Kisia blamed the poor first half for the defeat. "We had to change some things at halftime but going forward, we must play well from minute one to minute 14," said Kisia. Oilers took the bronze medal position after beating Homeboyz 36-5 while Mwamba finished fifth after edging Masinde Muliro 26-5.
