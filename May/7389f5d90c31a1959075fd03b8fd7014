Kenya Olympic Association president Moses Tanui has urged Brand Kenya and other corporates tasked with marketing the country to leverage on the reputation of Olympians globally. Speaking during a gala to honour the country's Olympians over the weekend, the two-time Boston Marathon champion said many Kenyan Olympians are forgotten and neglected as soon as the global extravaganza is over. "This association is meant to help them fight for their interests, pursue their recognition by the government and mentor them in preparation for a life beyond competitive sport upon retirement,” said Tanui Tanui, a former 10,000m world champion, said the country has a rich history dating back to the days of the legendary Kipchoge Keino, Robert Wangila and recently Eliud Kipchoge. “We have a rich history in the Olympics and we need to cherish and nurture and tell stories about it for posterity. Kenya's great days are ahead and we hope this will inspire many who want to become our future Olympians,” noted Tanui. Tanui said the country has over 587 Olympians going back to the 1956 Olympics when the country first participated. 131 of these have registered with the World Olympians Association and have membership certificates. Vice President of the Kenya Olympians Association, Lydia Okech, who represented Kenya in the 100m and 200m sprints at the 1966 Commonwealth Games and during the 1968 Mexico Olympics said she hopes to see more ladies involved in sports. "Many Kenyan girls and women are unaware that some of us who started sprinting barefoot and made it onto the Olympic stage representing Kenya. We want to encourage Kenyan women that we have been there and that they too can be world-beaters in various Olympic disciplines. We are hoping that our passion and flame will continue into future generations," added Okech. Those in attendance included Billy Konchellah, Mathew Birir, Catherine Ndereba, Mercy Wesitula among others.
