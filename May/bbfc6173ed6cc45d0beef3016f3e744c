Algeria's Imane Khelif wrote a new chapter in history on Wednesday by becoming the first African boxer to qualify for the finals of Women's World Boxing Championships. The 23-year-old Tokyo Olympics quarter-finalist and the Nation's Cups gold medalist, surmounted a tough challenge from Chelsey Heijnen of the Netherlands in their closely contested semi-finals bout. She will now face Ireland's southpaw battler Sara Amy Broadhurst in the finals slated for Friday. Broadhurst cruised past India's Parveen in the first light-welterweight semi-final bout. Khelif is one of the gold medal favorites of the light welterweight (63kg). She boasts a wealth of experience having won all of her international contests since July 2021. The AFBC African Champion was a gold medallist at the Strandja Memorial Tournament. Editing by Tony Mballa
