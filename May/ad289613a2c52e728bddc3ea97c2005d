Socialite Corazon Kwamboka was not the reason Maureen Waititu and Frankie broke up. In a video posted online, Kwamboka wrote the caption, "When you are being blamed for breaking a relationship." In the video, the social media personality lip-synced, "I did not open the door, I found it opened... I did not touch the door." Maureen and Frankie called it quits in 2019 without disclosing the reason behind their breakup. Frankie said he and Maureen separated because of irreconcilable differences. "We were not necessarily happy at that time. So we figured it was best for us to go our separate ways." He said he met Corazon after he had already broken up with the mother of his two children.
