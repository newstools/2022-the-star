President Bio is in the country for a five-day State Visit where he is expected to meet his host President Uhuru Kenyatta for bilateral talks. During the talks ,7 Memorandum of Understanding aimed at further enhancing relations will be signed. This year’s Madaraka Day celebrations will come 69 days before Kenyans go to the polls to elect Kenya’s fifth new president. It will also be Uhuru’s last national celebrations which will be held at Uhuru Gardens in Nairobi, which he referred to as the ‘people’s garden’. The garden was publicly opened during last year’s Jamhuri Day fete, where the celebrations were held but was then closed to allow completion of some sections. President Uhuru chose the garden as the place to hold his last public national celebration while in office. It is at Uhuru Gardens where Kenyans gathered to celebrate its independence in 1963 and after the nation got republic status in 1964. At least 30,000 Kenyans are expected to attend and have their last national celebrations with Uhuru, which will also be the last for the Jubilee regime. Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho has led the national celebrations committee in the inspection of the ongoing preparations for the Madaraka day celebrations at the garden.
