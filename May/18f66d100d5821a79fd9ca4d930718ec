Comedian YY was yesterday blasted for recording his wife, who was struggling in hospital. In a video shared on Instagram, YY said his wife fell sick and had to be rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. "3am last night got us. I was so scared @marya_okoth couldn’t breathe…," he captioned the video. YY, who is promoting a certain hospital in town, angered his fans, who said the video was unnecessary as his wife's life mattered more than the advert. A fan identified as jeanetteatieno31 wrote, "And you had the time to record and someone wasn't breathing at 3 am? Lost nation." chief_mzazi: We don't pray for sickness but if it strikes, you won't find time to film. Usicheze na ugonjwa, ask around what it means. Anyway promotion lazima ipigwe."
