Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate Rigathi Gachagua on Friday asked deputy president William Ruto to allocate a 50 per cent share of his government to the Mt Kenya region in the event he wins the presidency. Speaking in Embu on Friday during the county economic forum, Gachagua urged Mt Kenya people to invest their votes in Ruto so that they can be rewarded with a big share of the government. "I am proposing an application for a 50 per cent share of Ruto's government," Gachagua said. "But applying for government shares is one thing and getting the share is another. For us to get a big share, we must vote in large numbers." The Mathira MP said since ANC Party leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula applied for a 30 per cent share and are working towards achieving it, the Mt Kenya region should deliver many votes to raise their share. "Our ownership of this coming government will be determined by the number of votes we cast in favour of Ruto. Therefore, make sure we turn out in large numbers and vote for Ruto," Gachagua added. Mudavadi and Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula signed to deliver 70 per cent of the Western votes in order to receive a 30 per cent share of the government. Besides, Mudavadi will be appointed a chief cabinet secretary while Wetangula will be the speaker of the National Assembly. Gachagua also used the opportunity to champion the needs of police officers in the country. He requested Ruto to build boarding schools that will accommodate the needs of police officers in the country. He explained that the many deployments in the force inconvenience the children's learning. "They have requested this in the spirit of Bottoms up since the only existing boarding schools belong to children of high ranking officers," he added.
