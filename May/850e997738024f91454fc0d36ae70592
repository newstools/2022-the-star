Step 2 Using a medium-sized bowl and whisk, mix the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Step 3 Break the eggs into a bowl and beat lightly, then add milk. Combine then add little by little the butter/sugar mix, beating well after each addition. Step 4 Add the flour little by little to the egg and butter mix, folding gently then add the lemon rind and combine. Step 5 Pour the mixture into the baking and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until firm to the touch or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean.
