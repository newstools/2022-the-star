The national trials for the Commonwealth Games, earlier scheduled for this weekend, has been postponed to June 24-25. The trials, planned for Moi Stadium, Kasarani, will now be merged with the trials for the World Championship to come up with one team to represent the country in both competitions. Making the announcement, Athletics Kenya president Jack Tuwei said the decision was arrived at after deliberations with the National Olympic Committee-Kenya. “We have to understand that the Covid-19 pandemic affected the sporting events in the world. These two championships come close to each other and therefore we need to have a strong team capable of representing the country well at both events,” Tuwei said. He said they will continue to work concertedly to ensure the smooth sailing of the selection process. “The trials earlier scheduled for this weekend have therefore been postponed. We have been in deliberations with Nock and are still discussing. They are the ones to whom we will hand over the team for the Commonwealth and so it is very important that they are involved,” he said. Speaking at the same time, Nock president Paul Tergat assured athletes and all sportspersons that they will be afforded opportunities to qualify for the major assignments. “AK and Nock will work together to prepare a strong team for the Commonwealth and World Championships. We want to offer all athletes the best opportunity to qualify,” Tergat said.
