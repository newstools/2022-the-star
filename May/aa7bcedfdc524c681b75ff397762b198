Supporters of Moiben MP Silas Tiren carried out protests in Eldoret after the IEBC gazetted his name as an aspirant for a ward rep seat instead of a parliamentary seat. Tiren is defending his seat in Uasin Gishu as an independent aspirant but the IEBC listed him as an aspirant for the Moiben ward seat. The MP camped at the IEBC to have the issue rectified even as his supporters protested in Eldoret. The supporters led by Julius Korir threatened to storm the IEBC offices in Eldoret to have the mistake rectified. "We ask the IEBC to ensure our MP is property gazetted as a parliamentary aspirant and not as a ward representative," one of the supporters said. Korir said Tiren was a second time MP and claimed that the mistake would confuse some of his supporters. Tiren is vying against the UDA nominee for the area Professor Phyllis Bartoo and former MP Joseph Lagat who is also vying as an independent aspirant. Tiren's supporters carried placards demanding quick action by the IEBC. The MP who is also Chairman of the parliamentary committee on agriculture confirmed that he was at the IEBC seeking to have the problem rectified. "I hope the matter is rectified urgently before time runs out," Tiren said. His supporters threatened to go to court to stop the elections in Moiben if the mistake was not rectified by the IEBC.
