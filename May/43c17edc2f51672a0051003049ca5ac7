The Kiambu government will give farmers pesticides to control armyworms that are destroying maize crops, Governor James Nyoro has said. He said his government is waiting for the ongoing rains to subside so that they can start controlling the worms. "The pesticides cannot be applied when it is raining. We are waiting for the rains to halt so that our extension agriculture officers can start teaching people how to deal with these worms," Nyoro said. The governor said the most affected regions are Ndeiya and Ngoliba. He said farmers have been complaining of massive losses due to these pests. Nyoro spoke in Gikuni village, Kabete constituency, on Tuesday where he distributed maize seeds to residents. The governor said the seeds suit the region's environment, saying they mature within three months. He said his government has set aside Sh1.2 billion to support farmers with seeds, pesticides, fertilisers and other inputs. Nyoro said his government wants every homestead to be food secure. Residents praised Nyoro's administration for the support. "The variety of seeds he has been assisting us with has no season," resident Salome Wanjiku said. "We plant them anytime and within three months, the maize are ready for harvesting. If leaders come up with such strategies, I'm sure no family will ever sleep hungry. It is a strategy to fight poverty and hunger," she said. Edited by A.N
