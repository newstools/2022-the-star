Twitter has announced that all spaces hosts and co-hosts can access full Spaces analytics for both Android and iOS. This is after testing them with selected creators over the last month. Twitter spaces is a new tab on the Twitter application that allows users to engage in live, unfiltered audio conversations hosted in Spaces (Chat rooms). The analytics tools include data on the number of people that tuned in to your broadcast, the total speakers in each session, replay counts, duration, and more. In addition, Twitter is also testing a feature that will tweet out a Space card once hosts start a Space. Twitter says the new feature will make it easier for users to engage with and share the Space. “When some Hosts start a Space, a Space card will be sent as a Tweet so listeners can reply, engage, and share…straight from the Space! We hope it makes it easier to see and participate in the conversation,” they said. The feature is now being tested on iOS and Android.
