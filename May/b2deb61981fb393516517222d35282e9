Peak demand for electricity in the country has risen by close to 30mw in the last six months, according to the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). The rise is as a result of full resumption of business by industries after two years of interruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic which forced many industries to close or scale down operations. According to the latest power generation and dispatch report from the authority, the country’s new peak demand stands at 2,065MW up from 2,036MW recorded in November 2021. The report notes that Kengen has played a crucial role in providing renewable energy sources with geothermal energy making the greatest contribution. The EPRA report notes that the country’s energy gross demand registered a 1.2 percent growth to record a new peak of 36,825.78MWh up from 36,380.63MWh in November last year. “The total amount of electricity generated by KenGen through its hydro power stations exceeded the National Control Centre dispatch projections by 111.08MW, denoting a 1.2 percent increase,” reads the report. The EPRA statement contained in Kengen's weekly review report, shows that electricity was mostly drawn from renewable energy sources. Kengen MD Rebecca Miano said the report reflects the firm's ongoing strategic efforts to meet the country’s growing demand through harnessing Kenya’s rich renewable energy sources. Gitaru, Kindaruma, Kamburu, and Kiambere Power Stations were among the hydro power stations that exceeded the projected power generation output. Speaking earlier, Kengen General Manager Mary Maalu announced an ambitious programme to pump close to 400Mw into the national grid in the next five years phasing out thermal power. She said power demand in the country was on the rise as more companies and consumers sought electricity.
