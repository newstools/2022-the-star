The newly constituted Football Kenya Federation Transition Committee has hinted at the possibility of bringing league sponsors on board. In a letter dated Wednesday 18, the Transition Committee's head of secretariat Lindah Oguttu invited local clubs cutting across five major competitions in the country for a meeting scheduled for May 23 with sponsorship highlighting the agenda. “The FKF Transition Committee would like to invite you for a meeting Monday, 23rd May 2022 at the Kasarani Ball room from 9 am,” read the letter in part. Oguttu said the stakeholders would deliberate on the future and commercialization of football in the country as well as engagement with potential sponsors. The development could provide some hope for local community teams already grappling with grave financial challenges. The TC has found itself at loggerheads with Mathare United honcho Bob Munro who accused it of accelerating the club's downfall by failing to disburse funds in good time. On Tuesday, the Transition Committee said it is not obliged to aid any top flight club, head of leagues and competitions Ali Amour has said. Amour was reacting to assertions made by Mathare United founder and chairman Bob Munro who castigated the retired judge Aaron Ringera led Committee for unjustifiably suspending and eventually relegating the Slum Boys from the Kenyan Premier League. In a letter penned on Tuesday to Oguttu, Munro placed their woes at the feet of the defunct Caretaker Committee, saying it failed to disburse funds to clubs in appropriate time. However, in an exclusive interview on Wednesday, Amour said Munro was being dishonest by implying that the Committee owed the club financial favors. “The club owner runs the club. They need to have their own funds and we are only meant to give them a stipend,” said Amour. “We were not obliged to give them any money and it's improper for them to imply so. Editing by Tony Mballa
