Treasury has disbursed more than Sh286 billion of equitable share allocation to counties this financial year. At the Intergovernmental Budget and Economic Council (IBEC) meeting chaired by Deputy President William Ruto at his Karen residence on Tuesday, Treasury said the pending amount of Sh85 billion was being fast-tracked for payment. Turkana Governor Josphat Nanok who was in the meeting said the timely disbursement of the funds would smoothen service delivery by counties. In attendance were Governor Nanok, PS Devolution Julius Korir, Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakang’o, representatives from the National Treasury, Ministry of Devolution and County Executive Committee Members. Ruto told the meeting that there was an urgent need to address the issue of pending bills by counties as 60 per cent of them constitute pensions. “The Devolution Ministry will convene a meeting with stakeholders to discuss this problematic issue with a view of resolving it and eliminating unnecessary penalties,” he said. The Controller of Budget disclosed that Own Source Revenue was a sleeping giant that can unlock the economic potential of counties. “We have partnered with the United Nations Capital Development Fund to enhance counties’ generation of own revenues that will also help them tackle the issue of pending bills,” said Dr Nyakang’o.
