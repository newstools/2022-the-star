An image of  Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior supposedly meeting "Kenya Kwanza Leaders" over an alleged possibility of working together ahead of the August 9, elections was taken in 2020. The picture which had Kilonzo Jnr, Elegyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, Johnson Sakaja(Nairobi), Aaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) and Cleophas Malala (Kakamega) has been going viral on social media since Monday evening. Some of those who shared the image claimed Senator  Kilonzo Junior was dispatched by Wiper Leader Kalonzo Musyoka to negotiate with Kenya Kwanza leaders over the possibility of working together. Fact-checker has however established that the picture was taken on August 15, 2020. The group was at a restaurant in Nairobi when the picture was taken. The picture was taken even before the Kenya Kwanza Alliance came into existence hence the meeting was not about sealing a political deal. Though most of the leaders are all in Kenya Kwanza currently except Kilonzo Junior, their meeting was no doubt pegged on a different matter and not Kalonzo joining Ruto's team. Kenyans should therefore not fall to misleading reports being told about the picture.
