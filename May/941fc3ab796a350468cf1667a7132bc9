A man who was saved from imprisonment by former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko after he pleaded guilty to shoplifting is now in police custody for committing a similar offence. Alvin Chivondo, now alleged to be a serial shoplifter, was put in custody on Thursday after he stole from a supermarket along Ronald Ngala Street in Nairobi CBD. Chivondo is accused of stealing maize flour from the supermarket. Police are now holding him at Central Police Station pending arraignment. This comes weeks after Milimani Chief Magistrate Wendy Kagendo handed him a one-year prison sentence or a fine of Sh100,000. The sentence was handed after he pleaded guilty to the offence of stealing 5 kgs of rice, 5 litres of cooking oil, 2 kgs of sugar, and tea leaves, all valued at Ksh3,165. The man's plight went viral prompting Sonko to come to his rescue and paid a Sh100,000 fine. Sonko said that he made the decision as his normal way of reaching out to troubled people. "Many Kenyans are living in squalor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many will say that it’s PR but I like assisting people, that’s has been my passion since I was in high school in Kwale boys," Sonko said. He added that: "I have also promised to give him a one-month food stock plus offer him a job as well."
