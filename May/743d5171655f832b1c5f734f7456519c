KCB women's team beat Nairobi Prisons 3-0 (25-15,25-15,25-12) as the fourth leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation National League ended at the Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. Prisons are yet to win this season after firing blanks in their two weekend matches. The wardresses lacked rhythm in their play leaving coach Salome Wanjala frustrated. "The players made silly individual mistakes and the chemistry was totally missing. We played KCB in a friendly match recently and we took two sets from them and it’s unfortunate that my players failed to emulate their recent performance. They looked of out of place," a visibly disgusted Wanjala narrated. However, KCB coach Japheth Munala, said they ought to gather momentum to ensure a fruitful end to the season. “We are happy we have collected six points and we hope to extend the good run as the season gathers momentum,” offered Munala. Munala made just one change in the lineup that beat Kenya Defence Forces 3-0 on Saturday. Budding setter Immaculate Nekesa was preferred over Faith Imodia. The bankers led in the first and second-time outs 8-3 and 16-9 as Nairobi Prisons struggled to get their footing. The setting was a problematic department for Prisons with the duo of Hilda Jepkosgei and Emily Khisa tested before Wanjala settled on the experienced Florence Bosire. Mercy Moim was a class act for KCB as the bankers bagged the first set 25-15. Prisons’ poor coordination and miscommunication made work easy for KCB as they bagged points with an easy lead 23-13 before they took the second set 25-15. The going got tougher for Prisons, who threw in the towel to lose the last set 25-12.
