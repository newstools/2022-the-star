The United Democratic Alliance will on Sunday hold fresh nominations for Nairobi South Ward in Starehe Constituency. The party had conducted primaries in the ward on April 14 where incumbent Member of County Assembly Waithera Chege emerged the winner. According to the party's National Elections Board chairman Anthony Mwaura, the party will also conduct nominations in Kiambaa Constituency. “The nomination exercise shall take place on 8th May 2022 between 8.00 am to 5.00 pm at the IEBC designated polling centers,” Mwaura said. John Wanjiku is the current Kiambaa MP after he clinched the seat in a by-election in July 2021 on a UDA ticket. On April 16, the UDA party said it would repeat the nomination exercise in Starehe Constituency after chaos disrupted the exercise. It said it would hold new nominations in Embakasi East, Mathare and Dagoretti North for MP aspirants, as well as Starehe, Roysambu and Kamukunji. Nominations in Starehe and Kamukunji  did not take place after the exercise was marred by violence.
