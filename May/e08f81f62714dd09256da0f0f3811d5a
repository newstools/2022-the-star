A Police Patrol team from Turbi Police Station and their Quick Response Unit counterparts from Mudhe Shurr in Turbi Sub-County recovered two firearms and 51 goats. This followed an operation launched after a case of theft was reported at Laisamis Police Station, on Thursday. According to the National Police Service, patrols have been intensified in the larger Marsabit County, in search for illegal arms. "Besides the objectives to seize illegal arms and restore sustainable peace in the disturbed areas of Marsabit, security officers deployed in the area will continue to interdict other acts of criminality including the trafficking of drugs and theft of livestock," a NPS statement said. The handing over of the recovered items which included four rounds of ammunition to Laisamis Police Station was witnessed by the Officer in charge of Station, Turbi. The recovery of the 54 cows was made possible with the cooperation from community members and area administrators who provided information that led to arrests and recoveries. In another similar operation, the Multi-agency security team that is conducting 'Operation Rejesha Amani Marsabit' while on mobile patrol at Harondel and Bubisa Location, arrested and interrogated four suspects who led to the recovery of one G-3 rifle with one magazine and four rounds of (7.62x51) mm of live ammunition.
