Amber Ray's Sierra Leonean basketballer ex-boyfriend Kabba has allegedly accused the socialite of using charms to try to trap him. Through his Instastories, Kabba said he fortunately managed to escape. "The juju didn't stay long on me, thanks God for helping me." Kabba had earlier explained that he broke up with Amber Ray since she was not ready to be a wife. He swore never to date women from Amber's homeland. "I wonder why a lot of people out there think that it is only men who use women. Women are very, very dangerous," he wrote. "Right now, Kambaland is the place I will never want to visit in my life. There is something about that place that is not right."
