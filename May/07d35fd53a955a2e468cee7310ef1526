The High Court has barred IEBC from clearing former Kiambu CEC Karungo wa Thang'wa to run for the Senate seat in the August 9 elections. Thang'wa is the UDA candidate in the Kiambu senatorial race. The court ruled the senate aspirant can only be cleared after a case challenging his eligibility to contest is heard and determined. A petition seeking to bar Thang'wa from being cleared was filed by Kelvin Njui Wangari. IEBC, EACC and Thang'wa were respondents. "Pending further orders of the expanded Bench, the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission is hereby prohibited from clearing the 1st Respondent herein, Paul Karungo Thang'wa to vie as a candidate for any elective office at the 9th August 2022 general elections and/or printing ballot papers bearing his name and/or symbol." reads a ruling by Justice Mrima. Thang'wa 's impeachment while serving as Kiambu CEC formed the ground of petition seeking him blocked from the race. Justice Mrima at the same time referred the matter to the Chief Justice who will make a determination on the matter alongside many other related and or similar cases. "This matter is hereby referred to the Hon. Chief Justice to be dealt with alongside the other related matters by the expanded Bench of the High Court." Former Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko is among leaders whose petition on eligibility to vie lies in the hands of the Chief Justice.
