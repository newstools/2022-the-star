President Uhuru Kenyatta will hit the ground in June to campaign for ODM leader Raila Odinga, his allies have said. The president is reported that he will be commissioning projects in the region and also woo voters to back Raila and his running mate Martha Karua. Kieni MP and Jubilee Director of Elections Kanini Kega told Nation that Uhuru will pitch tents in the Mt Kenya region in June and July for campaigns. He said the schedule for the tour will be unveiled in due course even as it emerged that the tour will come after the Madaraka day celebrations. Kega told the local daily that the tour will begin from Nyeri before proceeding to the rest of Mt Kenya counties. “His countrywide campaigns will start with the mountain. We do not just want him to the campaign. The President will also commission projects,” Kega said as quoted by Nation. “President Kenyatta will also show us which direction to take. It is obvious Mt Kenya is with Karua. She is the person we will oscillate around when the boss leaves the office." The President will meet a host of Mt Kenya leaders from the region after his Switzerland tour to plan his visit. Gatanga  MP Joseph Nduati told the daily that they have received an alert of the meeting. The developments come even as officials close to Uhuru are reported to have earlier said the President will not be attending the political campaigns. The Kenya Kwanza Alliance led by Deputy President William Ruto welcomed the report terming it a "wise move". "I have heard the President saying he will not be on the ground to campaign for Raila. I had started asking myself how I will take on him because he is our president and we respect him. Keeping off from the campaign will now mean we will not  disrespect the president."
