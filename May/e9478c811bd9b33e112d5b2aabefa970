Singer Avril says Kenyans show love to their artistes when they die. Avril made a comeback to the music industry over the weekend with a new song 'Danger' after missing for close to a year. However, Kenyans didn't support her as expected because in eight hours, the song had only 796 views on YouTube. This despite her having more than 1.8 million followers on Instagram and more than 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. Kenyan fashion designer and stylist Nimrod Nick asked fans to support Avril, reminding them she had produced hits before. Avril responded, "Don't worry, when I die, the songs I've done over time will trend at least for a while. "Maybe even get love. Never worry. Thank you for the post, the mockery and the love."
