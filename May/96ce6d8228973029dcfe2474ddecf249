The Boni minority community on Monday received food donations from the government of Kuwait in conjunction with the county government of Lamu. Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha hosted Kuwait Ambassador to Kenya Qusai Rashed Al Farhan in Lamu before he led the exercise in Boni areas. The two leaders visited the Boni community in Kiangwe, Basuba ward, for a food distribution exercise that will benefited over 1,000 people in both Kiangwe, Mararani, Basuba and Mangai. The collaboration between the Lamu governor's office and the Kuwait Embassy aims to protect the vulnerable Awer community who have been grappling with the effects of severe drought. This comes several weeks after residents of Basuba ward were forced to migrate to Kiangwe area, a neighbouring village after a serious food and water shortage hit their areas. Last week, Governor Twaha announced plans to stop the construction of the official governor’s residence and instead direct the funds towards a preliminary plan to donate food to residents across the county to counter post Covid -19 and drought challenges. Lamu is among counties hard hit by drought in the country with hundreds of acres of crops drying up at immature stages. More than 30,000 livestock were lost to the drought which has also occasioned the food and water shortages being experienced across the region. “Despite the rainy season starting, most residents are still without enough food to sustain them until crops mature, as a county, we have decided to channel funds aimed at construction of governor’s residential to fund food donation to Lamu residents," Twaha said. Last week, Red Cross became the latest organisation to donate to the Boni where residents received blankets, nets and Taperlinks along with other basic needs.   -Edited by SKanyara
