The Ministry of Environment has received Sh400 million to support four cities manage medical waste. Nakuru, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nairobi will benefit from the funds following reports of increased amount of medical waste since Covid-19 was reported. The ministry and United Nations Development Programme has donated an incinerator and assorted equipment to Naivasha subcounty hospital to deal with the hazardous waste. According to Environment PS Chris Kiptoo, government and partners are keen to address the issue of medical waste in public hospitals. “The management of medical waste continues to be a major challenge and through partners Nakuru will benefit from incinerators and assorted equipment worth Sh30 million,” Kiptoo said on Monday. Kiptoo said that the ministry had worked on a bill that sought to ban all dumpsites which are sources of pollution. “Under the new bill families will be required to sort out their waste before it’s collected as one way of reducing pollution,” he said. Nakuru Deputy Governor Dr Eric Korir termed the donation timely and useful as the county was generating 52 tonnes of medical waste every month. He said despite producing a lot of waste, the county didn’t have any challenges dealing with it as they had invested in waste management Korir said that the new equipment would help address the number of diseases brought about by waste. “Before the hazardous waste was ferried to Nakuru for disposal but this will now be dealt with through the new incinerator,” he said. UNDP deputy representative Ms Mandisa Mashologu said they were keen to expand the programme for more counties to benefit. “The donated incinerator will go a long way in supporting nearby health centres as we move in to protect the environment,” she said. Others who spoke were the chief officer in charge of Health Dr Daniel Wainaina who said the equipment will help in dealing with effluents from the medical waste. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
