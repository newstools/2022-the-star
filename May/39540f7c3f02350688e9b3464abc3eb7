Rangers' captain James Tavernier is "devastated" after the team faltered at their final Europa League hurdle with a cruel 5-4 penalty shootout defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in Seville. The game went into penalties after the sides drew 1-1 at regular time. Rangers opened the scores with a 57th minute strike through Joe Aribo before Frankfurt equalized in the 69th minute through Rafael Santos Borre Maury. Tavernier said the loss was tough to take as it came through penalties after they had taken the lead and conceded a goal they shouldn't have conceded. He however said he is proud of everyone associated with the Rangers club.
