The United Nation's humanitarian affairs agency (Ocha) says the world is not paying enough attention to crises beyond the war in Ukraine including a devastating drought in East Africa. The head of the organisation, Martin Griffiths, made the appeal after visiting Turkana in north-west Kenya where food is extremely scarce after a lengthy period without rainfall. People there are suffering from malnutrition with some left too weak to stand or walk. The UN World Food Program says 20 million people across East Africa are at risk of severe hunger.
