There are no talks between my United Democratic Party leader (UDP) Cyrus Jirongo and ODM leader Raila Odinga for me to shelve my governor ambitions, Vihiga Senator George Khaniri says. He said reports about talks between UDP and ODM are false and manufactured by rivals scared of facing him in August. The senator was reacting to a statement on social media that there are ongoing talks between UDP and ODM to have him shelve his ambition. “My plans are still on. My supporters don’t be confused with the misleading reports. I am on the ballot seeking to be elected as Vihiga governor,” Khaniri said. Khaniri will be facing the incumbent Governor Wilber Ottichilo of ODM, former governor Moses Akaranga of PPOK, Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi of ANC, and Francis Ominde of FPK. Deputy Governor Patrick Saisi has pulled out of the race to deputize Moses Akaranga of PPOK after his The Equitable party was disqualified from participating in this general election. Initially, Akaranga had settled on Paul Mbuni as his running mate. The two haven’t spoken to the Media despite efforts to reach them. “All candidates who were to vie on The Equitable Party are now going as independent candidates because our party has not lasted for six months to participate in this general election,” Butiya said. Nixon Butiya was eyeing Hamisi MP Seat on The Equitable Party. Former National Assembly Speaker who had joined the race for Vihiga governor will have to shelve his ambitions after Raila Odinga had proposed him for the senate speaker position. Khaniri who has already picked Engineer Jerald Samoyo as his deputy is banking on his political experience to unseat governor Ottichilo. Initially, he had called on former Governor Moses Akaranga and Sabatia MP Alfred Agoi to shelve their ambition and support him to unseat the incumbent.
