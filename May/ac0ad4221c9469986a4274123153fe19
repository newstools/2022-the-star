Kenya Kwanza presidential nominee William Ruto on Sunday named Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate, ending speculation on who it will be. Celebrations and disappointments were inevitable but Ruto has his reasons for picking Gachagua despite him being dogged by court cases All eyes are now on Azimio presidential nominee Raila Odinga to name his deputy. Once the two formations are done with this task, the country will be entering the campaign home stretch. However it has been disappointing that so far, the campaigns have been dominated by name-calling and mudslinging. What the coalitions stand for has been completely lost in all this. We hope that the presidential debates being organised by the media will put the candidates to task to expound on the various declarations they have made at political rallies. The panelists must ask the hard questions that Kenyans cannot ask in the charged public rallies. The debates must be aired on all public, private and community media outlets to reach as many Kenyans as possible to help them make informed choices ahead of the August 9 election. The stakes are very high in this election and the media must tread carefully so that either by omission or commission they do not lead the country down the garden path.
