Tanzanian socialite Hamisa Mobetto has denied using using filters on her photos. The mother of two in an interview with Tanzanian blogs said she does not think filters can completely alter how a person looks. "I'm very lucky I meet people face to face and they see that I look like my online pictures. Many of them comment that they thought I use filters," she said. "Social media is like a field. If you use social media for good, then you will land jobs. If you use it without being strategic then the results are disastrous." Hamisa also talked about her upcoming EP. "I have been in talks with my management about it and next week I will release my EP. It will be my first-ever EP."
