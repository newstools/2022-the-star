Reigning champions, Tusker, have a perfect opportunity to take the Kenyan Premier League title hunt to the wire when they come up against Nzoia Sugar at Ruaraka Grounds this afternoon. The brewers are currently second on the log with 56 points and a win over the millers will fire them to a point within leaders Kakamega Homeboyz. Homeboyz suffered a dent in their quest for a dream maiden title on Saturday, after playing out to one-all draw against Gor Mahia at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Tusker come up against a side fresh from a seven-match winless streak and, perhaps, bagging maximum might just as well be a walk in the park. The brewers experienced a torrid start to the season but managed to put their house in order just in time to spring back into serious contention. Coach Robert Matano and his charges will look to replicate their exploits in the preceding season where their splendid form saw them grab a double. On August 22, an impressive run in the season fired them to their 12th Premier League title and on September 23, they lifted the season-opening Super Cup after beating FKF Cup champions Gor Mahia 8-7 on post match penalties after a 1-1 stalemate in regulation time.
