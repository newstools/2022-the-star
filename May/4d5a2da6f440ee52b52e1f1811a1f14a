Bungoma-based Kenya Premier League side, Nzoia Sugar are looking into ways to strengthen the team and at the same time stop the exodus of their key players. The club's chairman Evans Kadenge said his priority is to ensure Nzoia get out of the relegation zone by ending the season on a high. "We have struggled a lot for the last four seasons as a result of disorientation due to the exit of star players and we are keen to change that," he noted. "We will have a well-structured system that will bind the players to long-term contracts as we seek to keep away poachers," he said. "I want to appreciate the role being played by our sponsors—Nzoia Sugar Company, as well as our loyal fans. However, I also want to urge other well-wishers to come on board and support the team so that we can restore our lost glory," he noted. The chairman singled out the playing unit and the technical bench for praise after steadying the ship that was almost sinking. He urged his charges to treat the remaining matches as a final in a bid to survive relegation. Nzoia Sugar are currently in position 14 with 28 points after playing 27 matches so far.
