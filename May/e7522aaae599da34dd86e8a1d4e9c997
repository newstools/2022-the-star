Tanzanian singer Nandy and her fiancé Bill Nass are in Turkey, shopping. The two are said to be shopping for wedding attire ahead of their anticipated nuptials in July. The two lovebirds shared with their fans how they spent the day fitting different designer wedding gowns. Speaking to Wasafi, Bill Nass said everything is planned for July. "I am ready to be a family man," he said, adding that he does not fancy weddings and that he is doing it to please Nandy. Nandy is also alleged to be expectant but Nas denied the claims. He said he wishes his child to be born in a family setup. "I wish to get a child after marriage and that is all that I am planning. She is not pregnant."
