Bernard Mufutu has been named Ulinzi Warriors head coach ahead of the 2022 season. According to the players’ data submitted to the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF), Mufutu will be assisted by Esther Butali. It was not immediately clear what role the team’s former coach, William Balozi will play, if any, going forward. A former Ulinzi guard, Mufutu’s immediate responsibility will be to lead the nine-time champions back to the helm once again. The team got a huge boost with the inclusion of Kenya Morans playmaker Victor Bosire in the 19-man list that will, however, miss Joseph Khaemba and James Mwangi. Bosire, alongside Khaemba and Mwangi returned to the lineup during the playoffs after missing some action including the Basketball Africa League (BAL) qualifiers. Veteran shooting forward Ancette Wafula, who, at 45, continues to defy age, maintains his spot in the team. The Warriors still have five more slots to fill in their roster. It is believed these positions are reserved for new signings. The soldiers open their campaign at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium on June 4 against debutants Zetech University Titans. Ulinzi, who lost their title on a 3-2 basis to Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) last month, have maintained Stephen Bartilol as the team manager. A total of 20 matches are on card in all categories on the opening weekend of the Kenya National Basketball Federation League (KNBL).
