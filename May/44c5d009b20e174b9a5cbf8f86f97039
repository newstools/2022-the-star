Ugandan singer Bobi Wine and President Yoweri Museveni's son Muhoozi Kainerugaba have engaged in a public spat over their presidential bids. Their comments mocking each other have split Ugandans down the middle. Muhoozi shared a meme showing how he and his 'brother' were competing to fill the shoes that Yoweri will leave. He captioned it, "Me and my young brother Kabobi arguing over who can fill my father's shoes! Thanks to the best artist in Uganda." The country will hold its next presidential elections in 2026. Bobi Wine said, "I am not your brother and I'm not competing for your father's shoes. You're entitled to M7's shoes, cows and even his hat. One mistake you make is to think that Uganda is one of your father's properties for you to inherit."
