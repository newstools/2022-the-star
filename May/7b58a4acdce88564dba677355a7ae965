A boda boda rider died on the spot when his motorcycle collided head-on with a car at Ngarariga, Limuru, along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. The rider was transporting pears to Limuru town when the fatal accident happened, creating a traffic snarl-up. Confirming the accident, Limuru subcounty police commander Eilen Mola said the rider's body was taken to Uphome Funeral Home while wreckages of the car and motorcycle were towed to Tigoni police station. She said they have launched investigations into the cause of the accident. "I appeal to parents whose children ride motorcycles to ensure they have been taught well. We need to reduce fatalities that can be avoided," Mola said. A boda boda rider, Francis Gicheru, said some young riders ride carelessly so as to be noticed. " We have warned so many. Those who do not heed our advice we leave them alone," he said. Another trader, Joan Njeri, asked the government to come up with road safety campaigns and ensure riders in all towns participate so as to be educated how to responsible. "The training must touch on how to observe traffic rules, how to take care of themselves, hygiene and how to speak to their customers," Njeri said. The training should also include "how to save, and most importantly, to realise that the society needs in the years to come."  (edited by Amol Awuor)
