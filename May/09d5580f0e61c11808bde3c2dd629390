Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga have paid warm tributes to the Kenyan workers as they mark the Labour day celebrations across the country. President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to lead the celebrations at Nyayo Stadium this Sunday. In his message, Ruto acknowledged the important role the Kenyan workers have impacted the economy saying they have made the country what it is. "To workers and hustlers: We recognize your toil, sweat and hard work. You are the reason that Kenya is where and what it is today. You are the engine to get us there. God bless you," he said. On his part, Raila also shared similar sentiments to that of the DP regarding the building of the nation. Raila went further and pledged workers equitable pay in his administration in the event he is elected President in the August 9 polls. "A nation is nothing without a workforce that feels fulfilled, secure, and appreciated. The Azimo administration will ensure that all Kenyans will receive adequate pay for their efforts to ensure their dignity is upheld. Happy Labour Day" Raila said. Uhuru is expected to lead his last labour day celebrations given that he is exiting the office after the August 9, polls. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli on Saturday said the function will be purely about workers. He noted that there will be no politicking during the celebrations adding that workers' affairs will be the only agenda The celebrations come at a time when Kenyans are witnessing a sporadic rise in the prices of basic commodities. Most Kenyan workers are also facing a salary increase freeze. Many employers have lamented over the tough business environment occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic effects as the reason why they can't offer  a salary rise to their workers.
