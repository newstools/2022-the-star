Following their unofficial wedding in Las Vegas last month the reality TV star and Blink-182 drummer legally tied the knot at a courthouse in Santa Barbara, California on Sunday. The couple was snapped on the street in wedding attire, leading to reports of their nuptials, and the newlyweds confirmed the news on Instagram on Monday. Kourtney shared a photo of them making out in a vintage car affixed with a "just married" sign and tin cans, followed by snaps of them posing in the vehicle and on the steps of what appears to be the courthouse.
