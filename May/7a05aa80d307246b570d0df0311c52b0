The Garissa government has launched the Gender and Disaster Risk Management policy. County secretary Abdi Ali and WFP country director Lauren Landis presided over the ceremony held at a Garissa hotel on Saturday. Ali said the Gender Policy will ensure that the rights of women, men, boys and girls are promoted, protected and realised on equal measure. He said the Disaster Risk Management Policy on the other hand will help in preparedness, protection, prevention, recovery and provision of relief aid to victims of droughts, floods, conflicts and human and livestock epidemics. Ali said the DRM policy will also help build resilience in communities prone to disasters, enable fast response and prevent risks of disasters. Garissa is the seventh county to launch the Gender Policy. It is also the fourth to launch a Disaster Risk Management Policy. The World Food Programme provided technical assistance and supported comprehensive consultations by relevant stakeholders in the development of the two policies. Landis said the launch of the policy document is a move in the right direction and will provide a sectoral-based framework towards attainment of gender equality and women empowerment. “The DRM policy is a major step towards achieving sustainable development. This will be realised if disaster risk management is integrated in development planning by all sectors of the county,” she said. Present were county attorney Ismail Dabar, deputy director of Gender Ahmed Hante, assistant director Special Programmes Abdullahi Yussuf and WFP Garissa Office head Yussuf Ali.
