Traditional Kenyan football giants AFC Leopards and Gor Mahia on Sunday benefited immensely from President Uhuru Kenyatta's generosity after receiving Sh12 million each. Azimio La Umoja presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, brought the development to light while addressing ecstatic fans who had gathered outside the Moi Stadium Kasarani after the Mashemeji derby pitting AFC Leopards against Gor Mahia. The two leaders comprised the crowd that witnessed the 94th edition of the Kenya's most popular football showpiece that ended in a one-all draw. "Each of the teams will get Sh2 million that will go to the players. The president has also given a further Sh20 million that will be shared equally by both clubs. The money will help them cater for their remaining fixtures,” Raila said. Raila also said there are plans to hire well qualified coaches who will be tasked with raising local football standards to international levels. “We have agreed to engage professional coaches who will help nurture local talent. We need to produce quality players like Victor Wanyama who plied his trade in England for Tottenham Hotspurs and who is currently in Canada," Raila said. Editing by Tony Mballa
