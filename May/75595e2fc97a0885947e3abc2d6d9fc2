President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday expressed the need for Kenya, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to rejuvenate their bilateral cooperation for the mutual benefit of the people of the two countries. He spoke at State House, Nairobi, when he received a delegation sent by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The UAE delegation was led by the Gulf nation’s Minister of State Sheikh Nahyan bin Shakhboot Al Nahyanh, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces among other UAE officials. “The objective of this meeting is to see how we can strengthen those areas of cooperation that have not been strong. We should also explore new areas of cooperation for the mutual benefit of our people,” Uhuru said. The meeting, which reviewed the status of the implementation of the economic and technical cooperation between the two countries, was a follow up to the president’s working visit to the Gulf nation in February, where he met and held talks with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi among other engagements. Among the areas reviewed during the meeting at the meeting in State House included cooperation in bilateral trade, investment, finance and banking, tourism, agriculture, ICT, energy and petroleum. Head of Public Service Dr Josph Kinyua and Cabinet Secretaries Ukur Yatani (National Treasury), Monica Juma (Energy), Betty Maina (Trade), Peter Munya (Agriculture) and Joe Mucheru (ICT) attended the meeting. Also, National Treasury Principal Secretary Julius Muia, and his Energy counterpart Andrew Kamau attended the meeting.
