United Democratic Alliance vice chairman Kipruto Arap Kirwa has dumped the Deputy President William Ruto-led party for Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja outfit. Speaking at the Azimio la Umoja rally held at Sirisia Market in Bungoma County on Sunday Kirwa announced that he had resigned from the UDA party as its vice chairman. "From today I Kipruto Arap Kirwa have resigned as UDA vice chairman and I have resigned because I have seen how democracy is going to be suppressed if we allow the other side," he said. An earlier tweet from Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa led party Democratic Action Party of Kenya (Dap-K) that is an affiliate of party in the Azimio coalition said Kirwa will be received by Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and Martha Karua. According to the former Cherangany MP, his decision to leave UDA has been a two week journey that started soon after the DP and Raila chose their running mates. He noted that after 13 days of thinking he decided to call Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua and asked her to be the one to announce his coming to the Azimio la Umoja camp.
