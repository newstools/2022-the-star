The poor away record is worrying newbies Bunyore Starlets ahead of their Kenya Women's Premier League match against Gaspo. Bunyore made an impressive start to life in the Premier League and were a comfortable eighth on the table in the 12-team league in the first leg. However, their performance dwindled in the second half of the season with just one win in their last seven matches. They find themselves in 10th place with 15 points, a demoralising turnaround for Bunyore who were firmly in control of their future. With just four matches to play, they have everything to play for. Even their perfect home record at Mumboha grounds which saw them scalp defending champions Thika Queens has been tarnished by damaging losses to Ulinzi Starlets (3-0) and Kisumu All Starlet (2-0). Worryingly, Bunyore's blunt attack has failed to score in their last seven matches—setting another unwanted record in the league. Their 1-0 loss against Kayole last weekend officially ushered them to the relegation zone that also has tail-enders Kangemi Ladies (six points), Kisumu (13), and Kayole 16. "We have really struggled to impose ourselves on the away matches thus far and the poor results are a bitter pill to swallow," coach Zachariah Amakhanga remarked. "We were just unlucky against Kayole. We had at least nine clear-cut chances to kill off the tie but the ball could not just go in," he noted. He said Bunyore need more big-game performance in order to rediscover their Spark. "They also require more killers and a rearguard and a shot stopper who can thwart Gaspo this weekend," he added. "We are doing everything we can to better our results in the remaining matches. We are not in a crisis yet but confidence in the playing unit seems to be fading away especially on our travels," he added. "We have to live up to the pressure of playing without our supporters."
