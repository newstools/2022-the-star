Victor Omune was the toast of the day, notching up a brace as AFC Leopards put up a vicious battle to edge FC Talanta 3-2 in an action-packed Kenyan Premier League thriller at Nyayo Stadium on Saturday. Omune grabbed the opener from the spot barely seven minutes into the proceedings, after an overzealous Shela Mandela sent him tumbling down in the area. Tedian Esilaba announced his return from a long spell of injury in grand fashion when he rose high to nod in Leopards' second goal from Brian Wanyama's enticing delivery. Unfazed, Talanta made incessant inroads into their opponents defensive third and it wasn't long before they reaped a lush harvest from their resilience. With only ten minutes of play left, the hard-battling coach Ken Kenyatta tutored lads struck twice in quick succession. A goalmouth melee led to a spot kick with substitute Brian Yakhama gladly stepping up to reduce the deficit. Then 60 seconds later, Kevintom Machika pounced on a loose ball in a strategic position to draw the visitors level, much to the chagrin of the home fans who went mute momentarily. Any hope Talanta had of picking an away point from their opponents' turf went up in flames when Omune grabbed a last-gasp winner in stoppage time — the screamer sending the Isukuti beats to a crescendo and the fans into an ecstacy.
