Crepes are paper-thin cakes that are almost similar to pancakes, the only difference is the crepe does not require a raising agent. That is a baking powder or a baking soda. This means crepes are thin and flat while pancakes are thicker and fluffy. Pancakes are often served in stacks and are an ideal go-to for breakfast. Crepes can be served with beef or chicken as wraps. Crepes are generally served folded or rolled with various sweets and savory fillings like strawberries, spinach, or bananas. Depending on the filling ingredients, crepes can be served as dessert and as a main dish. They are however larger in size compared to pancakes and thinner. Crepes and pancakes actually taste the same the difference is the size and preparation method. Ingredients Preparation Step 1: In a bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter/oil. Beat until a smooth medium consistency is achieved Step 2: Over medium-high heat. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan until hot. Pour or scoop the paste onto the pan. Using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe, tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the paste coats the surface evenly. Step 3: Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Step 4: Add desired fillings like desiccated coconut, bananas, syrup, and others as you please. Step 5: Serve hot with hot chocolate or cold drink.
