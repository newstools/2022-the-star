Tanzanian singer Rich Mavoko does not want to be asked questions about his former WCB record label boss Diamond Platnumz. In a recent interview with Word Is, Rich said he has moved on from the drama of the record label. He told of his frustration with "those people". "Even if you ask me anything about those people, I would never comment," he said. Asked if he made the right decision to exit WCB, Rich said he keeps moving. "I can't talk about that boss. I can't talk anything kuhusu huyo mtu. I don't remember anything about him." Rich also said he does not follow up on other WCB signees who exited, and it's only bits of gossip that he hears. He insisted that only Diamond can answer.
