The Azimio manifesto is in the works and could be released in the course of next week, ODM leader Raila Odinga disclosed on Monday. He said the coalition has delayed the release of the blueprint for fear of copycats who may steal the ideas spelt in the document. Raila told his supporters in Kirinyaga that the document has details of how his administration will deliver in agriculture, industrialization, health, energy, water sectors and general economics. “Our think-tank is finishing the manifesto. It will be published next week. We didn’t want to release it early since we knew our rivals will want to copy us.” Speaking on the same day in Laikipia, the former Prime Minister said he will deal firmly with the high cost of living that has sparked protests against President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration. Raila, promising to deliver Kenyans to his proverbial ‘Canaan’, exuded confidence he would floor Deputy President William Ruto in the August 9 vote to enable him to deliver the promise. “We will defeat these people (Kenya Kwanza). Once we assume power, we will deal with corruption. A lot will change in the first 100 days of Baba’s government,” the ODM leader said. While addressing a rally in Laikipia on Monday, Raila also promised to reduce prices of basic commodities as well as fuel should he assume the presidency. “Our people are tired. Kenyans are burdened with high prices of basic commodities. Fuel prices are high so is maize flour. We will change all that,” he said. He was accompanied by several leaders among them area governor Ndiritu Muriithi, Senator aspirant Maina Njenga, and former National Assembly speaker Francis ole Kaparo among other dignitaries. “We are going to stage an economic revolution led by the youth. I want partners and not followers,” the former Prime Minister told his supporters.
