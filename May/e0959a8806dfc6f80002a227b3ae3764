Detectives are in possession of an 84mm mortar bomb that was discovered by a farmhand in Kigumo, Murang’a County, on Sunday. The discovery of the bomb brought Ngonda village to a standstill as villagers thronged around the object, some claiming that it was a missile while others thought it was overgrown arrowroot. The villagers unsuccessfully sought the help of a retired military officer who lives some 3 kilometres away to identify the object but his phone went unanswered. Luckily, the area chief got wind of the discovery and called detectives based at Ngonda police station in Kigumo who responded immediately. The detectives invited experts from the Forensic Bomb Disposal and Hazardous materials unit based at the DCI National Forensic Laboratory, who confirmed that the object was a bomb. "The weapon was most likely left behind by the British forces at the height of the Mau Mau uprising in 1953 when sections of Mt Kenya and Aberdare forests suffered aerial bombardment to flush out Mau Mau fighters," DCI said. The DCI Bomb experts will detonate the bomb tomorrow.
