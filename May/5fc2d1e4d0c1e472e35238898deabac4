Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i has asked the private sector to stop funding political aspirants who advocate for violence during campaigns. Speaking on Monday during a meeting with Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) Matiang'i said that intelligence brief show that most of the political crooks are funded by the private sector. He said that though the country was secure and relatively stable, actions by the businesses to fund aspirants who maintain organised gangs were undermining state efforts. "We have intelligence showing who is meeting who in the night in the estates in Nairobi and giving out the monies which then are used for bribery in the campaigns. You are in this room and we must tell each other the truth," Mating'i said. The CS said powerful politicians were blackmailing business players to fund them or they'll be blocked from operating after the August 9 elections. "No one should threaten you to fund them. Some of these crooks don't have that ability," he said. Matiang'i also reiterated his concern that the coming polls would launder criminals to public office. He said the polls will see "unprecedented level of voter bribery by 'wash wash' fellows." "Where do you get the money to give people Sh500 or even Sh1000 each in hotels and restaurants every morning if it's not from wash wash, money laundering and also funding from the private businesses?" He said. He also said the country's safety level was far better compared to the way it was at this point in the run up to the 2017 elections.
