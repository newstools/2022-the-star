The High Court in Eldoret has denied bail to Ibrahim Kipkemboi Rotich who is accused of murdering former international athlete Agnes Tirop. Justice Reuben Nyakundi ruled that it was not yet time to give bond to the accused person after assessing details of the case. Nyakundi cited the conduct of the suspect at the time the incident happened as the main reason it was not yet proper to allow bond for the suspect. "Maybe the application for bond can be reviewed at a later date, but for now the accused person will remain in custody," Nyakundi said. He directed that a pre-trial conference for the case be held on June 12, 2022. In his ruling, Nyakundi also said the court had considered safety of the accused person in the decision to deny him bail. The judge also said Rotich was a person of no known abode. The athlete's relatives, led by her father Vincent Tirop, expressed hope that justice will be served. Rotich has denied killing Tirop on October 12 last year at Rural estate in Iten town. Through his lawyer, Ngige Ngugi, Rotich had applied to be released on bond as the case continues. However, state counsel David Fedha filed an affidavit to oppose the application for bond. Last year Rotich was taken for medical tests and found fit to stand trial for the killing. Tirop was found dead in her house where she lived with Rotich as her boyfriend. A postmortem on the body revealed that she died after being stabbed in the neck and being hit by a blunt object in the head.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
