Deputy President William Ruto will on Tuesday be in Nyeri County for the funeral of his running mate Rigathi Gachagua's elder brother. James Reriani Gachagua died following a long battle with illness, the family said. Ruto will attend the funeral service that will be held at Hiriga Primary School in Mathira Constituency. This will also be the first visit the DP will be making with Gachagua as the designated Kenya Kwanza deputy presidential candidate. Ririeni died at the age of 78. “We thank God for the life of our eldest brother and the head of the greater Gachagua family, James Reriani Gachagua who has gone to be with the Lord after a long illness bravely borne,” MP Gachagua announced after Ririeni's death. He had vied for Mathira parliamentary seat in 2013 on a Ford Asili party ticket but lost to former MP Peter Weru. Reriani was also a brother to the first Nyeri governor the late Nderitu Gachagua who died while still in office on February 24, 2017, at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London while undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer. DP Ruto unveiled Gachagua as his running mate on Sunday, May 15. After the funeral, the DP will later hold a rally at Gatundu Stadium in Kiambu County.
