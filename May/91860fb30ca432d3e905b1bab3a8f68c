Fast-rising musician Ty Stringz has released ‘Shy' featuring popular Afrobeats artiste LAX. Ty Stringz said his new song single centres around empowering women to realise what beautiful creatures they are. "With percussion being paramount, the beat allows me to become loose and free," he said. "You could call it a sunny infusion of tropical fun mixing with lush instrumentals, melting away any insecurities." Speaking about working with LAX, he said they shared the same energy. "On hearing the song, he could automatically connect to it. It was pretty smooth for him to write his part to such beautiful music and with a great message." He is working on an EP that he said would be inspired greatly by his song 'Shy'.
