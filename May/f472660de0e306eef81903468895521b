Vihiga Queens coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has warned his charges to prepare for a bruising battle with Thika Queens who will be on a revenge mission after losing the Kenya Women's Premier League title. The reigning champions won the first leg 1-0, courtesy of Tereza Engesha's solo strike but Nyamunyamu is worried about the attacking threat posed by their opponents. "Thika are like a wounded lion. They have a point to prove so my players need to be on top of their game. The match will be mentally draining for both teams and we expect a balanced contest," Nyamunyamu said. "Our intention is to finish the season leg unbeaten and nothing has changed." Bunyore Starlets — winless in their last eight matches and fighting relegation — welcome Zetech Sparks at Mumboha grounds. Bunyore are 10th in the 12-team league with 15 points and must rediscover the imperious form they displayed earlier in the season to beat Sparks.
