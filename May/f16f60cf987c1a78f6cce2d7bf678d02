The Rio Olympics javelin silver medalist Julius Yego made a fruitful comeback to action when he threw a season best of 79.59m to finish second in the men's javelin at the Kip Keino Classic at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani. The 2015 African Games champion, Egyptian Abdelrahman Ihab, took top honours with an overall throw of 83.79m as South African Johan Grobler  came third with 79.11m. Another Kenyan, the 2013 African Junior champion Alexander Kiprotich, finished seventh with an overall throw of 75.04m in what was a disappointing afternoon for the military man. Yego was elated about the result and thanked the rapturous home crowd for their unwavering support. "They were with me with every step of the way and were always pushing me on. It was a very encouraging performance and now the next step is to rectify my weak areas even as I look to upcoming competitions," the 2015 World Champion said. The one-day meet is the final of a three-leg World Continental Tour Gold edition that began in 2020 at Nyayo Stadium and last year at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani.
