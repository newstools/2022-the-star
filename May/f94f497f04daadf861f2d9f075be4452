Online comedian Flaqo was not happy even after making millions of shillings from his content. In a recent interview with Plug TV, Flaqo opened up about his mental health. "During Covid-19, I made a lot of money. I was taking every advert that came to me," he said. "Adverts upon adverts. But I realised that it was leading me astray and I wasn't enjoying myself. It was like I had sold my soul." Asked how he dealt with online pressure, Flaqo said he took a break cause he was falling apart. "There were so many voices I wasn't used to hearing. Most of those voices were from social media, and they were tearing me down." The comedian added that despite ignoring the negative criticism from people online, it still bothered him. "People would say things about me and they didn't know anything about me," he said. "Although I said I didn't care, it affected me. It started eating and bothering me." The entertainer said he spoke to his dad and a few celebrities during this dark period in his life. "I thank God for my dad, who is a staunch man of God," he said. "And he gets on the phone and prays for me and I feel at peace. There is so much power in prayer. I also watch mental health specialists when I can." Flaqo said Bien helped him get a counsellor's contact. Flaqo said money derailed him during that period. "The more there is money, it takes away the artistic value and humour of my comedy. What matters to me is the art, before the money," he said.
