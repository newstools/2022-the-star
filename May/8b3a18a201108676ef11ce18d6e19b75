Waffles are perfect for breakfast, snacks, or dessert. Often served with sweet toppings like banana strawberries, syrup, or whipped cream. A waffle is a cake-like dish that is made from leavened dough that is cooked between two plates. The plates are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. You will need a waffle maker for this recipe. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Preheat your waffle maker to high heat. Then using a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Combine well. Step 2 Mix in the milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla. Stir until the mixture is very smooth to form a thick paste. Step 3 Once the waffle maker is very hot, add approximately ½ cup of the paste and cook for 3 ½ minutes undisturbed. Step 4 Open and remove the waffle when the exterior is golden-brown. Step 5 Once all the waffles are cooked, set aside and serve with your favorite syrup, toppings or even ice-cream.
