Shock and grief has engulfed Koguta village in Muhoroni after a 36-year-old village administrator allegedly beat his wife to death over alleged infidelity. Denis Okeyo is reported to have mercilessly beaten the wife on Friday night after suspecting that she was having an affair with another man. The deceased was aged 25 years old. Muhoroni OCPD David Muniu confirmed the incident saying he received the report about the alleged crime from Komuswa assistant chief Jack Mboha. "The man was suspicious that the wife had a love affair with another person and as a result of that he beat her brutally," Muniu said. The police boss said after the suspect realized that he had injured the wife and her life was in danger, he rushed her at a Catholic mission Hospital in Awasi. The hospital refereed him to the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital in Kisumu but the wife succumbed to her injuries on arrival. The OCPD said the suspect surrendered himself to the assistant chief who brought him to the Chemelil police post. "So, at the moment he is in custody as investigations continue," the OCPD said. Villagers who spoke to the media on Saturday were still in shock following the incident. They said nobody should take the law into their own hands. "Even if it's a matter of infidelity, he ought to have sent her back to her parents instead of killing her," Rosila Akoth, a close friend of the deceased said. "It's a sad day for us because we were with the deceased on Friday afternoon during our group meeting and did't know this would befall her," Margaret Juma added. David Okello, a local pastor, advised couples to look for spiritual leaders to help solve their marital differences. He condemned the incident and said it was very unfortunate for the accused to take matters into his own hands. The body of the deceased is lying at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital morgue.
