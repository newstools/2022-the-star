Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua on Tuesday afternoon welcomed Deputy President William Ruto to his Machakos office. The DP and Mutua are set to hold a rally in Tala, Machakos county for the first time after he announced that he had ditched the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya coalition for  Ruto's camp. The DP  had a brief tour of the office where he interacted with Machakos County Government staff and met with members of his cabinet. Mutua said they used the opportunity to plan on their next steps going forward. "I was pleased to host H.E @WilliamsRuto to my Machakos office - White House. We toured the office, he met members of my Cabinet and we held an opportunity to strategize," Mutua tweeted. Earlier during the day, Mutua chaired his Cabinet meeting where they discussed the economic outlook of Machakos. "We explored ways of speeding up development projects and services so that Wananchi can benefit. We agreed to supervise our staff to ensure lethargy does not set in. We may be in a political season but work has to continue," Mutua said. Ruto was accompanied by other Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders including Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetangula and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro. This comes even as the MCC party has been stopped by the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal from exiting the Azimio. On Tuesday, the Tribunal struck out the complaint by MCC on grounds that it was prematurely filed. It has also ruled that MCC should have first invoked the internal dispute resolution mechanisms before going to the tribunal. The MCC party moved to the Tribunal on Monday, stating that they were not aware of the contents of the coalition agreement with Azimio la Umoja.
