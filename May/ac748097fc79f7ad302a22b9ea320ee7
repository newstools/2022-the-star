Kajiado Central MP Elijah Memusi's wife Stella Memusi has died. Stella died in a road accident along the Athi River-Namanga road on Tuesday morning. The death was confirmed by Kajiado County Commander Muthuri Mwongera. Mwongera said the vehicle that she was travelling in rammed into a lorry killing her on the spot. The stretch along the Namanga Road is known for many tragic accidents and Stella’s car, a Nissan Patrol, had just taken the slope between Kenchic and Ummah University as they headed towards Kajiado town. Isinya police  in a statement, said at 23:10 hrs, on Monday, Stella’s vehicle hit at the rear right side angle of a stationary trailer in the middle of the road. It was after that huge bang that Stella’s body was found lifeless in the wreck, that was her car. According to the police, Stella was pronounced dead on arrival at the Kajiado referral hospital while her driver was admitted to the same facility. Jeremiah Lemomo who is the aide of MP Kanchory, said Stella and the driver had left Kajiado as they headed to Nakuru to return their children to school after the end of the term. “All was well when the two left with the children to school in the morning. After they left, I accompanied the MP to the IEBC offices in Kajiado for clearance,” said Lemomo. “This has devastated us all in the family. It came so abruptly. I have nothing to add to what I have told you. She was just a good mother, advisor, and mentor to us all in the family,”he said. Stella was remembered by the Kajiado Central constituents as a “woman who would attend to all their plights” at the time of need.
