Police in Homa Bay are looking for a suspect who escaped after killing a Form 3 student at a bar in Lwanda market, Ndhiwa constituency. The suspect had accompanied the deceased identified as Bonventure Ochieng Omondi to the bar for a drink when the duo disagreed and started fighting. Omondi, 17, was slashed with a panga and was pronounced dead on arrival at Homa Bay county Teaching and Referral Hospital. Residents who witnessed the Sunday evening incident said the two engaged in verbal exchanges before the suspect left. He returned with a panga. Omondi was a student at Lwanda Mixed Secondary School. A resident said they could not immediately establish what the two were fighting for because they have been drinking at the bar together for long. Kobita location chief Joash Osuju said a report made at Ndhiwa police station indicated the suspect identified as Abrahams Ooko left the bar and returned with a panga. “Many people at the joint thought they were engaging in a normal friendly argument. However, they were surprised when it turned chaotic and the suspect slashed his colleague,” Osuju said. Osuju said Ooko found Omondi seated at the table where they were drinking earlier and slashed him several times on both hands. The deceased was cut as he was trying to block panga. Ooko then dashed out of the bar and disappeared into the darkness. Residents tried to help Omondi by rushing him to a nearby health centre before being transferred to Homa Bay referral. Ndhiwa police boss Paul Rioba said they have been notified about the incident and are currently conducting a manhunt for the suspect. Omondi is said to have died due to excessive bleeding. The suspect dropped out of school some years ago. Residents with information on the whereabouts of the suspect have been urged to report to the police. “We’re collaborating with residents to trace the suspect who escaped after the incident,” Rioba said.
