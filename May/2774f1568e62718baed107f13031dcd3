Maringo Hamza MCA Mark Ndung’u has obtained orders compelling Jubilee to issue him with a certificate to run for the Makadara MP seat. This is after a Political Dispute Tribunal agreed with his demands to run for the seat. This throws off an earlier plan by Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance to zone Nairobi to get maximum seats. Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance settled on zoning within Nairobi to identify which areas political parties in the coalition will field candidates. This was said to be a master plan to ensure they lock out their rivals. The plan ended up rewarding already known Nairobi bigwigs, shutting down other hopefuls who were eager to fly the Azimio ticket. This angered some aspirants who had paid the nomination fee. The tribunal issued the orders on May 19. The party’s intentions to appeal were dismissed and ordered that his name be forwarded to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. ODM’s George Aladwa was given a direct ticket under the coalition to defend his seat. Aggrieved Jubilee aspirants had faulted Azimio’s decision not to hold primaries and instead issued direct tickets using opinion polls. They then gave the Raila Odinga led coalition an ultimatum to bring them to the table or face legal issues. Ndungu said, together with other aspirants, they had paid a nomination fee to the party and it was wrong for the coalition to fail to reimburse the same. “The party took our money and failed to issue us with the certificates under the zoning issue,” he said. He said the coalition had agreed and issued certificates to some candidates in some areas and wondered why they sidelined Makadara. “Could it be a plan to allow some other parties to win the seat?” Ndungu asked. He said he is still in Jubilee and it would have been better if the officials advised him to run and defend his seat instead of allowing him to go for the MP seat and be denied the ticket.
