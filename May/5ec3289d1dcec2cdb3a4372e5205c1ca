Kenyan match officials came under heavy fire once again after Posta Rangers head gaffer, Salim Ali, lambasted the centre referee for botching up their match against Sofapaka at Thika Stadium on Saturday. Ali was furious after his charges contentiously surrendered their lead in stoppage time to settle for a one-all draw. “We had a lot of hiccups in this game, the main one being questionable calls made by the referee throughout the game,” Ali said. “This kind of officiating only serves to kill football in the country. It's very discouraging to the players to work hard throughout the week in preparation for a match only for two or three people to mess it all up with poor officiating,” he observed. After a flurry of squandered opportunities by both sides, Bernard Ondiek fired the mailmen ahead in the 56th minute. With Ali's charges seemingly headed for a major celebration, Rody Manga grabbed an equalizer in stoppage time to ruin the party. As Ali rued a bad day in office, his opposite number David Ouma tore into his squad for failing to capitalize on glaring opportunities. “We need to be more organized on the pitch and make use of the chances we create,” Ouma said.
