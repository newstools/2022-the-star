Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula has congratulated Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua and PAA's Amason Kingi for joining Kenya Kwanza Alliance. Governors Mutua (Machakos) and Kingi (Kilifi) are yet to officially comment on the claims that they are joining the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. But Wetang'ula, through his tweet, welcomed the two party leaders to the alliance which supports Deputy President William Ruto’s presidential bid. The Bungoma Senator said the duo’s entry brings in additional energy to the coalition ahead of the August 9 General Election. "Congratulations Maendeleo Chap Chap and PAA political parties for joining the Kenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition. Your entry brings in additional energy and guarantees, even more, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s assured victory in the August 9 General elections. Hongera," he said. Mutua and Kingi have been protesting exclusion from the Azimio coalition. On Friday, Mutua claimed that the Registrar and the Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition refused to give them a copy of the Azimio coalition agreement. He said that the party will on Monday make a decision on the way forward bearing in mind the plans to zone Maendeleo Chap Chap party aspirants out, and the deadlines set by law. Mutua is set to address the nation today.
