Chile has asked FIFA to investigate whether Ecuador put an ineligible player in their World Cup qualifier. The team alleges that Byron Castillo is Colombian, and has misreported his age and nationality. The FFC claims he used a fake birth certificate to register as an Ecuadorian. If the allegations are true, the country would have to forfeit their spot in the upcoming World Cup. Chile wants Ecuador to forfeit the eight games Castillo played in, and are asking for opponents be awarded three points for each game. That would see Chile move from seventh to fourth in their qualifying group.
