Claims that Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission has arrested George Jalang’o are fake. The reports have been going viral on social media that EACC went to arrest the politician in his house in relation to the Sh90 million NHIF scandal. A post purported to have originated from Kenyance.co.ke quoted that Jalang’o had stated that his arrest was a political plan by a politician in Siaya. “ I want to put things straight, yes it is true that today morning I woke up meeting the EACC detectives right on my doorstep. They detained me for about four hours in their office in Kisumu following the Sh 90 million NHIF scandal that occurred while I was the manager of Quality Assurance at the body. I am very sure that these all are part of a political plan by the bigwig politician in Siaya," read the post. In response to the reports, EACC on May 25, 2022, distanced itself from the post stating it was fake news and that the commission had not arrested anyone. “Our attention has been drawn to a poster circulating online, in which it is alleged that EACC Detectives in Kisumu arrested and detained one George Jalang’o,” read the post. “Such events did not occur. The allegations constitute political propaganda which should be ignored," it added.
