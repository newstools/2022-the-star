After qualifying for the Commonwealth Games, world under 20 10,000m race walk champion Heristone Wanyonyi is now focused on going one step better by gracing the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, USA. The West Pokot walker, who made history by winning a rare gold medal at the WU20 Championships in Kasarani last year is currently preparing for his senior national team debut at the Africa Athletics Championships in Mauritius next month. The African event will act as a qualifier for the World Championships. “My aim at the Africa championships is to qualify for the World Championships," said Wanyonyi, who will be in the company of two-time Africa 20km race walk champion Samuel Gathimba and Simon Wachira. "I have had a good time in recent days and winning that slot will be a milestone in my career.” Wanyonyi finished fourth at the 2022 World Race Walking Team Challenge held in Oman, Jordan in April, a race in which he clocked 42:02. “The World Championships do not have a 10km walk race and the qualifying standards are a bit higher. It will be my goal to work hard and ensure that I make the (20km walk race team) team,” said Wanyonyi during a training session in Ngong on Thursday morning. The World Championships qualifying standard is set at 1 hour 21 minutes. “I want to travel to the USA. It is my dream to compete for Kenya and earn a medal in the senior ranks to add to the gold medal I won at the World Under 20 Championships,” he added. Wanyonyi said preparations are in top gear with his world U20 title defence in Cali Colombia also in his sights.
