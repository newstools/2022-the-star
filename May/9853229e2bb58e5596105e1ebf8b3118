Tom Mboya University College principal Prof Charles Ochola has been summoned for interrogation for allegedly assaulting a university academics staff union (UASU) official. The college is a constituent of Maseno University in Kisumu. Ochola is accused of assaulting Maseno University UASU branch secretary Dr Stephen Onyango on May 6 at Mamba hotel while having dinner with other union officials. Kisumu Central sub-county police commander Anthony Maina told the Star that Ochola was summoned for questioning over the alleged ongoing probe of an assault case. He said the matter was under investigation and nearing completion. Maina said the matter was reported on May 7 by the said assault victim. "We wanted to conduct thorough investigations over the said assault case. So as a person of interest, we summoned the professor," Maina said. Prior to being assaulted, Onyango had been subjected to the disciplinary committee chaired by university Vice-Chancellor Julius Nyabundi but UASU national officials faulted the disciplinary procedure and was aborted. Onyango, who is a lecturer at Maseno, said he was assaulted for raising concerns over the quality of grades of some students from the University. In a lecturer WhatsApp group of Maseno dons, he alleged that some students who fail in their exams ended up graduating. Onyango will face a disciplinary committee on Tuesday over his post on the WhatsApp group. The national UASU officials are aware of the assault case and have visited the university over the assault of a union official.
