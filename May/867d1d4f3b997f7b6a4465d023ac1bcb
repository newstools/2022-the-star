Two men repairing a pit latrine were killed when it collapsed on them at an estate in Ongata Rongai, Kajiado county. The two casual workers were fixing a cracked side of the latrine wall on Monday. Police and fire engine officials were called to the scene to retrieve the bodies from the waste. The bodies were moved to the mortuary for an autopsy. Officials from the county visited the scene and ordered the latrine be filled up and about 10 tenants be relocated until a new one is constructed. Meanwhile, police are investigating an incident in which a man was stabbed and seriously wounded by two other men believed to be members of a special group in a fight in a lodging in city centre. Police say two men first booked a room in the lodging before they were joined by a third one. The third man told the receptionist at the joint he was joining his friends for a meeting in room 33. A fight broke out. Two stabbed one man in the torso four times and escaped. The reason was not immediately established. An attendant at the hotel along River Road told police she heard a commotion from the room and went to check, only to find the men running out. One of them was bleeding. One of the men was later arrested as they tried to escape and told police they disagreed on their way to the place, prompting the fight and the stabbing. The injured man was taken to hospital, treated and discharged. The suspect is expected to face various charges of assault and causing bodily harm. Police said they were looking for the second suspect to understand the reasons for the fighting. (Edited by V. Graham)
