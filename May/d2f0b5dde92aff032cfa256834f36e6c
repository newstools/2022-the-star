A Thika-based pastor has been charged with obtaining Sh730,000 from a fellow pastor, pretending to be in a position to supply him with anointing oil. Martin Muraya of World Victory Church was accused of obtaining the money from his co-pastor, Samwel Mburu Kerige, by falsely pretending that he was in a position to supply Essential Oil and Seth molecules. The court heard that he committed the offence between November 9 and November 13, 2020, in Nairobi, with intent to defraud. According to the prosecution report, the two pastors previously worked together but went separate ways after one of them set up his own church. Since they were friends, Mburu approached him if he can help get the anointing oil for his church. Appearing before Milimani chief magistrate Wendy Micheni, Muraya denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He was released on a bond of Sh500,000. The case will be mentioned after two weeks. Meanwhile, in the same court, a South Sudanese national was also charged with obtaining by false pretence after staying at Serena Hotel and failing to pay a bill of Sh359,261. Amir Ahmed Mohammed allegedly incurred the bill after staying at the five-star hotel between April 12 and 28. He had promised to settle the bill by April 29, but failed to honour the promise. The charges said he incurred the liability with intent to defraud. He denied the charges and was released on a cash bail of Sh100,000.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
