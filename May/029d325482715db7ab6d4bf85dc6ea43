A man who allegedly threatened to lead a squad and kill his former employer has told the court he was just asking for his unpaid dues. Douglas Mbohani told Kibera senior principal magistrate Phillip Mutua on Friday that he only wanted his money and pleaded for leniency. “So will we have peace in this country, if everyone decides to ask for their unpaid dues like you?” Mutua posed. According to the charge sheet, the accused threatened to kill Edith Mukunya on May 18 at a hotel in Toi market in Kibra, Nairobi. The prosecution said Mbohani visited Mukunya’s hotel and created disturbance to customers, while threatening to kill his former boss. The court heard that during the commotion the accused altered the words of death threat contrary to the law. “Leo I will make sure nimekuangamiza. Nitarundi na squad yangu tukumalize (Today, I will make sure that I destroy you. I will come back with my squad and finish you),” the court heard. The prosecution said Mbohani is alleged to have trailed Mukunya to her house with a group of youths, he had reportedly hired. Mukunya locked herself in her house and later reported the matter to the police. The accused was arrested and charged in court with the offence. Mbohani denied the charges and pleaded for lenient bond terms. Mutua directed that Mbohani pays a cash bail of Sh50,000 with a surety of the same amount. The court directed that the matter be mentioned on June 6. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
