The final two relegation slots will be decided on the last day of the 20212022 Kenya Women's Premier League 2021-22 season, which is set to end on June 12. Kangemi Ladies were relegated last weekend after their 5-0 loss to already crowned champions Vihiga Queens. With three matches left, pressure is mounting at the bottom end of the standings with two teams expected to join Kangemi for life in Division One next season. Wadadia are on 18 points, Kayole and Bunyore both have 16 while Kisumu All-Starlets have amassed 14 so far. Bunyore face a season-defining moment with fixtures against Zetech Sparks, Kangemi, and rivals Vihiga set to determine their fate in the top tier. Kisumu's destiny lies in Trans-Nzoia Falcons, Thika Queens, and Kayole Starlets' encounters while Wadadia will savour their chances against Kangemi, Vihiga, and Thika. Kayole face an uphill task with Ulinzi, Falcons, and Kisumu fixtures lying in wait. Kisumu team manager Berryl Oketch said in as much as they are prepared for the run-in, they might depend on other teams slipping to guarantee safety. "Where it has reached, we can only rely on miracles. We are taking one game at a time but it doesn't get any easier. The team will fight till the last fixture but also we are prepared for any eventuality." As for Bunyore, coach Zachariah Amakhanga said their priority is to retain the top-flight status. He thinks four points will be enough for the team and he is banking on home matches against Sparks and Vihiga to seal their feat. " We shall survive by all means even though this battle will be decided on the last day. It's our own fault to have found ourselves in the current position. The team is under immense pressure to deliver and I believe we shall survive the storm."
