The 2015 All Africa Games 10,000m silver medalist Gladys Chesir says she has put behind her the disastrous fall at the Eldoret City Marathon and is now determined to make amends at this Sunday’s Copenhagen Half Marathon. Chesir fell midway through the April 10 race in Eldoret, forcing her to spend some time on the sidelines. However, she says she has recovered and is ready for Sunday's race in the Danish capital. “I had a bad fall, failing to complete the race but I am fine right now. I am ready for the competition. It has been a while since I ran in such a big race but am ready to challenge my competitors,”  Chesir said. The 2017 Lille Half Marathon champion added that she has been working round the clock to recover in time for the road race and is confident all the hard work will be rewarded on Sunday. “I have had some good preparations and I believe that I will get to the finish line with a good time. I want to run a personal best time,” the 2010 Youth Olympics 3,000m champion said. This will be her fourth marathon after the Amsterdam, Boston and Enschede. Other Kenyans in the women's race include the 2015 world marathon bronze medalist Helah Kiprop, Lina Cheruto, Pascalia Jepkogei and Agnes Keino. The Ethiopian contingent includes Muluhabt Tsega, Yanenesh Dejene, Meselech Alemayehu, Melkam Wale and Zinah Senbeta. In the men's race, Kenya will be led by Daniel Kipchumba, Kiprotich Kirui, Edwin Maiyo, Luke Kibet, Benjamin Malot and Pasul Eyanei.
