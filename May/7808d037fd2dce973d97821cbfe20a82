Murang'a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria was on Tuesday stuck in a lift for minutes at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) headquarters based at Anniversary Towers. Wa Iria was accompanied by his supporters in a relentless search for IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati. However, when he boarded a lift to one of the floors, the elevator malfunctioned sparking a standoff and panic among his supporters and IEBC security officials. One of the security guards said that the emergency team had already been called to help with the situation. Some of the supporters who had accompanied the presidential aspirant said they read mischief in the development. "They have declared war on us and we are going to deal with them," one of the supporters said. After some minutes, Iria came out of the elevator visibly sweating and holding his tie. "My friend! Have you ever been stuck in a lift like that?" he asked journalists who sought to know how he was feeling. His security claimed the guards had switched off the air conditioner of the elevator the governor had boarded. He addressed the media saying all aspirants should be on the lookout adding he has sensed malice in the ongoing clearance of candidates. "I'm telling all contestants to raise their voices now because it might be too late when they do," he said. Wa Iria has recently been frequenting the IEBC offices since Monday after his name was removed from the list of presidential aspirants to be cleared by the electoral body to vie for the top seat. He on Monday blocked the entrance to the Bomas of Kenya while trying to seek an audience with Chebukati in vain.
