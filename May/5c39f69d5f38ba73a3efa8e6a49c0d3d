Former Tana River Governor Hussein Dado and former Garsen MP Danson Mungatana want to make a political comeback after years in the cold. Dado was trounced by Godhana Dhadho in 2017 after serving for one term as the county chief, while Mungatana lost the Garsen MP seat in 2013. Dado and Mungatana are vying for Tana River governor and senator respectively on UDA. The duo joined other aspirants to rally for Deputy President William Ruto's presidential bid at Atata Primary School grounds in Mororo on Tuesday. Dado urged residents to support and vote for Ruto come August 9 saying he is best suited to take care of the county interests. “The UDA government is going to implement the bottom-up development model. The sign of the wheelbarrow means we can empower those who are pushing themselves to put food on their tables. “We do not want to keep talking about the past as our competitors. We are looking at the future and the person to take us there is Ruto,” he said. The former governor congratulated Ruto for choosing Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate, describing him as a good leader. Dado said he had worked with Gachagua in provincial administration and he was a team player with a proven track record in civil service. Mungatana said residents should vote for all UDA candidates seeking elective seats in the general election. He said it will be easier for the leaders to work in the same government than to work in opposition. “Your senator can not serve you well, when he is not on good terms with the president. This is why I urge you to vote for our party leaders, so that we all form and be in government,” Mungatana said. Other leaders present were Woman Representative and Bura MP aspirant Rehema Hassan and Sala MCA Fauzia Karani. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
