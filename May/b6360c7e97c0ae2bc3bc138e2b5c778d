Butali Warriors were held to a barren draw by hard-fighting Western Jaguars in the Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League match played in Kakamega on Saturday. The defending champions were toothless in attack despite fielding their best forwards in Shamah Ademba, Festus Onyango and George Mutira. The draw was Butali's second of the season after dropping points against eternal rivals Kenya Police in the 2-2 dramatic draw. Abraham Korir's 37th-minute strike was all that Parkroad Badgers needed to overpower Sailors at the City Park Stadium. Badgers won by the same margin against Mombasa Sports Club two weeks ago as the David Omwaka tutored side try to build momentum in the 10 - team league. In another match, Greensharks piled more misery on MSC, edging the coastal side 2-1 in Mombasa. Benson Ochieng and Chris Wokila were on target for Greensharks rendering Mariano Emadau's strike a consolation. MSC are winless in five matches with zero points thus far and the newbies could be back to the second tier after one season at the top if they fail to improve. Captain Mourine Owiti scored the only goal as Lakers defeated Wolverines in the women's match. In the men's Super League, Sikh Union made light work of Mvita, demolishing the Coastal side 3-0. Harvir Sigh bagged a double as Nelson Shiahale scored the other. Editing by Tony Mballa
