Supporters of Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua are up in arms with any plan that will see the first-term MP not picked as Deputy President William Ruto's running mate in the August polls. A section of Gachagua's supporters pitched a tent at a hotel in Karatina town, in Nyeri County following the developments on TV. The supporters were heard chanting "No Rigathi, No Ruto" after reports alleged that the MP had not been chosen as Ruto's running mate. Gachagua's supporters warned they will quit the Kenya Kwanza Alliance in the event their preferred choice is not picked as DP's running mates. Kariithi Wambui, a Nyeri UDA youth leader, led the group of supporters in insisting that Gachagua is the best person for the running mate seat. "We want to tell MPs from Mt Kenya that they will not be the ones to select a running mate," Wamumbi said. Konyu MCA Eric Wamumbi also weighed in on the allegation saying the only arrangement they are aware of is that which will unveil Gachagua as the running mate. "The DP has been telling us hapangwingwi when he visits Mt Kenya. Today, he was to announce Gachagua as his running mate. What has happened now? Has he changed?" Wambui posed. Others present during the meeting included Nyeri senatorial candidate Wahome Wamatinga, MPs aspirants Njoroge Wainaina (Kieni), Geoffrey Wandeto (Tetu), Duncan Maina Mathenge(Nyeri town), Wambugu Wainaina (Othaya).
