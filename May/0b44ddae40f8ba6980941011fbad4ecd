Kangemi Ladies forward Fasila Adhiambo was crowned the Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) Player of the Month for February/March 2022, in the Kenya Women Premier League. Adhiambo scored six goals in four matches to help Kangemi record their only win of the season against Wadadia. "I'm really proud and happy. I didn't expect to win the award but I thank God," said Adhiambo, noting that her focus is now on finishing as the league's top scorer. "The league is almost coming to the end and I look forward to finishing the season on a high, hoping to score more goals to finish as the top scorer," she noted. The Under-20 national team goal poacher bagged 37 votes to beat Ulinzi Starlets midfielder Diana Shakava (26) and Kayole Starlets' Christine Kadima (20). On his part, head coach Joseph Orao noted that the award is a motivation to the team, adding he is confident Adhiambo will finish as the top scorer. "We are happy our player has received the award. It's a big motivation to the young girls and we are proud of Fasila. She has been outstanding this season despite missing some games due to injury, she is still among the top scorers," said Orao. The 17-year-old becomes the third player to win the award this season in the WPL, after Zetech Sparks’ Joy “King Lady” Ayiro and Vihiga Queens' Phoebe Oketch. She walked home with a personalized trophy and a cheque worth Sh10,000. Editing by Tony Mballa
