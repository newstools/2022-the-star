Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) have warned all teams who owe them money to pay up or risk being locked out of this year's activities. KBF treasurer, Peter Orero, issued the warning during the AGM held at Nyayo National Stadium over the weekend. The federation is owed over Sh1.3m in league fees arrears. "They need to give us their payment plan on how they will clear the debts. This is what we are interested in before the league throws off," said Orero. He added: "You can see what we are owed out there. It is not small money. They must clear it or risk being locked out." He said despite the fee hitch, they still managed to pay all our referees. "It was a big problem for us but we did it," Orero noted. KBF chairman, Paul Otula, lauded the government and National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOC-K) for their continued help. "They gave us all the necessary support we needed and we appreciate it," said Otula adding, that KBF will enter teams in the junior and 3×3 events. On the national team, he said local-based players have started training for the Africa World Cup Qualifiers window Two in Egypt. He constituted a four-man committee to help streamline the issues on player transfers. The team consists of Ronnie Owino, Denis Menya, Steve Kuta as well as KBF secretary Ambrose Kisoi. The Kenya Women Commission (KBWC) chairperson Nelly Odera was co-opted as a member of the federation.
