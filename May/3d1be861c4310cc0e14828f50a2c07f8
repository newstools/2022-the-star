Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said that the ongoing spats between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto is unnecessary. Speaking in Machakos County during the burial ceremony of former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama’s daughter on Monday, Kivutha called for calm between the two top leaders in the country. “A time is coming in our country when we will need peace to be made…hata hakuna maana ya kurushiana maneno na president, hiyo waati umepitwa,” Kibwana said. He said that by exchanging words to his boss, the same might haunt him when he also becomes the leader. The governor said that the August 9 election is very close, and that it will be impossible for the next president to rule without the help of the other. “It is better as Kenyans to prepare ourselves for that.” Kibwana reckoned that the Kenya Kwanza Alliance manifesto of the Bottom-Up approach in economy is good only if it is dully implemented. “If you start from the bottom, from the majority who are hustlers, you can help a country and the continent very much. That concept is necessarily not a bad concept, no. Even in Azimio, we have similar concept. If it is planned well, it will help our country,” Kibwana said. His comments comes as Uhuru and Ruto rivalry takes centre stage ahead of election, as Azimio and Kenya Kwanza lock horns. Uhuru, who is the chairperson of a top decision-making organ of the Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition party has been blaming his deputy for criticising the government which he is part of instead of helping him to deliver government’s promises to Kenyans. On Sunday, during the Labour Day celebrations, Uhuru asked Ruto to exit the government instead of acting as opposition leader.
