Kenyans are waiting with bated breath as Kenya Kwanza Alliance is set to name Deputy President William Ruto's running mate on Saturday. Sources had earlier intimated that the time set was 10 am but later it was pushed to 1 pm and then to between 2 pm and 3 pm. According to media reports, the Kenya Kwanza Alliance is behind schedule as the leaders are still held up in a meeting at DP's residence in Karen. By midday, some DP Ruto's allies were still making their way to DP's residence, among them being former Kiambu governor William Kabogo. The DP is expected to make the announcement at his official Karen residence and the announcement will end months of speculation that has surrounded Ruto’s choice of a running mate. Speculations have it that the names of the possible running mates have narrowed down to two candidates, Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki and Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua. Three other individuals have been highly mentioned to be gunning to be Ruto’s number two. They include; ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru and National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi. Ruto on Friday spent the better part of the morning meeting leaders, including UDA politicians from the Mt Kenya region, at his Karen residence. Those aware of the plans to unveil the coalition deputy said Ruto was ready to live up to his promise to forward the name of his running mate to the electoral commission before Monday. The DP will thereafter lead his troops to Narok county to attend the burial of nominated David Sankok's son Memusi. (Edited by Mercy Asamba)
