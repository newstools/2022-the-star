Content creator Sharon Mundia is taking a long break from blogging. Announcing on her Instagram stories, Sharon said she has put a lot of thought into it. "I've been thinking what it is I'm doing and this isn't the first time I've had such thoughts in the last five months," she said. "I just don't really feel like I am and if it has any kind of impact, if just those kind of existential type of questions, what I'm doing with my life, and I think for a while what I had decided to focus on, and so I asked what are the numbers, how much are we making?" She expressed unhappiness with the direction her career is taking, adding that she has been grateful for the journey. She said this is not her first long break as she had taken a year off but come back. "I'm really not happy and I've struggled with sleep. I've struggled with where things are," she said. "I've struggled with so many fronts and I want to do right by myself." She said the break will help her restrategise. "Not to say it's bye, I'm out; it's just to think more intentionally and strategically and holistically about what it is I do and why I'm doing it," she said. "I don't want to blog just for money. I will step back. I'm not sure when exactly but for a good chunk of time." The beauty, life and style content creator assured Kenyans that she had lost track of why she has been creating content. "Not to say it's a complete 180-degree change so that it's not just finances and money getting me out of bed."
