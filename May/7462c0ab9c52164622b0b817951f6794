Embu politicians have praised the clergy in the county for uniting people and promoting peace during campaigns. Governor aspirants Lenny Kivuti, Cecily Mbarire and senator hopeful Lilian Mbogo said the church leaders are advocating love and peace. They spoke on Wednesday during interdenominational prayers at ACK St Peter's Cathedral in Siakago, Mbeere North. Mbarire urged politicians to maintain peace and respect the special role played by the church. She said politicians should avoid inciting Kenyans by belittling and insulting their competitors. "Let me appreciate the special role being played by the clergy from various denominations in this county, especially for organising prayers and calling for issue-driven campaigns," Mbarire said. Kivuti said leaders should adopt agenda-based campaigns and tell residents about the plans they have for the county. "To my fellow politicians, share your agenda and avoid mentioning other politicians in a bad light," he said. Kivuti said people should embrace love and ignore politicians who speak ill of others instead of selling their development agenda. Mbogo praised the clergy for uniting and preaching peace among Embu residents and politicians. "Embu clergy is serving as a good example for the country. I give thanks to the church for uniting politicians in praying for peace and maintaining peaceful campaigns," she said.
