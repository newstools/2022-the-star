Police in Kisumu have launch a manhunt for five suspected thugs who attempted to rob an iron sheet hardware at Nyamasaria area on Saturday. The suspects were armed with two pistols. One was home made. They stormed Daima Mabati shop mid morning pretending to be customers. Attendants at the shop said two suspects walked in first and were taken through the different prices of iron sheets. Immediately, three others walked in and also inquired about iron sheets. Elizabeth Mito said they did not know that the two groups of people were together. She said they drew guns and ordered them to lie down. Two others went to the store where they took money in a box. "We all lay down as they took our phones and IDs during the process," Mito said. Vincent Onyango said he ran to Nyamasaria patrol base and reported the matter prompting the police to respond. "We came back with the officers and found as the thugs were leaving." A chase ensued and police managed to deflate the tyres of the get-away car by firing live bullets. The thugs abandoned the car and escaped on foot leaving behind the loot. Some of the suspects escaped with gunshot wounds. The Probox vehicle and the safe the thugs attempted to escape with are at Nyamasaria police post pending investigations.
