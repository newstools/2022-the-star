Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) director Ezekiel Mutua now says the Azimio coalition was licenced to use any song including that of Kenyan boy band Sauti Sol in his campaigns. Mutua in a statement faulted Kenya Copyrights Board for arguing that the Azimio coalition erred in using Sauti Sol's Extravaganza song KECOBO Executive Director Edward Sigei said the coalition had no right to use the band's soundtrack with a visual image. "The coalition only obtained a Public Performance License that allows them to only play local and international music at its rallies and events," Sigei said. “The use of sound recording with a soundtrack with visual images in a film, video, television show, commercial, or other audio-visual production is not part of the license,” Sigei said. Mutua however said the Board is not Sauti Sol's Marketers and should stop causing confusion adding it will lead to spiting the MCSK's clients and the Collective Management Organization (CMO). "Our over 15,000 members, including Sauti Sol, have assigned to us, not only the performing rights but also mechanical synchronization," Mutua clarified. He also said the Music Society has been licensing the synchronization for decades, a fact well known to KECOBO. Mutua said that the Boards ought to praise Azimio for complying with the Copyright Law by getting a license for the songs used in their political rallies. The MSCK boss also attached a copy of the licence document to his post indicating the political coalition had paid Sh562,500 to access and publicly use the music. The licence is valid until May 6, 2023. The boy band had on Monday threatened to sue the Azimio team after using a soundtrack of their song Extravangaza during Martha Karua's naming as the coalition's deputy flagbearer. "Through their action, they have taken away the right to own and control what is originally and solely our property and have directly associated us with their campaign without our consent," the group said.
