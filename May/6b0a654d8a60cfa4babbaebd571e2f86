Embu clergy have urged aspirants to maintain peace before, during, and after the August polls. Led by the National Council of Churches of Kenya Embu chairman Bishop Njeru Nyaga, the clergy said the leaders are responsible for the nation's peace. Nyaga spoke on Wednesday during prayers held by all Embu churches at ACK St Peters Cathedral in Siakago, Mbeere North. The event was attended by governor aspirants Lenny Kivuti of the DEP party, UDA's Cecily Mbarire and Emilio Kathuri of Jubilee. Others were Senators, Woman Reps, MPs and MCA aspirants. “Peace is our main appeal. We pray that it is maintained during these politically heated moments,” Nyaga said. He said it's everyone's responsibility to have a better Kenya after the elections. The chairman said electorates should elect members based on their intellectual ability and vision for Embu but not by handouts. Nyaga said Embu residents should avoid leaders doing tribal and ethnic politics. Embu Catholic Diocese Bishop Paul Kariuki said the church will not lean on any side of leaders but will support them through prayers. He, however, called on leaders to concentrate on development politics that will empower education, health and other sectors. “We are talking of the late President Kibaki's legacy due to the development record he initiated, we don't remember him due to his ethnicity,” Kariuki said. Governor aspirant Lenny Kivuti said leaders should engage in peaceful campaigns. He said leaders should concentrate on passing their development agenda and avoid belittling others because that will not add any value. The Development Empowerment Party chairman said he will distance himself from politics of ill talking and that politicians should promote peace while campaigning.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
