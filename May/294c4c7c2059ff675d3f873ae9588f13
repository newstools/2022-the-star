Finlays Community Trust on Friday has given Sh4 million worth of secondary school scholarship to 20 students. The trust is owned by James Finlays (K) Ltd. The company sponsors bright pupils and students from Kericho and Bomet counties. Each of the 20 students received a four-year scholarship. The students are children of staff working with James Finlays in Kericho and Bomet counties. Trusts secretary Sammy Kirui said James Finlay (K) Ltd is concerned about the education of the children of its employees and neighbouring communities in both Kericho and Bomet counties. He said the help offered by the company through the trust is an appreciation to the employees and neighbouring communities. Kirui and trust vice chairman Joshua Terer assured the parents of the 20 students that the company will continue to support learners who will do well in the KCSE exam. Kirui said the company is sponsoring a few students in the university. Terer said, “Go to secondary schools that you were admitted to with fixed minds of excelling as you did at primary school level.” He told the students not to be scared by the new environment if they expect to do well in the KCSE exam. Kericho county director of education Rose Sagara told students who got the scholarship to aim high and continue with education up to PhD level. James Finlays Gitumbe group manager Raymond Cheruiyot urged the 20 students to focus on education. “Go to school with a fixed mind of learning,” he said.
