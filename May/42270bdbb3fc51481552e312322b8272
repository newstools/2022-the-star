Kigali International Peace Half Marathon bronze medalist Edna Jerono Kimitei is praying for a podium finish at the inaugural Nairobi City Marathon on Sunday. Kimitei, who has dominated the half marathons across the world, will be debuting in the full road race but is still hopeful her preparations will bear fruit. “This will be my first time running a marathon but I am well prepared to run well and finish on the podium. With that, I will celebrate,” Kimitei said. She added: “I wanted to run 21km but I had to change my mind to run in a marathon, which is the best place to launch my full marathon career. Running at home is very challenging and placing in the top 10 is always a good achievement." Sharpening her running skills in Iten, the former Millennium Half Marathon runner is, however, cognisant of the tough competition ahead considering the lucrative prize money on offer. “The race has good money and many athletes will be running. This means it will be so competitive, unlike other Kenyan races. Top athletes are expected to run for a better kill. With this contingent, I need to up my game and add more efforts to attain my target of reaching the podium,” she said. Last year, she finished third at the Kigali International Peace Half Marathon, timing 79:49 behind Ethiopian Marthe Yankurije (75:07) and Adeline Musabyeyezi (76:28) in first and second respectively. Dubbed Uhuru Classic, the race will start at the Nyayo National Stadium, where 33km will be run on the newly-built Nairobi Expressway, then the Central Business District. Winners will pocket Ksh6.9 million in the full marathon for both men and women, second-placed finishers will earn 4.02 million while third-placed finishers are entitled to 2.875 million, running down to 20th finisher.
