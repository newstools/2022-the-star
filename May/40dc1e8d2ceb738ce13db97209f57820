At least eight passengers and a matatu driver have been hospitalised after suspected armed bandits attacked their vehicle with bullets at Kainuk, in Turkana South. A Nissan matatu belonging to Quick Shuttle service plying Lodwar, Kapenguria and Kitale route was sprayed with bullets by suspected bandits on Sunday. The public service vehicle, which is a 14-seater matatu, was heading to Lodwar from Kitale when the suspected bandits attacked it. Turkana South Sub-County Police Commander Robert Kibuchi confirmed the incident saying that the vehicle was attacked along with Kenya Wildlife Service camp near Kainuk Trading Centre in the border of Turkana and West Pokot counties. “A quick shuttle vehicle was stopped by eight suspected Pokot bandits just after KWS camp. They emerged from the bush and signalled the matatu to stop. They, thereafter, shot the driver in the chest. The gunmen then embarked on haphazardly shooting at the matatu and its occupants,” said Kibuchi. Kibuchi said the assailants were eight in number and they were all armed with rifles. He said the suspected bandits opened the matatu’s door and robbed the victims of their belongings, including cash and mobile phones at gunpoint. The police boss said three people critically injured have been referred to Moi Teaching and Referral hospital. He said Security personnel from Astu camp, Kainuk police officers are in pursuit of the suspected bandits.
