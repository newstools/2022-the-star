Police are investigating an incident in which a man set himself ablaze after being misguided by his nurse friend in Garissa’s Iftin. Mohamud Haret, a resident of Kora Kora area of Iftin had escorted a patient to Mukono hospital where his friend works as a nurse. During the visit, Haret innocently consulted the medic if the methylated spirit he saw at the desk could cause burns. In jest, the nurse misadvised his friend to douse himself with the liquid and strike a matchstick. This, he suggested, would answer his friend's question perfectly. Police said Haret trusted the nurse and applied the tingling liquid on his skin. “He then lit himself up only to realise the mess he was in when the lit fire engulfed him could hardly be contained,” the police said. The inquisitive hospital guest turned into a patient who sustained serious burns on the chest, face and arms. Police said he was transfered to Ghal Private Hospital for further treatment. Causing others to inflict harm and injuries to themselves is a criminal offence. “Reckless acts can equally earn someone a prison term. We urge the public to desist from dangerous acts that may inflict harm to themselves, and those around them,” police added.
