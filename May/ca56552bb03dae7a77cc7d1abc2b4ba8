Award-winning actress Catherine Kamau, alias Kate Actress, did a cosmetic gastric balloon procedure to lose weight. The cost of the whole process in Kenya ranges from Sh300,000 to Sh500,000. Speaking to her fans on Instagram, Kate said the main reason she needs to lose weight and tone her body is in order to take up a certain role in acting. "Guys, because you feel someone else's body is perfect, I don't feel that way. I feel like the elephant I saw in 'The Ark' (movie)," she said. The former 'Mother-in-Law' actress said for the past six months, she has been in and out of the gym. "I have tried and there was no change. It is not that I don't like my body. I don't feel healthy," she said. "There are roles I would like to play, that I feel I'm ready for, but I feel I would be more confident and sexy if I was a few kilogrammes lighter." According to medical websites, intragastric balloon placement is a weight-loss procedure that involves placing a saline-filled silicone balloon in your stomach. This helps you lose weight by limiting how much you can eat and making you feel fuller faster. This balloon is placed in your stomach during a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure. The process of getting a balloon isn't quite a surgery, but it has the effect of shrinking your stomach temporarily so you eat less and lose weight.
