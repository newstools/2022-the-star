Ford Kenya and ANC parties will control 30 per cent of state if Deputy President William Ruto wins the August 9 elections, Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula has said. Wetang’ula said the Kenya Kwanza government will also tarmac 10,000 kilometres of roads in western region and build a coffee factory in Mt Elgon. ­“I want to promise the people of Mt Elgon that in the first two years after we take leadership, we will put up a coffee factory to serve farmers in this region,” Wetangula said. “We will also revive the ailing Nzoia Sugar factory by supplying them with new milling machines.” Wetang’ula was speaking on Monday, while addressing Ford Kenya delegates at the party headquarters in Bungoma town. Wetang’ula defended their decision to team up with Ruto saying they believes that it is the only coalition that can win presidential elections. He asked Bungoma residents to rally behind Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka ,who is seeking to reclaim the governor’s seat. Lusaka was elected Bungoma’s first governor in 2013 but lost to Wycliffe Wangamati in 2017. “Lusaka is with no doubt capable to deliver Bungoma and bring development projects that will benefit the people just as he did during his first term in office,” Wetang’ula said. Lusaka told his competitor to brace for the mother of all battles saying they had sensed defeat and have now opted to use propaganda and insults. “They are feeling the heat and they have panicked as seen from how they are going round spreading propaganda and lies to residents,” he said. He promised to better the current scholarship programme by ensuring equity and fairness in the vetting process. He opposed the current system of awarding scholarship saying only those who are politically correct  with the administration benefit. Lusaka also said all the World Bank projects in the county are his brainchild and where signed and initiated during his tenure but the current government is just implementing them.
