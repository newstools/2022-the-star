The Marsabit multi-agency security team on Wednesday held a joint disarmament sensitization meeting with Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs from Loiyangalani and Laisamis areas in Marsabit town. The team was led by the area County Commissioner Paul Rotich. "The County boss and his delegation were impressed by the intensified patrols and successful recoveries of illegal arms and ammunition," NPS said. They praised the security teams and local administrators for progressively restoring normalcy after the past insecurity incidences that informed the commencement of the multi-agency security operations. Rotich said peacemaking is a journey that requires joint efforts and urged the Chiefs and their assistants to support the disarmament exercise by holding public barazas intended to encourage residents to voluntarily surrender illegal weapons to authorities. "The members of the public should also help us, it is a journey we need to walk together and we have had very isolated cases which is an indication that we are progressing towards peace," Rotich said. Operations Commander Benard Mbatha emphasized the need to embrace peace initiatives in solving conflicts and encouraged timely sharing of security information. He further instructed security teams to firmly address the rising concerns on contraband goods and drug trafficking by arresting and prosecuting culprits involved in such criminalities. Mbatha was the GSU commander steering a security operation in Laikipia last year and was redeployed to Marsabit three days ago. The security team has so far recovered  14 assault rifles, a general-purpose machine gun, 617 rounds of assorted ammunition and other crude weapons illegally held by residents. The recoveries were made in various sub-counties in Marsabit County between May 10 and 13.
