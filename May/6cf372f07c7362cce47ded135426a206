Sofapaka head coach David Ouma reckons his charges have rediscovered their lost magic wand and the least they can now settle for this season is a top-five finish in the Kenyan Premier League. The 2009 KPL champions have experienced rising fortunes since Ouma took the reins from Ken Odhiambo who left in March. “It is a good feeling to be on a winning streak. It gives us more confidence in future games and makes our targets more realistic,” Ouma told the club's website. “We had set a target to have a solid finish, and a top five finish has been the priority. I am glad we are on the right track and I hope we can carry on with the positive results to finish the season strongly.” Ouma said their hard-fought 2-1 win over Bidco United at Kasarani Annex over the weekend attested to their rising curve. “We faced a good side and we knew which areas to exploit to give us the advantage in the game. I am proud that the players played up to instructions and, most importantly, we took advantage of our chances and that was the difference in the match.” Ouma was full of rosy words for his talismanic forward Rody Manga who has been finding the back of the net at whim. “Roddy has been working hard and diligently in training. He is a foreigner and I bet this to an extent took a toll on him in settling, but I am happy for him because he finally got his footing right,” Ouma said. “He is a typical finisher, and this has been evident in the past two games, scoring three and assisting one. He was literally the difference on Saturday, and his goals were superb. I hope he can carry on in the remaining matches.” Editing by Tony Mballa
