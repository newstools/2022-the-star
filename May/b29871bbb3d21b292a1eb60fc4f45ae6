A Nairobi court has given the DPP a last adjournment in a hate speech case against former Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel. This is after Lempurkel through his lawyer told court that he had not been supplied with documents by the prosecution. The case was set for hearing on Monday after the ex-legislator was charged afresh with hate speech. “This is not the first time the prosecution has withheld documents to the defence and let this be the last time there is an adjournment on an account of documents,” the court was told. Lempurkel appeared before Milimani senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi. “I am marking it as the last adjournment. If the documents are not supplied in the next hearing date then it shall be considered as evidence and the hearing shall proceed,” the magistrate said. He adjourned the case to June 14. Ten witnesses are set to testify in the case. Lempurkel is accused of making hateful remarks by uttering abusive and threatening words towards members of the Kikuyu community on a show aired by Maa TV on July 17, 2021. He is alleged to have said, “Those people known as buffaloes, marginalised us,” words that are alleged to have fueled ethnic hatred in Laikipia. In another count, the former MP is accused that on the same date while on the TV show, he uttered words that may have led to racial profiling and threats against members of the white community. Lempurkel is out on a cash bail of Sh150,000.  (Edited by Tabnacha O)
