Despite squandering an eight-point gap they enjoyed a few weeks ago, former international and veteran coach Alfred Imonje still believes Kakamega Homeboyz have what it takes to seal the Premier League. Imonje singled out the depth of the team as their biggest strength over their opponents in the race for the title hots up. "The management of the club has done excellent work in assembling a well-blended playing unit that enjoys massive quality. "All along, Kakamega Homeboyz have exhibited great soccer and proved themselves as one of the top contenders in the league. All they need is to maintain the fighting spirit and embrace teamwork in the remaining matches," said Imonje. He added: "During this stage when the league is at the home stretch, it normally gets tough because each team is fighting for points." He said coach Benard Mwalala has the experience to steer the team to the glory. " However, to realize his dream, he will have to consider rotating his players in the remaining matches to enhance freshness in the team," he added. Imonje lauded the team for the spirited fight and competitiveness that has them become a force to reckon with. Former Kenyan international also attributed Homeboyz's good run to proper pre-season preparations as well as good recruitment policies. Kakamega Homeboyz top the league with 56 points from 29 matches with a point separating them from second-placed Tusker.
