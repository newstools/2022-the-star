Sirisia MP aspirant Moses Nandalwe has pledged to build NG-CDF offices in every ward to improve accessibility of services to residents. Nandalwe was speaking at his Sibanga home on Sunday, saying the three wards of Namwela, South Kulisiru and Lwandanyi have been lacking crucial services for long. He said if given the chance to serve he will bring back sanity and openness in the vetting and awarding of bursaries to needy students. “The current leadership has done nothing for the education sector, I want to ask Sirisia people to rally behind my bid and remove this leadership from office,” Nandalwe said. “The current CDF office will be left for the OCPD and OCS, I will not allow the police to share the compound with the CDF team." Nandalwe drummed up support for Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya presidential aspirant Raila Odinga saying Kenya Kwanza brigade has no agenda for Kenyans. He urged youths to avoid politicians who only use them for their personal political interest and then dump them after winning. He said he has no competitor in the parliamentary race, saying the incumbent MP John Waluke is facing a court case. “Sirisia cannot vote for a criminal again, we want a leader with a clean track record and who is dedicated to serve and bring development,” Nandalwe said.
