The discord between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto was at play once again as they both graced the National prayer breakfast. The President who previously shared a table with his deputy and speakers of the National Assembly and Senate sat on a different table. This time around, Uhuru shared his table with Chief Justice Martha Koome and Attorney General Paul Kihara. DP Ruto, on the other hand, shared his table with speakers Kenneth Lusaka and Justin Muturi, who are both members of his Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The two speakers are the hosts of the national prayer breakfast. Uhuru and Ruto do not see eye-to-eye and have in the last three public meetings avoided shaking hands. The two have been embroiled in a public spat that revealed the deep discord in the Jubilee administration. This began soon after the head of state had a handshake with former Prime minister Raila Odinga. The Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate did not attend the prayer meeting. The national prayer breakfast saw a section of MPs allied to the two rival camps, Azimio la Umoja and Kenya Kwanza Alliance displayed a show of unity as they presented a song during the prayer meeting held at Safari Park Hotel in Nairobi. The MPs choir was led by nominated Senator Isaac Mwaura and they sang the song, 'Guide me O thou great Jehovah'.
