Embakasi East MP Babu Owino will now be treated as a pariah at Parliament buildings in the next five days for disorderly conduct. The MP will also miss five sittings. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi ordered Sergeants-at-Arms to bar the MP from accessing the chamber, committees, as well any other activity in Parliament. “I direct the MP to withdraw from chamber and precincts for five days inclusive today pursuant to Standing Order 107,” Muturi said. “If he is not in the chamber today, he will not be allowed to access precincts, chamber, committee, or any House activities." Babu was punished for refusing to heed orders to vacate the chamber on April 14 when Wajir Woman MP Fatuma Gedi sought to table documents on land grabbing allegations against DP William Ruto. “It has not escaped the attention of the members that he refused to leave. Due to the gross misconduct, I deferred the ruling to today.” “For the committees, let it be noted that he will not attend as a member of the public. The proceedings of any committee that allows him to sit would be rendered a nullity,” Muturi said.
