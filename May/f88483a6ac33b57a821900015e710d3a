Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala now wants Deputy President William Ruto to stop interfering with Kakamega politics. Speaking at a rally in Kakamega on Wednesday, Malala asked Ruto not to allow his UDA party to field candidates in Western Kenya. The Senator, who is now eyeing the governor seat, says they are determined to deliver the 70 per cent of Western votes but said UDA fielding candidates in Kakamega and Western at large will affect their performance. "We have respected UDA and given them top seats. Honourable William Ruto, stop being interested in our local seats. We also want ANC to have leaders as that is the only way we will have respect for each other," Malala said at a rally in Mumias. "You have told us to get 70 per cent of the votes so that we can get the 30 per cent share of government. That 70 per cent must also include MPs. We need our leaders for that target." Mudavadi and Wetangula are expected to deliver  70 per cent to get the chief cabinet secretary post and National Assembly speaker seats respectively. They will also be given 30 per cent of cabinet seats. “We have given you top seats please don’t interfere with our bedrooms,” Malala added. Malala's sentiments came days after the UDA party fielded a parliamentary candidate in the Sabatia constituency, the home of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. The move caused murmurs in the Kenya Kwanza alliance with leaders demanding the withdrawal of the UDA candidate Clement Siloya.
