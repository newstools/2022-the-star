Sweet potato fries are slightly higher in calories and carbs but also have more nutrients than normal French fries. Sweet potatoes are a great source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. In this recipe, we opted to bake rather than frying. Baking is the more healthy way to cook food. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Cut your sweet potatoes into ¼ inch square fry-shaped pieces. Try and be consistent in the thickness of the potato for properly cooked potatoes. Step 2 Fill a bowl with water and place the sweet potatoes. Cover and let them soak for at least 30 minutes. Step 3 After the sweet potatoes soak, remove them from the water and pat dry with a clean dishtowel Step 4 Add the dry sweet potatoes to a large bowl and drizzle with the oil. Toss well to coat evenly. Step 5 In a separate bowl, combine the corn starch, garlic powder, and paprika. Corn starch adds additional crunch when cooked. Sprinkle the mixture over the oiled sweet potatoes and toss again to evenly coat. Step 6 (optional for baking) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Then spread the sweet potatoes in an even layer on a baking sheet. Then bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and flip every fry over, one by one. Then return to bake for 15 minutes. Step 7 Fry them until they start browning. Step 8 Remove from heat then sprinkle with salt. Do not add salt until after cooking Let the fries rest for 5 minutes before serving warm with a burger or cold beverage.
