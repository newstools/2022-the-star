Kakamega Homeboyz wasted a glorious opportunity to return to the top of the Kenyan Premier League Standings following a 2-0 defeat to AFC Leopards at Bukhungu Stadium on Sunday. Ingwe had an instant reaction to an early scare as an unusual scorer in Collins Shivachi poked home the ball from close range with Homeboyz goalkeeper Stephen Otieno, off his line. Ingwe had their second attempt on goal in the 28th minute through Ojo Olaniyi, who tested Otieno on the near post with a feeble header. Homeboyz centre-back Brian Eshihanda — a forward in his formative years — missed the back of net by a whisker in the 36th minute as his header flew just inches over the bar with Otieno well beaten. Leopards, who engaged a higher gear as soon as they emerged from the tunnel, threatened seven minutes into the half but Eugene Mukangula's hard-drilled shot swayed off the target. Homeboyz threw in Michael Karamor in the 54th minute for Mike Isabwa, who struggled to track back and aid the defence whenever Leopards were on break. Laxity in the Homeboyz area saw Olaniyi double the lead a minute later as the Nigerian forward was granted space to shoot by the scattered defenders inside the box. Homeboyz rung the second change in the 67th minute when Gaetan Masha was rested for Stephen Opoku as coach Mwalala sought to add more punch in his forward line. Homeboyz needed a win to go three points clear of defending champions Tusker but the setback means they will have to win their remaining matches against Talanta and Kariobangi Sharks. They will also depend heavily on Tusker's stumble in their remaining two matches against Bidco United and Posta Rangers.
