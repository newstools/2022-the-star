Tanzanian superstar Diamond Platnumz is buying a private jet to make his international travel easy. Diamond, who is currently in Ivory Coast on a world tour to promote his EP, FOA (First of all), said he is not buying the jet for show-off. "I am buying a jet not because I want to show off but because I have to," he said. "Look at my world tours now, I have a lot of shows, I have to be flying like sometimes to three different countries. "If you look at the number of people I am travelling with and the amount I spend on airlines, it is best if I buy my own jet. And I will be saving a lot of money." He will own the jet before his birthday in October. A few days ago, Diamond said he is planning to buy himself a private jet this year while wishing his manager Sallam SK a happy birthday. Diamond shared a file photo of the day he purchased a brand new zero mileage 2021 Rolls Royce Black Badge, saying it was his dream car. In June last year, Diamond bought two Cardilac Escadales, estimated to be approximately Sh32 million each. The vehicles, with zero mileage covered, were delivered to the singer's home in Tanzania. In the same year, Diamond spent Sh5.2 million ($48,000) to buy a new chain bearing his nickname 'Simba', complete with a pendant depicting the head of a lion. Diamond took to his Instagram page to flaunt the chain.
