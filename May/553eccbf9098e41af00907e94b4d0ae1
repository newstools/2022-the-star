Mathira Member of Parliament Rigathi Gachagua says he is ready to work with the Deputy President William Ruto to deliver Kenyans from economic oppression. Speaking after being fronted as the DP's running mate in Karen, Nairobi, Gachagua said he is ready to support the DP to champion economic empowerment in the country. “I am supporting him to champion economic empowerment. What brought us together is to revive our economy,” Gachagua, who hails from Nyeri County, said. Kenya Kwanza Alliance had faced a stalemate after both Gachagua and Tharaka Nithi senator Kithure Kindiki maintained a hardline stance on the running mate slot. But after the 17-hour talks, the alliance settled on Gachagua, an announcement that was made in absence of Kindiki. In his speech, the DP had said that they had come up with an economic forum that is to be held across Kenya as that is their priority once they get hold of the office after the August polls. Gachagua was on the spot given his first task which is to work with Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria to offer political leadership to the economic team. Gachagua further said he is honoured by the responsibility and faith that have been bestowed upon him during the most defining election. "The trust and confidence you have shown in me is immense. I will not let you (DP), the hustler nation, and the people of Kenya down," he said in his speech. "This is one of the greatest days of my life and with humility I thank God for the favour he has shown me," he added. Gachagua vowed to help Ruto see through all his aspirations for Kenyans and to ensure he delivers on his hustler agenda. "With the team, you have assembled, I believe we have what it takes to realise the dreams of the hustler nation and it will be a great honour for me to play my part," he said
