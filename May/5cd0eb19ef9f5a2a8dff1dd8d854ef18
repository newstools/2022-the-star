Operating income grew by 21 per cent to Sh30.9 billion up from Sh25.5 billion with non-funded income constituting 37.2 per cent of the operating income. Equity managing director James Mwangi attributed the growth to a clear development strategy and adoption and usage of digital transaction capabilities. "The defensive strategy involved internally generated cash being retained while forgoing dividend payouts for two consecutive years to build capital buffers," Mwangi said. He noted the strategy collectively yielded an increase in shareholder funds to Sh176.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, up from Sh111.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. Net loans grew 28 per cent to Sh623.6 billion up from Sh487.7 billion while investments in government securities grew by 50 per cent to Sh389.4 billion up from Sh258.9 billion.

Cash and cash equivalents declined by 31 per cent from Sh241 billion down to Sh166.4 billion as the Group resumed aggressive lending. Asset reallocation from cash and cash equivalents to interest-earning assets resulted in net interest income growth of 31 per cent to Sh19.4 billion up from Sh14.8 billion with a yield on earning assets growing to 9.5 per cent up from 8.9 per cent. Regional subsidiaries continued to gain market share with their total revenue contribution to the Group growing to 40 per cent (Sh12.8 billion) up from 37 per cent (Sh9.6 billion). The subsidiaries increased their profit after-tax contribution to 30 per cent (Sh3.6 billion) of the Group’s profit after tax up from 21 per cent (Sh 1.9 billion). Return on average equity for subsidiaries stood at 23.6 per cent against a cost of the capital ratio of 21 per cent with both Equity Bank Uganda and Equity Bank Rwanda joining Equity Bank Kenya to register return on average assets of above four per cent. This is despite the asset reallocation liquidity marginally declining to 56.9 per cent down from 60.6 per cent which reflects the size of headroom and the opportunity for continued optimization of assets allocation and loan growth. “The first quarter of 2022 is a demonstration of the strategy Equity is executing which is developmental.
