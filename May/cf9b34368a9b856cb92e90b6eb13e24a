Tunisian President Kaïs Saïed has announced plans to rewrite his country's constitution. In a televised Eid address, Mr Saïed, who has dissolved government and parliament, said a committee would be established to redraft the existing framework and would conclude its work within days. He did not specify how the constitution would be changed, but said it would usher in what he called a New Republic. Opponents have accused him of seeking to concentrate all the levers of power in his own hands since he seized power nine months ago.
