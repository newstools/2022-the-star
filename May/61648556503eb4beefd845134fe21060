Mt Elgon MP Fred Kapondi came under scathing attack from Kenya Kwanza leaders for allegedly backing an Azimio governor candidate Wycliffe Wangamati for the Bungoma gubernatorial seat. Speaking in Cheptais, the leaders Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang'ula termed the move as hypocrisy and out to weaken deputy president William Ruto. "There is no way you will say we vote Azimio down and at the top vote Ruto," said Wetang'ula. Wetang'ula told residents to reject such leaders who are dining in Kenya Kwanza during the day and at night, hiding with the Azimio brigade. His sentiments were echoed by Musalia Mudavadi who castigated Kapondi for playing politics of deceit. He called on residents to only vote for Kenya Kwanza candidates and avoid those who are associating with Azimio. "For Ruto to be strong he needs soldiers. Don't vote for those saying vote for Ruto and mix up candidates at the bottom," Musalia said. Kapondi has been publicly campaigning for Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati who is the DAP-K candidate. In a past public forum, he has described Wangamati as a friend who they schooled with and a development conscious leader. Kapondi is fighting out with Evans Chemwotei of Ford Kenya, Jane Chebet - Independent and Allan Chemayek - Independent for the Mt Elgon seat.
