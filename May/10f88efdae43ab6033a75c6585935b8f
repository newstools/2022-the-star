Strathmore Gladiators' forward Brian Nyabuto returned to training yesterday ahead of Kenya Hockey Union men's Premier League against Western Jaguars on May 28 in Kakamega. Nyabuto, 21, sustained an ankle injury on May 5  in their 3-2 loss to Kenya Police in the Gold Cup Club Invitational tournament at the Dashmesh Stadium, along the Forest Road. He missed the final match against USIU-A Mashujaa a day later in which they lost 1-0 to finish fourth in the week-long four-team tournament. Initially, it was feared that the fleet-footed buccaneering forward will be on the treatment table for an extended period of time.  His availability is good music to Gladiators tactician Meshack Senge's ears "I have followed the instructions of the physios to date and I feel better. Let's see how the training will go on," Nyabuto said. He added: "I want to get back to the level I was before the injury. I have got enough time to be fully fit for the Jaguars clash." Nyabuto managed three goals in four matches in the tournament to underline his importance to the former national champions. As the Gladiators' vice-captain, Nyabuto is tasked with filling the void left by proven scorer Festus Onyango who joined Butali. The BCom student has propelled Strath to the third spot on the table with 10 points from five matches.
