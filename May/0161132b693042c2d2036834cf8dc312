Maringo-Hamza MCA Mark Ndung’u has obtained orders directing Jubilee Party to issue him with a nomination certificate to run for the Makadara parliamentary seat. This is after a Political Dispute Tribunal sitting in Kakamega agreed with his petition. The tribunal issued the orders on May 19. The party’s intention to appeal the ruling on Friday was dismissed. Jubilee was ordered to forward Ndung'u name to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. The MCA had been denied the certificate following an earlier plan by Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance to zone Nairobi in a bid to reap maximum seats possible in the August polls. In the zoning arrangement, ODM’s George Aladwa was given a direct ticket under the coalition to defend his seat. The move saw incumbent and known Nairobi bigwigs handed the tickets for various elective seats in the City, dimming the hopes of tens of aspirants who were eying the Azimio ticket. A section of aspirants has however come out publicly to oppose zoning considering they had paid nomination fees. Aggrieved aspirants largely from Jubilee faulted Azimio’s decision saying a nomination exercise should have been conducted as opposed to the issuance of direct tickets. Ndungu, who was among the aspirants, said he and dozens of aspirants paid nomination fees to the party and it was wrong for them to fail to reimburse the funds. “I am not alone. We are many. The party took our money and failed to issue us with the certificates under the zoning issue,” he said. The order by the tribunal could set the stage for more aspirants to seek its audience in a bid to have their respective parties compelled to issue them with tickets.
