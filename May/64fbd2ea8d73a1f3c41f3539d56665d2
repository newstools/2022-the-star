Police officers attached to various VIPs as bodyguards have something to smile about after authorities opened a new changing room for them. The changing room complex located at the Security of Government Buildings Unit will, among others, facilitate officers' change of shifts at Uhuru Camp. “The room will be a resting and recreation facility for officers,” said Noor Gabow, Deputy Inspector General of Administration Police Service,  when he opened the facility. Some of the officers attached as bodyguards have complained of mistreatment and lack of rest when with their subjects. Gabow also inspected ongoing projects and said that upon completion, the facilities will accord officers dignity and contribute to improved productivity. The facilities include a mess, housing units and an administration complex. He praised the officers for their good work in safeguarding the country and urged them to be vigilant during the election period. Under APS, there is Rapid Deployment Unit, Border Police Unit, Anti-Stock Theft Unit, Security of Government Buildings Unit and Critical Infrastructure Protection Unit. The service is currently rushing to complete projects started under the current administration. On Wednesday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i and IG Hilary Mutyambai inspected the construction of National Police Service Mbagathi Hospital. The facility with a 110-bed capacity will provide specialised care for police officers and will be ready for opening in June, barely 10 months since its commissioning. Matiang'i said he was delighted with the developments so far. The service is also building a level 6 hospital in Kanyonyo, Kitui county. It is set for opening in late June by President Uhuru Kenyatta. (edited by Amol Awuor)
