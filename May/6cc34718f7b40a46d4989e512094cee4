DCI should stop playing politics in Nominated MP David Sankok son's death investigation, Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has said. Memusi Sankok, 15, allegedly shot himself dead with a gun last week. “We want to ask the agency to be empathetic with this family since they are having a hard time,” Gachagua said. “Losing a son at this young age is very traumatic. The family has done everything needed…postmoterm has also been done and investigations concluded on cause of death.” Speaking after condoling with the family of Sankok on Saturday, Gachagua said as much as the investigations were not clear, the DCI should allow the family to mourn their child. “DCI should give them time and only come back after the burial. Subjecting the family to recording many statements is inhuman," he said. “We urge the DCI to exercise understanding and let them bury their child in peace. Let the officers exercise professionalism.” Sankok was grilled for the second time on Thursday over the death of his son in Narok County. Detectives went to record a further statement from Sankok over what they termed as 'inconsistencies'. The team has so far recorded statements from at least 10 people including Sankok, his wife, children and workers. "It was as they went through the statements they detected inconsistencies hence the need for clarification," police said. The probe file will be sent to the Office of Director of Public Prosecution with various recommendations for action. This comes as the focus has shifted to the ballistic analysis of two guns belonging to Sankok following the death of Memusi. Police took his shotgun and Ceska pistol found in the house for analysis and examination.
