A mother and son were on Monday mauled to death by two dogs in Simur Sub Location, Ugenya Sub County. Caren Akinyi Aluoch, 28, and her one-year-old son were bitten and killed by stray dogs in the Siranga trading centre. They were hybrid dogs. The dogs belonged to Felix Omach, a Catholic father in the region. Omach has since escaped to Uganda. The killer dogs were starving following their owner's absence. Residents told the Star that Akinyi, who was mauled was not mentally stable. "The woman has her origins in Alego. She was mentally unstable and has a habit of rising up very early and strolling the streets," a resident said. According to the home’s manager, the fierce dogs had escaped from their cages on Sunday night and attempts to trace them were futile. Ugenya deputy OCPD James Ngao confirmed the incident. “The home manager reported that the dogs had broken out of the homestead. The woman and her child were found Monday morning having been mauled by the cruel dogs,” Ngao said. Locals beat the dogs to death. The bodies of the lady and her son have been taken to Ukwala Sub County Hospital Mortuary.
