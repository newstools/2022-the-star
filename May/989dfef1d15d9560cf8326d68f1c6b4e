A bar manager is nursing injuries at a Migori hospital after three revellers allegedly attacked him at his premise on Thursday night. Oscar Omondi, 28, the manager of Azimio bar in Karangi, Migori County, was attacked by three machete-wielding revellers as he was about to close the bar. "He was attacked after he prevented the revellers from leaving for the night with a newly employed bar waitress," DCI said on Twitter. Omondi is said to have raised concerns following the high turnover of waitresses at his place of work because many of them had eloped with revellers. "He was determined not to let the current one go," DCI said. According to the detectives, the trio was at the bar for the better part of the evening and would occasionally steal glances at the 22-year-old waitress who was serving the customers. "Unbeknownst to them, the bar manager had taken note of their eye movements and the witty remarks that would follow." And despite finishing their drinks an hour before the closing time, the trio remained in the bar. The police say the bar manager warned the suspects against leaving with the young woman, and this upset the men. "He didn’t know that the three were armed with machetes, knives and other crude weapons," DCI said. The trio is said to have descended on the bar manager with machetes, knives and clubs before breaking into the counter and making away with an unspecified amount of money. Detectives based in Migori have launched a manhunt for the suspects, who are well known by the locals.
