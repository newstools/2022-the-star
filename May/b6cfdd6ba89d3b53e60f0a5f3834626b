Aspirants who will engage in activities that breach peace ahead of the August polls will face the law, the Kitui county security committee warned on Tuesday. Chairperson Mbogai Rioba, who is also the county commissioner, said there will be no mercy or leniency for leaders who incite others to engage in election violence. “Avoid messages that give negative energy that may cause disharmony among people. We want to have peace because this country is ours and we will have it even after the elections,” Rioba said. He spoke to the media after meeting the clergy from Kitui who are organising a peace prayer session in the county on Friday. “Anybody who breaks the law will be answerable," Rioba said. He was accompanied by, among others, the head of the Akamba united clergy Bishop Peter Mwangangi. Rioba said the church is concerned about security in the country and is working with government agencies to ensure peace prevails throughout the electioneering period. He said all is set for Friday peace prayers and all politicians have been invited.
