Gor Mahia head coach Andreas Spier says he intends to maintain the lineup that beat KCB last week when they come up against Kariobangi Sharks at Thika Stadium this afternoon. A hard-fought 1-0 win over KCB at the same venue last Saturday fired the record Kenyan champions to the fourth spot on the log, effectively reigniting their hopes for a 20th Kenyan Premier League title. They have accumulated 45 points thus far, 10 adrift of leaders Kakamega Homeboyz. Spier reckons there is no need to ring the changes in the lineup that delivered victory in their last outing. “We've had good preparations throughout the week. I will keep the same team that won last weekend,” Spier told the club's official portal. Skipper Philemon Otieno has said they are not worried about their opponent's impressive form, adding they are confident of posting some positive results. Otieno urged K'Ogalo's massive fan base to turn up in large numbers and give them the necessary impetus in the crucial encounter. “We know they (Sharks) have been performing well recently, but they are facing Gor Mahia,” Otieno said. “To our fans, we are yet to see you back in the stadium. Come on Sunday and offer us support,” he added. Mercurial striker, Benson Omalla, expressed optimism ahead of Sunday's duel. “This is a big game for us because the table is taking shape and we need maximum points. I think the race is still open,” Omalla said. The last time the two sides flexed muscles, Gor Mahia were the better team, collecting a comfortable 2-0 with goals from Benson Omalla and Peter Lwasa. Gor also boast a better head to head record, having won seven of the 10 league games against Sharks. The two clubs are currently separated by a solitary point. Whereas Gor Mahia are fourth with 45 points from 26 games, Sharks are place fifth with 44 points from the same number of games. Editing by Tony Mballa
