Nominated MP David Sankok was on Thursday grilled for the second time over the death of his son in Narok County. Detectives went to record a further statement from Sankok over what they termed as 'inconsistencies'. Memusi Sankok, 15, allegedly shot himself dead with a gun. But it is not clear what the detectives handling the matter got from Sankok in his statement. The team has so far recorded statements from at least 10 people including Sankok, his wife, children and workers. "It was as they went through the statements they detected inconsistencies hence the need for clarification," police said. The probe file will be sent to the Office of Director of Public Prosecution with various recommendations for action. This comes as the focus has shifted to the ballistic analysis of two guns belonging to Sankok following the death of Memusi. Police took his shotgun and Ceska pistol found in the house for analysis and examination. They also collected shells believed to have been discharged from the shotgun, which now they believe Memusi used to blow up his head. An autopsy conducted on the body revealed the cause of Memusi’s death was a gunshot to the chin that exited through the head. Police are planning to recommend that Sankok be charged with negligence in handling his firearm. A licensed firearm holder is always supposed to ensure the safety of their gun. Apart from the charges, the team handling the case also plans to recommend an inquest into the boy's death.
