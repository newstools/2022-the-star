Juma Jux has told his ex-girlfriend Vanessa to call him when she misses him although she is married. In an interview with Wasafi Media, Jux said he doesn't write songs for a specific person, but admitted 'Sio Mbaya' was a breakup song. "We can break up but we don't have to be enemies because life goes on. If you miss me, call me, you can be with your guy," he said. He said he might have a deal that can help her, so no need to throw shade at one another. "After the relationship, it's not a must to create hate or enmity," he said. Jux recently released 'Simuachi' featuring Huddah Monroe as a video vixen. He clarified that he and Huddah are just friends even though they are seen kissing in the video.
