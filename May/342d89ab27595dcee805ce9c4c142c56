Over 80 golfers will converge at the Karen Golf Club for the 7th leg of the Safaricom Tour this weekend. The two-day event will tee off on Friday and has attracted golfers from Nairobi and its environs. Senior players will compete on Friday with the juniors taking to the stage on Saturday alongside the junior golf clinic. “It is really exciting to host our seventh leg of the tour at Karen. I am glad to see how our golf series continues to identify, tap and nurture new talents, especially at the regional level. This indeed proves that what many of our young people need is an avenue where they can showcase their talent,” said Peter Ndegwa, the Safaricom chief executive officer. The Safaricom Golf Tour which teed off in January 2022 has seen close to 2,000 golfers participating in the corporate, caddie, and junior tournaments.  Another 2,000 youngsters have also been engaged through golf clinics and outreach programmes. So far, the tour has been held in six locations namely Nanyuki, Limuru, Muthaiga, Nyanza, Machakos, and Eldoret. Safaricom has also partnered with Junior Golf Foundation to continue tapping and nurturing young talent in the sport. The juniors can register with Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) for Sh1,000 and will have access to any golf club in the country.
