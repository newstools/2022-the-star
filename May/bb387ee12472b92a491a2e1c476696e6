Bandari's quest to close in on joint leaders Tusker and Kakamega Homeboyz suffered a setback after they settled for a barren draw against Ulinzi Stars at Kericho Green Stadium on Saturday. The dockers squandered a perfect opportunity to devour their opponents who ran out of gas after being reduced to nine men. This was after Benard Ongoma and Brian Birgen were sent for early showers by centre referee Lucas Odhiambo following grave infringements. The outcome leaves Bandari third on the log with 54 points, three adrift of Homeboyz and Tusker. The soldiers who have experienced a torrid run this season, remain rooted in the bottom-half of the table at 13th with 34 points. Editing by Tony Mballa
