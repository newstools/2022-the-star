United Democratic Alliance parliamentary aspirant Zaheer Jhanda has asked Nyaribari Chache MP Richard Tong'i to prepare for a stiff competition ahead of the August polls. Jhanda said it was time for a change. He said he was optimistic he will unseat Tong'i. The politician who came second in the 2017 polls said he won but was rigged out. “We can not afford a situation where the leadership dwells on clanisism," Jhanda said. The aspirant spoke on Wednesday at a Kisii hotel. Jhanda said if elected, he will concentrate on agriculture, education, health, roads and water sectors. He said some areas in development had been ignored. “All residents have a right for service irrespective of whom they voted for,” Jhanda said. Others in the race are James Kenani, veteran journalist Eric Obino, former Kisii Roads executive Vincent Sagwe and Kiogoro MCA Samuel Apoko among others. He told off some leaders who dwelled on his colour and tribe, telling voters not to elect him. “Jhanda was born in Kisii, schooled there and lived and is married there,” the politician said. He called for peaceful campaigns saying the decision to elect the next MP lies in hands of the electorate. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
