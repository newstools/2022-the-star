Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Commercial Bank will put their friendship on the line when they face off in the semifinals of the African Women’s Club Volleyball Championships, in Tunisia in an all-Kenyan affair on Monday. Pipeline, six-time African champions, hope to end their 17-year title drought, with their most recent success being a bronze medal at the 2019 tournament. Paul Gitau’s Pipeline have been transformed with a blend of youth and experience, making the dream of glory again. Pipeline beat Cameron’s FAP in quarters in straight sets while the bankers, against all odds, floored Kenya Prisons by the same scoreline. KCB, who finished second in Pool 'B', last won the title in 2006 under coach Paul Bitok with silver medals at the 2007 and 2008 editions. KCB head coach, Japheth Munala, expects a tough encounter. “I'm extremely elated with the girls' achievements thus far. Kenya Prisons are a very good team and beating them in the quarters was a tough assignment. The going doesn't get any easier as Pipeline awaits," Munala said. "They boast quality but with the same desire, we stand a real chance of playing in the finals. How nice it will be to lift the prestigious trophy because it's been a while since we won." “I am so proud of this team and our technical bench for guiding us well. We can’t wait to play in the semis and hopefully win and go to the final,” KCB captain Mercy Moim said. Record Champions AL Ahly from Egypt will settle scores with Tunisia’s Carthage in the other semifinal. Al Ahly are the most successful team in the competition with eight trophies while Carthage are the defending champions. The Tunisians beat KCB 3-0 while Al Ahly outclassed Pipeline 3-1.
