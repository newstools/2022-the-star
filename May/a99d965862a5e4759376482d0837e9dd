A mysterious fire has razed down two dormitories in Sameta Primary school in Kisii. No pupil was injured while property worth millions of shillings was destroyed. The 82 pupils who slept in the affected dorms escaped unhurt in the Monday night incident. Headteacher Ibrahim Ondati refused to speculate on the possible cause of the fire when journalists visited the school. He was not where the fire broke out at 7 PM on Monday. He told journalists to visit the office of the director of education for further details. Distraught parents said they received distress calls about the fire at the school. "Everything on sight is leaked up by the fire as you can see. It is a big loss but we are happy our children are safe," said one mother to a standard 7 pupil. Burnt boxes and books littered outside dormitories when journalists arrived Tuesday afternoon. Some parents were seen driving away with their children. Sameta Deputy County Commissioner Muroki Muyuri said it was lucky no pupil was injured in the incident. They are however investigating arson. The fire had broken out when there was no electricity at the school, he said. "Already officers from the DCI have visited the scene and will act on the report they will give us," he said.
