Former Cabinet minister Fred Gumo has hailed Azimio Presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga’s choice of Narc Kenya leader Martha as his running mate. Gumo said the choice will greatly solidify his lead over Deputy President William Ruto. He said the choice of Karua had tilted opinion polls in Odinga’s favour, days after the Azimio leader made the announcement. Gumo spoke in Endebes on Friday when he addressed a mammoth rally where he campaigned for Odinga, Azimio governor aspirant for Trans Nzoia George Natembeya and his son Pius Omjujo who is vying for the Endebes Parliamentary seat. He said the target given to Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Moses Wetangula to deliver 70 votes to Kenya Kwanza is unrealistic. "From which constituencies shall the two be able to raise the required percentage of votes for Kenya Kwanza in order to be allocated the imaginary positions?" he asked. He said a 30 per cent stake in the government amounts to a political conmanship since it is impossible. Both Odinga and Karua, according to Gumo, are the best combination that can steer the country's economy after the August 9, polls. He said Deputy President William Ruto’s choice of Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua will have no major impact owing to several cases of corruption facing him.
