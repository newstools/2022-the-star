Azimio la Umoja One Kenya presidential aspirant Raila Odinga on Wednesday toured Vihiga County, a day after Kenya Kwanza Alliance leaders Musalia Mudavadi and Moses Wetang’ula led campaigns in the Western region. Upon arrival, the Azimio flagbearer held a meeting at Sosa Cottage in Hamisi subcounty where he met various leaders to strategise on his campaigns in the region. Raila will later hold a rally to drum up support for his presidential bid ahead of the August 9 polls. The ODM boss is accompanied by Kisumu governor Anyang' Nyong'o, Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya and former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende. Others are Senator George Khaniri, CS Eugene Wamalwa, Suna East MP Junet Mohamed, nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi, among other leaders. Raila is seeking to galvanise the support of voters in Vihiga County to boost his bid in the region. He ​is ​set to hold several campaigns to water down Kenya Kwanza's influence in the region. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo said Raila is expected to hold rallies at Shamakhokho, Cheptulu, Mudete, Chavakali, Mbale town, Majengo, Mahanga, Esibuye and a final rally in Luanda at Mumboha grounds. Organisers indicated that Raila was keen to address concerns around zoning in the county. Vihiga County, Mudavadi's backyard, has traditionally voted for the ODM leader but the dynamics changed after Mudavadi and Wetang'ula joined Kenya Kwanza. The entry of the duo into the DP Wiliam Ruto-led outfit could tilt the equation in the DP's favour as Wetang'ula and Mudavadi pull all stops to deliver at least 70 per cent of the vote from the region for Ruto.
