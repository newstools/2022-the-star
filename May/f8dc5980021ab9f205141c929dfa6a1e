Nairobi's nightclub the Alchemist has apologised after claims of racism surfaced on social media over the weekend. The club was accused of discriminating against its black customers. In a statement, the joint said that the management had reached out to the individuals who posted the video on social media to get more information on the incident. "The management of The Alchemist is aware of the video circulating and has reached out to the individuals to get more information." Alchemist has also apologised for the incident, " To anyone that has felt aggrieved, we sincerely apologise and we look forward to sitting down together and addressing these issues head-on." "Since we opened our doors, The Alchemist has always been a home to creators, partners, musicians and customers from all different backgrounds," the statement read. The video that circulated on social media showed the bouncers at the club had directed separate queues, allegedly according to their races. "This is racist, I swear... I wanted to record," a man was heard saying. The bar also released CCTV footage of that night. "We have reviewed footage from the alleged incident and we’ve shared it for everyone to see." This is not the first time the bar is accused of racism. Earlier, a customer alleged that she was denied a sitting space as it was reserved for white people.
