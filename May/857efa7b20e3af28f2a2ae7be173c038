The director of a Nairobi club is now demanding Tanzanian singer Harmonize and his team refund the money his customers paid for his concert on Saturday night. Speaking in an interview with Citizen TV,  the club director Joe Barsil claimed that Harmonize appeared on stage for less than a minute and left. "He should have even stayed in the club but my biggest complaint is the whole team's conspiracy to defraud. Cause I paid money and we never received the service," Barsil added. The Director said that his customers at the club did not receive the services they expected. Barsil affirmed that the contract clarifies that an artist is supposed to appear for a minimum of one and half hours, meaning there is no technical appearance allowed as Eric Omondi had said concerning the concert. Omondi and a certain promoter, have also been implicated in the matter. The Tanzanian Bongo artist has been arrested and is being held at Kileleshwa Police Station for allegedly skipping stage appearance time in various Nairobi Clubs. Barsil further said that the total cost of the club set up and Harmonize's appearances cost around Sh1.45 million.
