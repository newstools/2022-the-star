Kiambu county has embarked on educating secondary school students about the importance of growing trees. The idea is to enable them take care of the environment throughout their lives. "We want our students to understand the importance of trees as part of environment when they are young. What we aim at achieving will stick in their minds and will pass it on to other generations,” Environment executive David Kuria said. “They will live not only planting trees but also taking care of them. If that cycle goes well, this country will never cry again over destruction of forests and environment." He spoke at Gatamaiyu High School in Nyanduma ward in Lari constituency on Tuesday, where 1,000 indigenous trees seedlings were planted. He was accompanied by environmentalists from Kijabe Environmental Volunteers Organisation and International Tree Foundation, among others. Kuria said they have more than 300,000 indigenous seedlings that will be distributed to secondary schools in the county, as they train students on environmental issues. Kenvo director Nelson Muiru said they had embraced the strategy and were partnering also with other organisations and the government through the Kenya Forest Service. He further said they are working hand in hand with KFS and the Community Forest Associations to approach issues regarding forests, breeding of seedlings and developing seedbeds.
