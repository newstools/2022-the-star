The woes facing the newly-elected Cricket Kenya (CK) office are far from over. This is after it emerged the Sports Disputes Tribunal has called for the transfer of Sh12 million from the CK account to a personal-joint account. The Tribunal, chaired by John Ohaga, ordered that CK surrenders the kitty after former Cricket Kenya Umpires Secretary Walter Trenk Mukinginyi sued the Sports Registrar, Cricket Kenya Normalisation Committee members and members of the Cricket Kenya Independent Election Panel protesting the results of elections that ushered in the new office on February 26. The money will be deposited to an account jointly held by former national team captain Pearlyne Omamo, Brenda Mogusu and Sports Registrar Rose Wasike (or Senior Sports Officer Solomon Mbogo as an alternative to the Registrar). The money, the Tribunal ruled, will be used to facilitate the participation of the national women’s team in the International Cricket Council (ICC)-sanctioned Kwibuka tournament slated for June 7-19 in Kigali, Rwanda. “It is herby ordered funds in the amount of Ksh 12, 437, 300 currently held in the Cricket Kenya account be released to the three signatories approved by this Tribunal for the purpose of preparations for and participation of the Kenya national women’s team in the International Cricket Council-sanctioned Kwibuka tournament in Rwanda,” the ruling reads. Kajiado Cricket Association secretary Joseph Awino also moved to court to challenge the outcome of the elections, suing the Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed, the chairperson of Cricket Kenya Normalisation Committee Lady Justice (Rtd) Joyce Aluoch, the Independent Elections Panel of Cricket Kenya chairman Kenneth Mutuma, the Sports Registrar and the Attorney General. During the poles, Manoj Patel was elected CK chairman after garnering 51 votes.
