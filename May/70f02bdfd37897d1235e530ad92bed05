Sina Msindiago is deaf and mute, but has not given up on life. The 44-year-old wakes up everyday to report to her makeshift stall, where she sells confectioneries opposite GPO in Nairobi. If you want to buy sweets, biscuits, cigarette or a face mask from her, you just point it out and she gestures the amount you are supposed to pay. Her phone number is also on display if you want to pay using your handset. If you know sign language, you could be lucky. Msindiago is a mother to four children who are in classes seven, six, three and one. She told the Star in an interview, through gestures, that she is widowed and has to toil to put food on the table for her children, and also educate them. Msindiago said she was born well without any disability and hoped life would turnout just fine for her as anybody else, but things changed while growing up. She said she had to accept herself first and be content with what life had thrown her way. One of her children helps her once in a while at the stall when not in school. Msindiago, who lives in Kawangware, said the pace of her business is slow and the fortunes fluctuate. She barely makes a living, she says. She has a phone but strictly for writing messages because can't hear it ring or talk over it. Communicating with customers was hard in early days when she settled at the spot, but because many have known her condition, it is much easier now.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
