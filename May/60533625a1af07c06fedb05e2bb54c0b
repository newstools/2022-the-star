@robertomollo3 Homa Bay county commissioner Moses Lilan has called on governor aspirants Gladys Wanga and Evans Kidero to restrain their supporters from engaging in violence. This comes after a group of youths linked to Wanga and Kidero engaged in violence at Wagwe in Karachuonyo during campaigns. During the Sunday evening incident, 18 motorbikes were damaged. Wanga is the current Homa Bay Woman Representative while Kidero is the former Nairobi governor. They are the only people who have intensified their campaigns for the governor's seat in the county. Lilan said some residents sustained serious head injuries after being attacked with crude weapons. “The two politicians should contain their supporters and avoid violence. We have reached out to them to ensure they engage in peaceful campaigns,” Lilan said. Speaking to journalists in his Homa Bay town office on Monday, the administrator said they have begun investigating the matter to ensure appropriate action is taken. He said only two people have recorded statements. “The matter is being followed very keenly and violence promoters will be punished,” he said. Wanga and Kidero have accused each other of the violence claiming their supporters were attacked. “My supporters including nominated MCA Pamela Odira are among the violence victims. Our opponent hired youths to stone my supporters,” Wanga said. Kidero accused Wanga of engaging in campaign violence saying some of his supporters were injured after being beaten with blunt objects. Through campaign secretariat chairman Sam Omboya, Kidero said youths supporting Wanga had planned to attack them in Karachuonyo rallies. “We’re not pleased with the barbaric act of violence in Wagwe. We should embrace brotherhood and sisterhood during this period because there must be a winner and loser,” Omboya said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
