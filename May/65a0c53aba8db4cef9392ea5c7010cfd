President Macky Sall has said Senegal plans to regulate social media, which Dakarctu website described as "a real cancer of modern societies". “No organised society can accept what is happening here today. We are going to put an end to it, one way or another,” he said. Political tensions during local elections in January led to fears of widespread violence through online mobilisation. Last year, journalists decried online and physical abuse after reporting rape allegations against main opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. His arrest over the case led to rare mass anti-government protests in which at least 13 people killed and several others injured. There are fears that legal measures could be used to crack down on youths using social media to mobilise demonstrations against Mr Sall's administration.
