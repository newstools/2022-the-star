The government is working with other officials to identify the most vulnerable people in society to help them with relief food, an official has said. Garissa county commissioner Boaz Cherutich said each subcounty will receive 150 bags 0f rice (50 kgs), 191 bags of beans (50 kgs) and 137 cartons of con beef from Kemsa. Cherutich said stern action will be taken against administrators diverting relief food meant for vulnerable groups. “We are keen on ensuring that those entrusted with ensuring the relief food gets to the intended person do exactly that. We don't want any monkey business,” he said. The official said members of the public including those from Nyumba Kumi have been urged to be on the lookout and report any government official found selling or stealing relief food. Cherutich said he had instructed the deputy county commissioners to closely work with the committees in their respective areas of jurisdiction and make sure only the deserving people get the food. Several administrators have in the past been charged at the Garissa law court over misappropriation of relief food and other related offences. The official spoke on Tuesday at the Garissa cereals store after launching the relief food distribution exercise to all the 10 subcounties. The drought situation in Garissa has been worsening following the failed March-April rains. According to experts, the situation could worsen in the coming weeks if the rains fail again this month. Garissa is among the 25  counties that are currently faced with severe drought. Last week, the county commissioner warned school heads against sending students home for fees. Cherutich said school heads are under strict instructions to allow all students in schools. He spoke after chairing a county steering committee meeting aimed at assessing the drought situation and coming up with interventions.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
