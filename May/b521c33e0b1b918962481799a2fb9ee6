Butter chicken is a tender, juicy chicken bathed in a rich garlic butter sauce. It is often served with naan, rice or a nice salad, and you’ve got yourself a winning chicken dinner for your friends and family. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 In a large pan, add the olive oil, pounded chicken, evenly season with seasoning, salt, pepper, and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Do not touch, move, or disturb the chicken while it is searing for 5 minutes each side. Step 2 For thicker, bigger chicken breasts, sear for 6-7 minutes until golden brown. Step 3 Remove chicken from heat and place it on a plate to rest. Step 4 Deglaze the same plan by adding wine (or broth) and allowing the liquid to bubble up and steam violently for a few seconds. Step 5 Add in the butter and allow it to melt, about 1 minute, stirring continuously until melted. Step 6 Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken back into the skillet, flip it around in the garlic butter sauce, and spoon the sauce over the chicken. Optionally garnish with parsley and serve immediately.
