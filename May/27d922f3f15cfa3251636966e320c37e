Police in Kabondo Kasipul are investigating the cause of death of a 38-year-old man whose body was found in River Awach. The body of Edwin Ombai was found floating in the river after he went missing last week at Kotienditi village in Kasewe “B” sub-location, Rachuonyo East. The body was discovered by children who had gone to bathe at the river  on Monday morning. They saw Ombai’s body stuck between rocks before they alerted the clan elder. According to Kasewe “B” sub-location senior Assistant Chief Hezbon Asero, the deceased could have been murdered elsewhere before he was into the river. He said the body had visible injuries. Asero said they contacted the family of the deceased and told them the man went missing last Friday. “We’re looking for the suspects by asking residents with information about the whereabouts of people who might have dumped the body into the river,” Asero said. The administrator said the deceased clothes had fresh blood stains indicating that he was attacked. The body injuries showed the suspects used sharp objects in killing the victim. “The body was retrieved from the river with the help of residents and police officers from Othoro station,” Asero said. The body has been moved to Rachuonyo South subcounty hospital for a postmortem. Asero said they are working with DCI, who are investigating the incident. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
