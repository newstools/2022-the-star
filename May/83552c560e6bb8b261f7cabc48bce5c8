A few Kenyan artistes and content creators are set to share the stage with British super actor Idris Elba in Nigeria for the YouTube Africa Day Concert this month. Returning for the third year in a row, YouTube Africa Day concert is part of the Africa Month of Mays lineup. It will feature a number of Africa’s finest music stars. Content creators in Africa will receive support from YouTube through virtual and in-person training and workshops to help them grow their channels and improve their skills. The concert will include an in-person event in Nigeria that will be live-streamed on YouTube, featuring some of the continent’s hottest artistes. The concert will once again commemorate Africa Day by using music as a platform to showcase African culture. Alex Okosi, managing director of Emerging Markets, YouTube EMEA, said they are incredibly proud of YouTube for providing a platform that shares Africa's creativity with the rest of the world. "From music, fashion and beauty to the latest trending movements, YouTube plays an important role in the emergence and expression of Africa's unique cultural stories to local and global audiences," he said. "By commemorating Africa Month through these impactful initiatives, we continue to spotlight and elevate the work of creators and artistes who are at the forefront of the continent's creative explosion." Earlier this year, Angel Lately, Cheymuv, Mandi Sarro and Justus Nandwa were among 26 creators selected from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa who joined the 135 creator-strong 2022 #YouTubeBlack voices creator class. The creators receive seed funding alongside dedicated support to help them develop their channels and thrive on the YouTube platform.
