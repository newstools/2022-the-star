Wiper Party leader, Kalonzo Musyoka has refuted claims that he was mistreated at the State funeral and burial of the late President Mwai Kibaki last week. Speaking at an event in Machakos County on Tuesday, the former Vice President asked politicians to stop speculating on reasons why he was not allowed to address mourners. "I had the privilege to work with him as the Vice President for five years, and attending the burial was enough," he said. Kalonzo said that he was contented with attending the burial of his former boss, adding that it was not a must for him to speak. "Let Mzee Mwai Kibaki rest in peace. Don't make him a subject of debate about whether I was able to speak at his funeral," he added. His statement came after some politicians felt it was unfair and humiliating not to let him give a speech during the burial. Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua had said that the snub amounts to humiliation. "I take great exception to the mishandling of my party leader Kalonzo by state operatives during Kibaki's funeral service at Nyayo Stadium on Friday and the state burial in Othaya on Saturday," Wambua said on Sunday. He said it was not proper for Kalonzo not to be recognised during the two events. "Try all you can, but you won't change history and you won't determine Kalonzo's destiny. We all know that Kalonzo was a loyal, able and effective vice president to Kibaki," Wambua said. Additionally, the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri Anthony Muheria who was presiding over the burial, said the family did not want political speeches during the funeral service.
