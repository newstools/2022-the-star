Deputy President William Ruto now says the Standard Gauge Railway project was invaded by a few influential people to the disadvantage of the Coastal people. Speaking to the media on Tuesday, at his official Karen residence, Ruto said he will ensure the project serves the intended purpose if elected President in the August elections. "It was never the intention of the government of Kenya to build the SGR so that the Coast people can be impoverished," he said. "A few people took the project hostage and created selfish programs that benefit them. We will reverse the impoverishment of the Coast people." Ruto promised that should Kenya Kwanza win the forthcoming elections, they will initiate administrative and legal steps to reverse some aspects of the project's contracts. The DP spoke when officially welcoming Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi to the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. "We as Kenya Kwanza have signed a commitment with PAA on matters they have brought to the table. Matters to do with the land, economy, and public inclusivity of Coast people," Ruto said. The Kenya Kwanza led by the DP agreed to put in place necessary reforms to ensure that Lamu Port brings measurable employment and other economic benefits to the Coast residents.
