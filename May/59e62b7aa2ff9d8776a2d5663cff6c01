Swedish top tier club, AIK Fotboll, have unveiled former AFC Leopards midfielder Collins Shichenje on a whopping four-year deal. This is the second time the towering midfielder is taking a stab at pro football. Prior to penning the deal, he had returned to Kenya in February after a short stint with PAOK in Greece. Sichenje, who cut his teeth at Kakamega High School, becomes the third Kenyan to don AIK colors after Kenyan international left-back Eric Ouma and former Tusker hitman Henry Meja. AIK took to their official website late Wednesday to announce Sichenje's arrival. “AIK Football have agreed with 18-year-old midfielder Sichenje Collins on a contract that extends until December 31, 2026. Collins last played for AFC Leopards SC in Kenya," the club statement read in part. “With Collins, we get a physically fit midfielder who previously proved his mettle at AFC Leopards. Collins has been on the radar of AIK scouts. In March, chief scout Tobias Ackerman visited Africa and watched him in action and was impressed,” club sports director Henrik Jurelius told the club website. Speaking after landing the deal, Sichenje said Ouma and Meja influenced his decision.
