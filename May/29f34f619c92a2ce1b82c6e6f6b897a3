Despite its name, stainless steel can become stained over time. Its accumulation of lime scale and water stains makes it lose its sparkle and look grimy. Steel wool, scrubbing brushes, and abrasive sponges and chemicals can all damage stainless steel, this is why you only need these minimal ingredients. Ingredients: First you want to remove all dishes in the sink. Then rinse it off with water to remove any food residue. Then sprinkle the damp sink with baking soda, both inside and around. Using a wet sponge, scrub the sink, baking soda acts as an abrasive cleaner, but it is gentle enough not to scratch the sink surface. Rinse away the baking soda, then go in with the dish soap. Rinse the sink thoroughly. Get a spray bottle and fill it with vinegar. Vinegar acts as a natural disinfectant and water stain remover.  Buff the vinegar on the sink and surface then go in to polish with a clean cloth.
