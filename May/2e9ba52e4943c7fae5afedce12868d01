Ulinzi Starlets squeezed 2-1 past Nakuru Queens at Ruaraka as the Women's Premier League entered the homestretch on Sunday. Siliya Rasoa gave the soldiers a first-half lead, scoring in the 45th minute to give Joseph Mwanza's Ulinzi a deserved advantage into the breather. Jentrix Kuyudi doubled Ulinzi's lead early in the second half before new signing, Mercy Airo, missed a spot-kick. Nakuru could not be denied either as Nabangala Nyongesa halved the deficit. Ulinzi held on to seal the victory despite a late resurgence from Nakuru. This was Ulinzi's ninth win of the season in 16 matches. The soldiers, who have 33 points, have opened a two-point gap over third-placed Thika Queens. "We didn't utilise our chances and we got punished. We have to play better when we take on Trans Nzoia Falcons by capitalising on home advantage," Nakuru coach Benard Esitoko lamented. In another match, Zetech Sparks came from behind to beat Thika Queens by the same scoreline. A 26th-minute strike from Stella Anyango gave the defending champions Thika a halftime lead. Elizabeth Kisa restored parity for the red-hot Sparks, finding the back of the net in the 56th minute before an own goal from Juliet Andibo in the 70th minute ensured maximum points for Zetech. Sparks coach Benard Kitolo said a second-half tactical change was the catalyst, adding that they have silenced their doubters. Sparks will take one game at a time in order to finish the season strongly. "The changes we made in the second half were the difference. They scored from our defensive mistake but I knew we had another 45 minutes to avoid defeat," Kitolo said. "We have built momentum in the last couple of games and it was a great response from the team. We have beaten Gaspo and Thika, two of the toughest teams in the league and that is a sign that players have finally come off age. We take on Kangemi Ladies in our next match and another win will firmly put us on course to a respectable finish in the  league."
