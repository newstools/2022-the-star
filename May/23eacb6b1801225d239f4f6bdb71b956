Former Transport CAS Chris Obure has told off those claiming he is old to succeed Governor James Ongwae. Obure said age is just a number and proof of experience, adding that it is an indication that he is fit for the office. He said having served in different capacities he understands matters of leadership. He spoke on Monday in Boigesa, Bobasi during the burial of a former teacher Benjamin Mang'uti Mirera. Obure, 78, questioned why people were concerned about his age instead of engaging themselves in other businesses. Others in the race to succeed Ongwae are Dagorreti North MP Simba Arati, his Nyaribari Masaba counterpart Ezekiel Machogu, Senator Sam Ongeri and Manson Oyongo. He urged his competitors to stop assassinating their opponents' character and instead sell their policies and agendas to the people. “It is unwise to do this for political mileage. People will elect the next governor based on ideologies,” he said. Obure and Ongeri are fighting criticism from quotas on account of their old age as they seek to succeed Ongwae. He said the age narrative will not count in the August polls. Obure who drummed up support for Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga during the ceremony called for peaceful campaigns. He said the elections will pass but the country will remain. He urged the youth to shun leaders seeking to use them to disrupt other aspirants' political rallies.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
