The road to State House is long, expensive and exhausting. Becoming a candidate of a major party or coalition is only the beginning of the election process. Successful candidates must persuade voters that they deserve their individual votes. The best way is for those running for the highest office in the land to discuss policy issues and how their proposals will make the lives of Kenyans better. Deputy President William Ruto has said he will reverse some of the decisions his boss, President Uhuru Kenyatta, made while the two were running the government together. ODM leader Raila Odinga has outlined his plans to revive the jua kali (informal) sector, among other reforms. Raila and Ruto are leading the two major coalitions in the August 9 election and their decision to make the campaign issue-based is welcome and should be encouraged. The thousands of aspirants running for elective offices should emulate their leaders. They should tell voters what they stand for and what policies they will put in place if elected. Political competition should be issue-based.
