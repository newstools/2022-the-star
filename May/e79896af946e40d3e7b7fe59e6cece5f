Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale had a rough time selling Deputy President William Ruto at a function in Shinyalu, Kakamega county, on Saturday. A section of the crowd began heckling him after he intended to woo the gathering to back Ruto for the presidency. As he was about to campaign for Ruto, the crowd fired back saying: "Ruto tawe! Ruto tawe!" meaning "Ruto no! Ruto No!" The Senator was forced to cut short his speech and the choir stepped in with a song to calm the seemingly agitated crowd. In his speech, Khalwale, who is seeking the same senate seat in the August 9, polls, had chided the ODM leader Raila Odinga saying he has failed the region. Khalwale noted that the ODM leader forgot the Western region immediately after he sealed the handshake deal with President Uhuru Kenyatta. The former Senator claimed Raila only remembered his Nyanza region on development alleging that he was given a huge budget allocation worth billions that he took to Nyanza. “For us who voted for him, we were never rewarded for anything." Among the projects, he listed are the expansion of Kisumu International airport, Kisumu port and the renovation of the railway line to Kisumu. The UDA senatorial aspirant noted that Raila has been using the Western Region for his personal gain something he said should change in the August 9, polls.
