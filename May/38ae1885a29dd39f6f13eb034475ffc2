Former Inooro TV presenter Muthoni Mukiri is focusing on her mental health. In her latest YouTube video, Mukiri said social media threatened her mental health. "I have removed all my apps on my phone and put them on my laptop," she said. "So I only go to my laptop to reply to DMs, but on a normal 8-5pm, I am not accessing some of these sites." Muthoni said she deleted the apps as she wants to prioritise her joy and peace. She said makeup and other beauty standards had taken control of her life. She is also not angry when people stop being her friends. "I have stopped being angry. I am not going to disturb my peace, especially if you are not important in my life."
