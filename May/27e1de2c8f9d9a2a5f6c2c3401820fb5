This is your country, do not be at war with it, Azimio presidential running mate Martha Karua has told electoral officials. Speaking when she met the civil society and electoral officials on Friday, Karua said everyone should have a personal responsibility. "When you do things the way they are not supposed to be done, you are at war with your country. As an electoral officer if you help manipulate the electoral process you are at war with your country," she said. Karua said the officers should work towards bringing the country together and not dividing it. She gave a personal story of how she sued four individuals - three electoral officials and one party official - in the last election for trying to manipulate the system. "I have no personal war with the individuals but the message is that you can be dealt with as an individual and not necessarily an an institution," Karua said. She went ahead to give an example of United States election where a president aspirant called an official to demand a number of votes to be put aside for him, but the official declined because he knew the cost he would pay if it ever get revealed. "I think that is the same mentality our officials should have for us to move better forward as a country", she added. Last year, Karua faulted Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission for failing to involve key stakeholders, including political parties in ensuring a tamper-proof election set for August polls. Karua said it was unclear whether chairman Wafula Chebukati will rectify anomalies witnessed in the 2017 polls some of which led to the cancellation of the presidential election by the Supreme Court.
