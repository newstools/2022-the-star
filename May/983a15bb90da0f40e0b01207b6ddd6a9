West Ham’s European dream faded and died after the red mist descended during an acrimonious 1-0 defeat away to Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-back Aaron Cresswell was sent off in the first half to leave the Hammers facing an uphill battle. Manager David Moyes was also ordered from the touchline late on after angrily kicking a ball back towards a ball kid. Moyes was, however, full of praise for his side saying they still put up a fight with just ten men. He said many teams would have crumbled and ended up losing the game by a larger margin.
