World Under-20 3,000m steeplechase bronze medalist Faith Cherotich will be hoping for improvement during this year's edition scheduled for August in Cali, Colombia. Cherotich was placed second in the specialty during the Kip Keino Classic last weekend at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. Kenyan-born Kazakhstan Norah Tanui Jeruto won the race while Olympic Games 3,000m steeplechase champion, Uganda's Peruth Chemutai placed third. The Form 3 student said she was using the Kip Keino event as a build-up for the Colombia event. “I want to improve on my bronze to the gold medal and I am happy with the way I ran during the Kip Keino Classic,” she added. Cherotich said: “It was quite an experience, running top runners like Cheumtai and finishing ahead of them. I have learnt a lot and look forward to Cali,” she said. In the men’s 3,000m steeplechase, Africa Games champion Abraham Kibiwot won the title in 8:21.92 ahead of Ethiopian Samuel Dugina Bariso (8:27.40) and Benjamin Kigen (8:30.28).
