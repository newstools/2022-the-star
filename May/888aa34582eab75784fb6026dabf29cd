The Orange Democratic Movement party has said that playing boy-band Sauti Sol's music at Raila Odinga's event on Monday was a show of love, for their work. In a statement, the party said it appreciates Sauti Sol's music and the fact that the group has on many occasions carried the flag of Kenya high on international platforms. "We would like to assure our celebrated musical team Sauti Sol that we love them and appreciate their music so much," ODM tweeted. "The group has carried our country’s flag so high in international fora and every Kenyan appreciates this. Playing their song yesterday was a show of love for their work." The Orange party's statement came after the music group protested the use of their song 'Extravaganza' as a soundtrack at the Azimio la Umoja running mate launch at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre on Monday. "We did not like license this song to the Azimio la Umoja campaign neither did we give any consents for its use in the announcement of their Vice-Presidential candidate," Sauti Sol said. The group termed the move as copyright infringement contrary to section 35 CAP 170 of the Copyright Act of Kenya. They said it showed disregard for their basic and fundamental rights to property and freedom of association. "Our authority to use the composition, which is one of our most distinct composition was neither sought nor given." Sauti Sol expressed their disappointment with Azimio, and insisted that they remain apolitical.
