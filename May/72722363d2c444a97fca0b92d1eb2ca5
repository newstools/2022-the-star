The 2022 edition of the African Women’s Club Volleyball Championship, enters the round of 16 with eight matches lined up in Tunisia. KCB, who finished second in Pool ‘B’ face the Nigerian side Customs Service and will be hoping to redeem themselves after placing  9th place in 2019. The Japheth Munala’s charges are a blend of youth and experience and they are expected to put up a spirited fight this time around. “We knew we were coming here to face top sides in Africa. We have had enough time to prepare and we believe we stand a chance to reach the finals. We have a balanced squad and we are hoping the mix between the youngsters and the experienced will work for us,” Munala pointed out. Mercy Moim, the experienced outside hitter, was bullish in the assessment of KCB’s title chances. “Our ultimate desire is to go back home with the trophy and nothing else,” said Moim. She added: “We know the competition gets tougher as we get into the latter stages but we have to show the same desire as we have done in the preliminary stages.” The winner between KCB and Nigeria’s Customs Service will either face Kenya Prisons or VCL of Ivory Coast in the quarter-finals. Kenya Pipeline are hoping to revive their lost glory as they take on neighbours Ndenjje University of Uganda. Pipeline recorded two wins in their group but fell to record champions Al Ahly in their last match, losing 3-1 to the Arabs. Whichever team prevails here, faces either Cameroon’s FAP or National Alcohol of Ethiopia. Kenya Prisons have a date with VCL of Ivory Coast. The Wardresses have been faultless thus far, managing maximum points in the group. Other fixtures are —FAP (Cameroon) VS National Alcohol (Ethiopia), Al Ahly (Egypt) VS Asec Mimosa (Ivory Coast), Kelibia (Tunisia) VS Naval Spikers ( Nigeria), Carthage (Tunisia) VS El Wak Kings (Nigeria) and APR (Rwanda) VS RRA (Rwanda).
