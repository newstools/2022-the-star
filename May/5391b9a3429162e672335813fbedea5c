Mothers from Witu, Lamu West, have a reason to smile after the county government commissioned construction of a maternity facility at Maisha Masha dispensary. The facility will benefit hundreds of women from the area who have for years grappled with the lack of such a facility, a situation that has cost many mothers their lives and those of their babies during birth. The project is part of Lamu County Rural Health Centers Upgrade, which aims to ensure that pregnant mothers in the area receive adequate care. Speaking during the site handover at Maisha Masha dispensary, county executive for Health Ann Gathoni voiced concern about challenges women in Maisha Masha and its surrounding areas experience, including having to travel long distances to the Witu health centre while in labour. "It's concerning that pregnant women in labour are often forced to board boda bodas or walk long distances in the dead of the night, risking attacks by wild animals and criminals, to get to Witu health centre for specialist maternal health care,” Gathoni said. She said the challenges faced by mothers in these areas will now greatly reduce as the maternity facility will provide critical services within the community. The clinic will have a standard waiting bay for expectant mothers, a specialised delivery room, and monitoring and consultation offices for clinical services. Gathoni said the county government will also equip and deploy trained health caregivers in the facility to provide services to women seeking maternal healthcare. The maternity unit is slated to be completed before the end of this financial year and will serve residents of Maisha Masha, Lumshi, Amkeni, Jipendeni, Buffer Zone, Gatundu, Jericho, and Soroko, among other regions.
