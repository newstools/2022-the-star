AstraZeneca has signed a licence agreement with a small UK-based biotech company for a slate of COVID antibody therapies, the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant said on Tuesday. The experimental antibody therapies - developed by RK Bio, include those designed to target people with compromised immune systems - such as AstraZeneca's own antibody cocktail, Evusheld, which is already approved in multiple countries.
