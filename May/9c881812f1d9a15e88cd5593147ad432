Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka defended his decision to appear before the Azimio running mate selection panel, saying he did not want to give anyone excuse to exclude him from being Raila Odinga’s running mate. The former Vice President said it was his own decision to appear before the seven-member panel despite earlier dismissing the Committee chaired by former Kwanza MP Dr. Noah Wekesa. He described the exercise as more of a conversation and not an interview as it is being perceived. The Tuesday morning session lasted slightly over two hours. “I want to tell you that it was my decision to come because I realized we didn't want to give anybody an excuse whatsoever to say I refused to show up,” Kalonzo told journalists. “It was a useful conversation with the panelists led by Noah Wekesa.” “The Committee has great and experienced men like Bishop Njenga and Bishop Zacheus Okoth, I looked at that in my own right and said why would I not want to go and meet Bishop Okoth? I had to make that decision.” The former VP had over the recent days ruled out appearing before the committee, saying it is a public humiliation of a person of his caliber.
