YouTube has announced that it is changing the way video comments are displayed on the desktop. With the new teaser presentation video, YouTube said it will show a single comment below the clip. When expanded or clicked, the comments will open to the right of the playback window, just like how live comments are displayed, in a static motion. The goal of this view is to enable users to skim on comments as they watch the video. At the moment, the only upgrade on the mobile is viewers can sort comments, either Top or Newest, and only one comment is displayed. The new desktop format will begin rolling this week.
