For those with high blood pressure, it can help lower blood pressure. Though it is advised for those on blood pressure medication, it may be best to avoid coconut water as it could lower it too much. It’s best to discuss this with your doctor. It’s also recommended that you shouldn’t drink coconut water two weeks before any surgery as it can affect your blood pressure due to its high levels of potassium. For those who do not like sweet beverages, coconut water has a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. It is low in sugar and calories, as 94% of it is water. It is also cholesterol and fat-free. “There are many different types of stones,” says Smith. “But if your physician recommends you get more potassium into your diet, coconut water could be beneficial.” Enjoy coconut water any time of the day, with your favorite meal or on empty stomach. “If you enjoy the taste, it can be part of a healthy diet.”
