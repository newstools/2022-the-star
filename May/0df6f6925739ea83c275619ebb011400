AFC Leopards assistant coach Tom Juma says they will honour their Kenyan Premier League clash against Kariobangi Sharks at Nyayo Stadium even as it emerged that their opponents had threatened to boycott Sunday's encounter. In an exclusive interview on Friday, Juma said he only got wind of the development through social media reports and that they were yet to receive any official communication. “We are preparing for the match and it's upon our opponents to decide whether or not they'll turn out for the fixture. As far as we are concerned, the match is still on,” Juma said. Sharks had indicated they would not honour the match in a post updated on their official Facebook page on Friday. “We wish to announce to our fans and followers that we will not play our away game against AFC Leopards slated for May 14,” the statement read. “We will inform you if or when the league game resumes. We thank our fans and supporters for your continued support.” Head coach William Muluya refused to comment on the matter, saying the office was in a better position to clear the air. Sharks Chief Executive Officer Linda Ambiyo told Capital Sports their decision was informed by security concerns. “Football is planned way in advance. 48 hours to the match, no one has told us about anything in terms of security arrangements, officiating and plans for that match. This game is classed as a high-risk match and we can’t just go there without being informed of any arrangements,” Ambiyo said. “No one from the FKF Transition Committee has written to us in terms of match management and there has been no one to report to. Processes have to be followed in football." Ironically, Leopards were in Sharks' shoes last week when they raised similar concerns regarding the safety of Jomo Kenyatta International Stadium in Kisumu where they were to face off with record champions Gor Mahia.
