The court of appeal has set aside Sh27 million awarded to former Internal Security Minister Chris Murungaru for linking him to corruption in the Anglo leasing scandal. Justices Roselyn Nambuye, Patrick Kiage and Ole Kantai substituted it with Sh10 million. The High court had ordered former Anti-corruption czar John Githongo to may Murungaru the said amount for defaming him. Justice Joseph Sergon said it was clear Githongo had no evidence for the allegations touching on Murungaru in the multi billion shilling Anglo leasing scandal. Murungaru had accused Githongo of collaborating with the media to defame him through various publications. Yesterday, the appellate Court Agreed with Murungaru saying Githonogo did not demonstrate that he took any steps to establish the truthfulness of the defamatory remarks before penning them down and communicating them to other third parties. "We, therefore, find no error in the manner the trial judge analyzed the words, the content of the published matter was indeed defamatory to Murungaru."
