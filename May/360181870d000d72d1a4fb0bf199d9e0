President Uhuru Kenyatta on Tuesday commissioned the Mashujaa state of the art  Uhuru Gardens National Monument and Museum. The facility is set to act as an archive of Kenya’s history since 1800. The museum will include a Hall of Legends, which will showcase the lives of Kenya’s legendary ancestors including Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, Mekatilili wa Menza, Koitalel arap Samoei, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Nabongo Mumia among others. There will also be the Tunnel of Martyrs, as a memorial to Kenyans who lost their lives during the country’s darkest moments. Their names are placed on the sidewalls of the tunnel. The martyrs will range from the first to second World War all the way to the victims of the post-election violence of 2007-2008. In the Rope Gallery of the museum, a named rope will be dedicated to every one of the 1,090 heroic souls that were hanged during the colonial era. There will be a moment of Darkness Gallery, where Kenya’s lowest moments will be displayed. The Museum’s Hall of Innovation will celebrate the brilliant and game-changing ideas produced by Kenyans. This Hall is meant to speak about the coming future and how our past has guided it. The hallmarked by a spear pointing up, characterizes Kenya’s latest exploits, moments of great hope and national pride, and the bold path into the future.
