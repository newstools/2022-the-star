Deputy President William Ruto has unveiled Konyu ward MCA  Eric Mwangi Wamumbu as his preferred Mathira parliamentary seat candidate. The DP endorsed Wamumbu on Saturday during a rally in Karatina Town, Nyeri county. The DP said the MCA is able to fit the shoes of the incumbent MP Rigathi Gachagua. Gachagua is exiting the race following his appointment as Ruto's running mate. The DP said Wamumbu demonstrated his brevity by opposing the BBI and coercion meted on county legislators to pass the bill. "Kwa vile Gachagua anaenda Nairobi, tuko na kijana hapa ambaye anatosha kuchukua hiyo kazi. Huyu ni kijana shujaa. Ni baathi ya MCA wachache ambao walikataa pesa na wakasema hawawezi kubali BBI. Ni kijana mwenye msimamao na anajua kutetea watu wake," the DP said. Loosely translates to: "Now that Gachagua is heading to Nairobi, we have a young man here who fits the bill to take up the MP role. This young man is a hero. He is among the few MCAs who refused to be bribed and said they will not accept BBI. He is a man with principles and knows how to defend his people". The DP was speaking on the first tour of Nyeri county after picking Gachagua as his deputy. Wamumbu will be flying the United Democratic Alliance (UDA) party ticket for Mathira MP in the August 9 poll. He was the only aspirant who submitted an application to be considered for the UDA ticket. "We only received one application," the source who is not permitted to talk to the press told the Star. UDA had on Tuesday called for applications from aspirants intending to run for the seat setting Thursday, May 19, as the deadline. Ruto named Gachagua as his running mate on Saturday, May 15.
