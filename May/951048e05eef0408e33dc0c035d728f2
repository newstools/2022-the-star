Coastal side, Bandari ascended to third on the Kenyan Premier League log after beating Posta Rangers 2-0 at Thika Stadium on Saturday. Keegan Ndemi capitalized on a defensive lapse to punish the mailmen with a splendid strike in the 59th minute before Johanna Mwita pounced on another glaring opportunity to double the advantage in the 68th minute. The outcome leaves Bandari third in the standings with 50 points from 29 matches while Posta remain rooted in seventh with 42 points. The dockers have experienced a plain sailing run in their recent encounters  ever since Anthony Kimani took the reins from former head coach Casa Mbungo. Editing by Tony Mballa
