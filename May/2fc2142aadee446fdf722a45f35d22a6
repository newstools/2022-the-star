Kenyans will have to dig deeper into their pockets as fuel prices increase by Sh5.50 effective May 15. In a review by the Energy Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) on Saturday, Petrol will cost Sh150.12 in Nairobi, Diesel Sh131 while Kerosene will cost Sh118.94 per litre. Last month, fuel prices increased by Sh9.90 pushing the price of petrol to Sh144.62 in Nairobi. A litre of diesel in Nairobi retailed at Sh125.50 up from Sh115.60 in March. Kerosene retailed at Sh113.44 in Nairobi up from Sh103.54 in March. EPRA Director John Mutua said the new prices are inclusive of 8 per cent VAT in accordance the Finance Act, 2018, Tax Law amendment Act 2020 and adjustment of inflation rates. "The government will utilize the petroleum development levy to cushion customers from the unusually otherwise high prices," Mutua said.
