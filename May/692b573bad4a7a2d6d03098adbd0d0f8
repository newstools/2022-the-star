ODM leader Raila Odinga could be part of the crowd expected to throng Moi Stadium Kasarani on Sunday for the 94th edition of the country's most cherished football showpiece — the Mashemeji derby. In a post on his Facebook page late Saturday, the former prime minister admitted he was dying to watch the titanic battle between traditional Kenyan Premier League giants, Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards, his immense interest in international football notwithstanding. “You all know how much I enjoy international football. But nothing inspires my passion more than watching our talented young men and women as they battle it out here at home. We must support them! I look forward to tomorrow’s match,” Raila wrote on his Facebook page. The stadium might witness a return to full capacity after government's decision to ameliorate Covid-19 containment measures last month. The rivalry between the two clubs began at Nairobi City Stadium on May 5, 1968, with Gor Mahia squeezing out a hard-fought 1-0 win. Gor were banned from playing in Nairobi after crowd trouble marred their league encounter against Vihiga Bullets at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on February 13, where three fans suffered serious injuries. However, in an exclusive interview, Gor Mahia chairman Ambrose Rachier confirmed that they will be returning to the facility after a club meeting held on Wednesday afternoon resolved to shift the encounter from Kisumu to Nairobi following Leopards' security concerns. “We have arrived at a decision to stage the Mashemeji Derby at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on May 8 at 3 pm,” Rachier said.
