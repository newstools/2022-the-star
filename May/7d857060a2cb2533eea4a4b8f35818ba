China has officially withdrawn from hosting the 2023 Asian Football Confederation, Asia Cup. The four yearly event brings together 24 teams from the continent and was set to take place across 10 of China's major cities. This comes as the country tries to get a hold of its Covid outbreak but faces an uphill battle as the Government strives toward its strict 'zero-covid' policy. The AFC says it "acknowledges the exceptional circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to the relinquishment by China of its hosting rights."
