One person is likely to die from hunger every 48 seconds in drought-ravaged Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This is according to a new report by Oxfam and Save the Children, dubbed 'Dangerous Delay 2: The cost of inaction. The new report finds that despite an improved response to the crisis in 2017 when widespread famine was averted, the national and global responses have largely remained too slow and too limited. Already, 3.5 million Kenyans are suffering from extreme hunger. "What is happening in Kenya and the Horn of Africa as a whole is truly horrific," Save the Children country director for Kenya and Madagascar Yvonne Arunga said. "As of March, the number of children aged 6-59 months requiring treatment for acute malnutrition in Kenya had increased to 755,000, representing a 15.6 per cent increase from 653,000 in August 2021. "Arunga said Kenyan herders have been forced to trek long distances in search of water and pasture, increasing resource-based conflict and family separation, which in turn heightens the risk of gender-based violence.
