Plus-size designer and actress Neomi Nganga has condemned people who troll women because of their weight. In a recent post with her best friend Kate Actress, Neomi said people should understand that not all women add weight by eating a lot. She said people go through different things that could cause them to add weight abruptly. "There are perceptions about plus-size women. People think that you are overeating or you are doing nothing about your body," Neomi said. She said a friend told her her husband used to spray her with doom since he felt like she was smelling. Known for her good sense of fashion and style, Neomi Ng'ang'a serves as an inspiration to many plus-size women. In the conversation, Neomi added that one reason women add weight is due to fertility issues. "There are many reasons why women add weight. So stop body-shaming them," she said. "People need to know other people's background stories. There are women who are big because they are using a fertility drug since they cannot bear children." Neomi added that depression, marriage stresses and careers sometimes could cause one to add weight. "Before you call a person fat, please make sure you understand what they are going through. People need to know that our life is a journey and women evolve each and every time," she said.
