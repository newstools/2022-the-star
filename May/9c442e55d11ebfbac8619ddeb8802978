A hearse driver and his loader were arrested yesterday at dawn by police at Kabete area along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway transporting 130 litres of chang'aa. The 59-seater bus was heading to Nairobi from Western, where it had been hired for a funeral service. According to Dagoretti subcounty police commander Francis Wahome, the illicit brew was packed in polythene carrier bags and wrapped with clothes. Wahome said the clothes were stashed in between luggages and dry maize bags to conceal the illicit brew. The hearse attempted to dodge when the police ordered the driver to stop for a routine check, but the driver later obeyed and stopped. After a thorough search, the liquor was discovered and the vehicle was towed to Kabete police station. “We are investigating the incident to establish more on this business. We shall be inspecting hearse and other government vehicles and intensify the Rapid Response Initiative. They could be doing some illegal businesses," Wahome said. He said the two will be arraigned in court once investigations are complete. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
