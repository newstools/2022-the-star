The literary society has called on Kenyans to end book piracy, which discourages authors from writing more books. Authors, illustrators, publishers, booksellers and library managers lamented that pirated content and products have flooded the market with poor-quality books, resulting in the loss of employment for most professionals in the book publishing industry. The World Book and Copyright Day were marked in Nairobi with players renewing calls for an end to piracy to boost the growth of the books industry. Mercy Kibira, curator of the Moto Books and Arts Festival, said Kenyans should strive to embrace reading culture and enhance the impact of books and arts in the country. “This culture is aimed at boosting the impact of African literature in the society by encouraging children and young people to read for pleasure through its work with authors, illustrators, publishers, bookshops and libraries,” she said. She spoke during the Moto Books and Arts Festival. The initiative has seen several publishing houses, authors and the general public adopt 30 libraries across the country by donating books to bridge the literacy gap among school children, the youth and adults from the poor-resource areas. Maktabas CEO Gerald Mbugua said by participating in the initiative, marginalised communities will benefit by getting books to advance their literacy skills. “We are participating in the Moto Books and Arts Festival as a strategic partner to advance literacy levels in the marginalised areas by stocking libraries and fostering strategic partnerships that will grow our impact on communities,” he said.
