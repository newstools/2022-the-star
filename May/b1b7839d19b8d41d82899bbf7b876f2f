Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has been cleared by IEBC to defend his Bungoma seat. The senator was given a clean bill of health by Bungoma IEBC coordinator Grace Rono on Sunday. Critics have however lashed at Wetang'ula saying if he was sure Kenya Kwanza was going to win and he had been lined up to be the speaker of the National Assembly, why was he seeking to be re-elected. Wetang'ula however defended his bid saying the positions he was pushing for in the coalition will benefit Ford Kenya and the Luhya community. "I am not a selfish person, I am comfortable being your senator. I have served with humility. The positions we are pushing for are meant to benefit our people," he said. The Kenya Kwanza principal said of the 22 cabinet slots, Ford Kenya and ANC will have six slots. "This will apply even in distributing ambassadorial positions and heads of parastatals," he said. Wetang'ula said he is not looking for personal gain nor glory. He said Bungoma residents should vote for him and Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka as they have enough experience. "We are telling our people that we have been tried and tested and we have the interest of our people at heart," Wetang'ula said. The senator said the mulembe community should vote for the Kenya Kwanza coalition since Western leaders who are in Azimio have no stakes. He said Defence Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa had been left out in the first proposed cabinet of ODM leader Raila Odinga. "Let them tell us what is their stake on the other side before criticising our deal in Kenya Kwanza," Wetang'ula said. He said all key leaders including speakers of the two Houses are all in Kenya Kwanza, signifying the victory ahead. Lusaka who escorted Wetang'ula to the IEBC offices promised Azimio a bruising battle. "We will fight them in the air, sea and land." The speaker however urged Kenyans to have a peaceful election.
