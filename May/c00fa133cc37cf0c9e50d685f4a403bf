Strathmore Leos beat KCB 15-10 to win the Christie Sevens tournament on Sunday at the RFUEA ground. It was sweet revenge for the varsity side, who had lost 12-10 to the bankers during last week's Kababeri Sevens' final at the same venue. Louis  Kisia's side were quick off the blocks in an entertaining final and it came as no surprise when Philemon Olang powered his way over the whitewash to score the opening try for a 5-0 lead. Vice-captain Barnabas Owuor then pounced on a loose pass to score the Leos second try as they led 10-0. The bankers had hardly seen the ball in the opening minutes and from a quickly taken penalty, Geofrey Okwatch sliced open the students' defence to score at the corner and reduce the deficit 10-5. From the resultant kickoff, Strathmore recycled the ball and Matthew Mogaya crossed the whitewash to score the third try for a 15-5 lead at the interval. On resumption, Kenya Sevens star Levy Amunga dived over for an unconverted try but Strathmore held on in the closing stages despite the efforts of Dennis Mwanja's charges to score a winning try. Kisia was delighted with the victory, saying: We changed a few things in training, working on our restarts and defence as well play the game at pace. Credit to the boys.They have bounced back, shown character and delivered the title,” added Kisia. In the semifinals, KCB had to dig deep to beat Menengai Oilers 17-12 in sudden death while Strathmore thrashed Western Bulls 26-7. Menegai Oilers took the bronze medal after beating the tournament's surprise package, Western Bulls, 12-7. Mwamba finished fifth by edging Quins 26-5 while Homeboyz settled for the Challenge trophy after beating Daystar Falcons 26-14. The series takes a two-week break and will resume with the Driftwood Sevens on June 18-19 in Mombasa.
