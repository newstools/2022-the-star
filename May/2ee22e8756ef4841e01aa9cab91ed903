Rapper King Kaka says God visited him when he was bedridden last year. In an interview with Jalang'o TV, Kaka said when he was almost giving up on life, a bright light appeared and he was able to eat. "I saw a bright light in the room at night when I was in darkness and had not eaten for a week," he said. "The following day after seeing the light, I was able to take porridge and started feeling better. God visited me." "It is a blessing that I can now sit. I was not able to." King Kaka was in the hospital for about two months after he was misdiagnosed at a local hospital. This led to a tremendous weight loss.
