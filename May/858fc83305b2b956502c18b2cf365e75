Azimio la Umoja One Kenya coalition party running mate Martha Karua on Tuesday took campaigns to Laikipia County to woo Mt Kenya voters. Karua, who was accompanied by Agriculture CS Peter Munya, said their message to the electorate is on the importance of remaining united ahead of the August 9 polls. "Today, my brother Peter Munya and I set out to spread the Azimio la Umoja message in Laikipia County. Uniting Kenya is our utmost priority," Karua said in a tweet. The pair was scheduled to hold public rallies at Naibor and pull several other campaigns stops along the way as they head to Nanyuki Town. "The politics of today must be one of peace as we campaign, peace as we vote and peace even after the elections. Do not let yourselves become vessels of disunity," Karua said. Karua has touted her ticket with Raila as that of reformists, saying the difference between Azimio and their Kenya Kwanza rivals is evident based on their records. The Narc Kenya leader has expressed confidence that her series of campaigns in the larger Mt Kenya region is paying off. She hit the ground running in the hunt for votes in her Central Kenya backyard, a day after she was unveiled as Raila's deputy on May 16. The former Justice minister started with campaigns in Meru County and has to date held over 30 political rallies in Mt Kenya. Karua has been to Embu, Nyeri, Kiambu and Narok County where she was accompanied by Raila last weekend. The Azimio team faces stiff competition from their Kenya Kwanza opponents of DP William Ruto and Rigathi Gachagua in Central Kenya. With the latest opinion polls indicating that Ruto has a head-start in the vote-rich region with less than three months to the General Election, the region has become the epicentre of the succession contest. The rival outfits are engaged in a high stakes tussle as Azimio seeks to wrestle dominance from the DP who is largely perceived to enjoy an unparalleled following in the populous region.
