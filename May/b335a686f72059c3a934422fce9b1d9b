The highly anticipated encounter between record champions, Gor Mahia, and Kariobangi Sharks failed to live up to its billing after the sides played out to a drab barren draw at Thika Stadium on Sunday. Despite failing to guide his side to a crucial win that could have fired them to the third spot and possibly set them on course for a 20th title, K'Ogalo head coach Andreas Spier said he was gratified by the outcome. "We had expected a lot more from this match but I'm nonetheless satisfied with our performance on the pitch. We managed to maintain a high tempo in the closely contested encounter and that's good enough," Spier said. Sharks tactician William Muluya extolled custodian John Otieno for exhibiting a great character in the match. "The result reflected the strength of both teams and I think it was a fair outcome. I'm happy we worked hard not to concede and I wish to single out our goalkeeper for his solid performance,” Muluya said. Sunday's outcome leaves Gor fifth on the log with 46 points same as Nairobi City Stars who have a superior goal difference. Sharks are sixth with 45 points. Editing by Tony Mballa
