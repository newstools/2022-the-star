There's been a furious reaction in Israel after Russia's foreign minister said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler "had Jewish blood". Sergei Lavrov made the claim when trying to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Asked in an Italian TV interview how Russia could portray Ukraine as a Nazi country when Ukraine's own president is Jewish, Lavrov said that was irrelevant. "The fact does not negate the Nazi elements in Ukraine. I believe that Hitler also had Jewish blood," he said. His remarks play up an unproven historical claim that Hitler's paternal grandfather might have been Jewish. Under Hitler, Nazi Germany murdered six million Jews in the Holocaust. Israel's foreign minister called Lavrov's statement "unforgiveable and outrageous... as well as a terrible historical error", and he has demanded an apology.
