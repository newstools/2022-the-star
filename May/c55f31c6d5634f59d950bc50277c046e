Jurgen Klopp hailed his “Ferraris in the garage” after much-changed Liverpool took the Premier League title race to the final day of the season by coming from behind to beat Southampton 2-1. Reds boss Klopp opted to make nine changes at St Mary’s following Saturday’s gruelling FA Cup final win over Chelsea and was without a host of star names, including Sadio Mane and injured duo Virgil Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah. Klopp said he can ask for a lot and the boys will have to do it. It was a bit touching," Klopp said after the game. "Actually, I'm so happy about the performance.  It's like having Ferraris in the garage and then you let them out and they directly do like this," he added. The tactician admitted that it really is tough for his squad sometimes but their performance this year has been exceptional.
