A 14-year-old Standard 8 pupil is staring at a bleak future after her parents failed to secure the fee she needs to join Form 1 at State House Girls. Monica Atieno scored 408 marks in the KCPE exam. She needs up to Sh80,000 for first term and other facilities to join the prestigious school. Time is moving fast for the young girl, threatening her dream for a better life and that of her family. She told the Star the school asked her to join on May 13, but because the money available, her father, Joseph Koko, pleaded for more time. “So they allowed me up to the Friday of May 20 to raise the cash or I will mis the chance,” Koko said. "I am appealing for help. I can't raise this money and I risk missing this slot for my bright daughter. It is sad that I have to do this in her presence," Koko said. He further said the only options available for him is to take her to a local day school in Busia but this would be a huge disservice to her efforts. Monica is now pleading for help from well-wishers. The suggestion to join a day school, she said, would dash her dreams of being a space scientist. The young girl has had a fair share challenges. In 2020 at the height of the school shutdowns to contain the spread of Covid-19, she went missing in Nairobi. The father had just fetched her from school in Homa Bay and, while on a brief stop in Nairobi on their way to Mombasa where they lived then, they branched into a cyber cafe in the city. She, however, stepped out of the cafe and got lost, sending his father to frantically search for her. The Star highlighted her disappearance, triggering police action and leading to her being reunited with her father. Monica said she hoped to be offered a place at Alliance Girls, but is still excited to make do with State House Girls.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
