The naming of Deputy President William Ruto's running mate has seemingly hit a snag. Ruto was to name his deputy on Saturday morning but the unveiling was pushed to 1 pm, later 3 pm and eventually ended up not happening as at 6 pm. The DP was to pick either Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki or Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua as his deputy. Reliable sources told this writer that negotiations failed to bear fruits resulting in the exit of the two leaders from Ruto's official Karen residence. Kindiki was the first to leave at about 5 PM. 20 minutes later, Gachagua's vehicle was seen exiting the DP's official residence with sources saying the Mathira MP was on his way out. Other leaders allied to the DP were still in a meeting at the DP's residence by the time of going to the press. Sources indicate that Gachagua and Kindiki were subjected to a " nomination exercise"  whose results caused deeper divisions. For the better part of the day, journalists who had converged at the DP's residence were forced to pitch tents at the main entrance as they could not be allowed in. And as negotiations hot up at Ruto's Karen residence, supporters of Gachagua in Nyeri are now demanding the DP name Gachagua as his running mate. The seemingly agitated supporters read malice in the ongoing negotiations with some who spoke to the Star saying the seat had been reserved for Gachagua. A section said that they will not back Ruto's presidency in the event Gachagua is overlooked.
