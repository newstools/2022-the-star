Fortune Sacco have taken command of the National Super League standings after squeezing out a hard-fought 2-1 win over Kisumu All Stars at Moi Stadium, Kisumu on Monday. Jacob Kareno and Alvin Baraza scored a goal apiece to hand the visitors the historic away win –the first time in history they beat Kisumu All Stars in their own backyard. The Kirinyaga-based side are now level on points with APS Bomet at the summit of the table, albeit, with a healthier goal difference. Elsewhere, Zoo Kericho's hopes of making a return to the Kenyan Premier League suffered yet another setback following their shock 1-0 loss to debutants Mara Sugar. Reuben Mita's solitary effort was enough to secure his side the maximum points. Editing by Tony Mballa
