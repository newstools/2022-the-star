Five suspects are currently in custody, after being arrested transporting 1,500 kilograms of Sandalwood in Samburu. John Kanyi, Johakim Lobolia, Thomas Lokuwatuba, Kelly Lobolia and Francis Ekal Nadiko were arrested by detectives based in Baragoi on Friday. The five were found transporting the consignment along the Barsaloi-Masikita Road within Samburu North Sub-County. DCI director George Kinoti said the suspects were produced before a Court and detectives were allowed three days to hold them for further  probe. The government banned the harvesting and trade of sandalwood in 2007, following increased exploitation of the aromatic tree. The roots of the tree are used for the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics. “A burgeoning illegal trade has grown with the demand for this commodity increasing, leading to its listing in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red list of Threatened Species,” Kinoti said. Endangered East Africa’s sandalwood tree is being illegally harvested at an alarming rate that could see it become extinct. Experts made the revelation last year during a virtual meeting aimed at creating awareness on the illicit trade of sandalwood and its impact on the target communities. Kenya Forest Research Institute's forest products researcher Wycliffe Mauta said smuggling and trafficking of sandalwood are always rising due to the value and cost involved. The tree is highly valued for its essential oil that is used in the cosmetic industry. Sandalwood oil is commonly known for its woodsy, sweet smell and is frequently used as a base for products such as incense, perfumes, cosmetics, and aftershave. It is easily blended with other oils, making it desirable as a mix into other fragrances. In 2018, the East African sandalwood tree was listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. It is also listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.
