Poor access to information and safety are still the major challenges facing journalists in their line of duty, media workers in Kakamega have said. They highlighted this after their peaceful demonstration on the streets of town to mark the World Press Freedom Day on Tuesday. “Safety and security of journalists remain a thorny issue that ought to be addressed by both the national and county governments and other stakeholders with urgency,” they said in a statement. "Bureaucracy and sometimes lack of goodwill have made it hard for us to access critical information on health, agriculture, education, mining and environment sectors.” Their statement was read by journalist Cyrus Akhonya. They said access to information can help up the county and the country create opportunities and keep residents abreast of governments’ development agendas. They said both the county and national governments must recognise the key role played by the media through facilitating easy and fast access to information. “The county assembly through the speaker can help establish the county assembly journalists association to foster closer working ties and collaboration, like it is the case at the national level,” they said. They said county governments should have the right people with the requisite qualifications to manage and moderate social media conversation for the benefit of the larger society.
