Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka was a no-show at the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance rally in Kamukunji, on Sunday. The rally was attended by leaders allied to the coalition including various aspirants for various city positions from wards, up to top county leadership levels. His absence spoke loudly as the rally ended without a mention of the Wiper leader. Earlier on Sunday, Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi had shared photos of himself in a meeting with Kalonzo but did not reveal much about the meeting. Kalonzo is one of the leaders who interviewed to be Azimio presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga's running mates. The former Prime Minister was expected to name his running mate at the rally but said that he will name the person that will deputise him on Monday at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. With only hours remaining for political parties to name their presidential and deputy presidential candidates, all eyes are on Wiper Party leader. Some media reports have said that Kalonzo will vie for the country's top seat if he is not chosen as Raila's running mate. According to Standard Newspaper, allies of the Wiper leader are confident they have laid elaborate plans to have him run for the presidency in the August 9 General Elections. Reports indicate that Kalonzo has already collected the required 2,000 signatures from at least 24 counties.
