Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana has urged residents to maintain peace before, during and after election. He said politicians should also carry out peaceful campaigns, devoid of statements that might trigger clan animosity. The governor spoke on Monday while addressing residents of Madogo in Tana North. Godhana, who is seeking his second term on an ODM ticket, said all politicians must take the lead role and preach peace as they campaign. Past elections have been characterised by clan clashes leading to loss of lives and hundreds displaced. The county boss said Tana River has gone through several seasons both good and bad. “We have seen it all. We hope and pray violence never happens again,” he said. Godhana who used the forum to introduce his running mate Ali Loka said his team is campaigning on the slogan of peace and development adding that without peace no development can be achieved. “I am extremely happy and proud to present my running mate to the great people of Tana River. I chose him after careful consideration. He ticks all the boxes of the person I was looking for,” he said. The governor said the deputy governor position is full of daunting tasks. He said before settling for Loka, he assessed his capabilities to work as a team player and coming up with solutions to the challenges facing the county. Godhana however said residents should be on the look out for war mongers and inciters. He said such people who thrive on dividing the electorate and causing bloodshed, cannot be trusted with leadership positions. Loka, a teacher by profession said it is an honor to be chosen as Godhana's running mate. He said he will do all it takes to deliver the votes from his area. “I don’t take for granted the fact that the governor chose me out of other candidates. I promise to work closely with him and our entire campaign team, to deliver the seat and embark on transforming Tana River together,” Loka said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
