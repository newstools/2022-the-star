47 slot gambling machines have been set ablaze in Machakos County. The exercise was conducted by the Machakos sub-county security and intelligence committee alongside National Government Administration officers led by area deputy county commissioner David Rotich at his office compound on Thursday, May 26. “We have today destroyed 47 slot gambling machines confiscated by our officers from January this year to last week. These machines have adverse effects on our youth who also indulge in the game,” Rotich said. Rotich addressed reporters during the destruction exercise. “Youths have reportedly been stealing money from their parents so that they play the game,” he said. He said some of the joints where the machines had been confiscated were hideouts for criminals waiting for their targets, especially during late hours or at night. “It has been reported that trounce students or learners who sneak out of school visit gambling dens,” he said. Rotich said they had from their investigations established that the back of the machines was used to hide illicit drugs and substances like bhang. He said as a committee, they had resolved to eliminate slot gambling machines in the Machakos sub-county. “We have directed ward security committees to move with speed and confiscate any gambling machine for necessary actions. We appeal to members of the public to assist us by giving necessary information so that our teams can conduct operations,” Rotich said. Rotich assured the residents that as a government, they were ready to ensure that the sub-county was free from crime.
