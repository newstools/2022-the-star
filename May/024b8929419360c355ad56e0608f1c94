The entry of Helen Obado in the Migori woman representative race has piled pressure on two close family allies to drop their bids. Helen is the wife of Governor Obado. On Friday, she declared that she will be on the ballot on an independent ticket. Helen's declaration means that three of Obado close family allies Lillian Akugo(Jubilee Party) and Zilpa Audline (independent) will battle for the woman rep seat. “It is true I have an declared interest for the woman rep seat, this is a public seat where the people vote and I will seek their mandate,” Helen said. Akugo’s husband Dominic Akugo is the director of administration in Obado’s office while Audline husband Paul Owuor has been a key business partner of Obado’s and they both hail from Kanyamkago clan in Uriri. Akugo refuted claims that she has stepped down in favour of Helen. “It’s everyone’s constitutional right to go for any political seat. Lillian and Helen will never be on the same ballot,” Dominic said in a social media post on Friday. On Saturday, Akugo called a press conference in Migori town and insisted that she was still on the race after her husband social media post. “I am firmly in the race, there is no way I can step down for Helen who is barely three days old in the race yet I have campaigned for a while," Akugo said. "Forget about the social media posts, as a candidate my position is that I will be in the ballot.” Audline keep off from commenting on Helen's entry but she said she will be in the ballot after her appeal to the ODM tribunal over primaries loss to Dennitah Ghati was thrown out. Other who have declared interest for the seat include business woman Fatuma Mohammed and former Radio Journalist Josephine Sirega, both on an independent ticket. “We welcome the entry of Helen in the race but Migori's destiny will never be made my families. We are firmly convinced it is voters who will decide on August 9,” Sirega said. (Edited by Tabnacha O)
