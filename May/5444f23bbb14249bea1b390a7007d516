The Football Kenya Federation Transition Committee has ruled out Harambee Stars' participation at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers set to begin in early June. Transition Committee's head of secretariat Lindah Oguttu said it was outrageous for anyone to think Kenya would be allowed to embrace the international stage under the existing circumstances. “Surely, how would we play with the Fifa suspension still on. That's impossible so we are basically out of the qualifiers,” Oguttu said. Oguttu ruled out any chances of reviving the national teams for future engagements. “Allow us to resolve the impending issue with Fifa before we can think of doing anything else,” she said. Kenya brushed the world football governing body the wrong way after Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed expelled the Nick Mwendwa-led Football Kenya Federation and constituted a Caretaker Committee to run football in the country on November 11. The move immediately attracted Fifa's wrath with the Geneva-based organisation suspending the country indefinitely and setting conditions to be met before the sanction is lifted. Part of Fifa's demands is the reinstatement of the disbanded Football Kenya Federation. However, the government went ahead to hand the Caretaker Committee a new lease of life by giving them a new five-week mandate under 'Transition Committee'. It, therefore, means that Harambee Stars are out of AFCON qualifiers Group C fixture schedule, where they had been pooled alongside Cameroon, Namibia and Burundi. Stars were set to start their campaign away to Cameroon on June 4 and their opponents had actually named a squad for the encounter.
