Jubilee Party Nyeri branch now wants the Azimio Running Mate Selection Panel to consider Health CS Mutahi Kagwe to be Raila Odinga's running mate. The selection panel has until May 10 to close the exercise before handing over the preferred names to Raila and President Uhuru Kenyatta. In a statement seen by the Star dated May 5, Nyeri branch chairperson Philip Kahindi said that the CS has demonstrated leadership qualities in his current position. "We proudly endorse him for the position of running mate having demonstrated outstanding leadership and ability to galvanise support countrywide for Jubilee and larger Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition course," Kahindi said. This comes a day after the Jubilee Party National Election Board chairperson Stephen Wandeto presented the names of Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege and former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth to the panel. In a statement on Thursday, Wandeto said the party agreed for the two names to be presented to the panel. "We refer to the above subject matter and forward herewith names of the persons proposed by Jubilee Party for consideration as Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition Deputy President Nominees. Peter Kenneth and Sabina Chege," Wandeto said. Some of the big names mentioned as possible Raila running mates are Wiper boss Kalonzo, Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua, and Governors Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru) and Hassan Joho (Mombasa). Others are Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu, Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya, and James Mwangi of Equity Bank. On Thursday, Kanu Chairman Gideon Moi proposed Kalonzo as a suitable person to be named as Raila’s running mate.
