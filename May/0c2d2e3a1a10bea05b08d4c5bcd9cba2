Youngster Micheal Karamor came off the bench to clinch all the three points for Kakamega Homeboyz following a 2-1 win over KCB in a Kenyan Premier League match played at Bukhungu Stadium on Sunday. Buoyed by the partisan crowd, the hosts started the match on a high note with midfielder Moses Mudavadi, striker Yemi Mwana and winger David Okoth terrorising the visitors' defence. However, Gabriel Andika in the bankers' goal frustrated the trio with crucial saves early on. But it wasn't for long as Homeboyz' pressure bore fruits in the 15th minute after Mwana latched on to a long ball and chipped past the advancing Andika to send the crowd into wild celebrations. The visitors levelled matters in the 35th minute through Henry Onyango's free header, which easily beat Stephen Otieno between the Homeboyz' posts. The match looked evenly poised with both sides making changes and it was the home team that got all the three points to ease pressure on coach Bernard Mwalala. Mwalala attributed the hard-fought win to the support of home fans, adding that it had eased the pressure on him and lifted the spirits of his players. KCB Zedekiah Otieno blamed the defeat on fatigue, which prevented them from keeping the ball.
