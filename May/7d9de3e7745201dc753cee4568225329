Fish balls are rounded meatballs made from the fish paste which are then boiled or deep-fried. Fish balls are significant sources of vitamins and minerals. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Using a sufuria, simmer the fish fillets, 1/8 cup of water, salt, and white pepper. Step 2 After the fish softens up, remove from heat and place in a bowl. Mash it down to remove bones and form a fish paste then add in onion, garlic, parsley, seasoning, 1 egg, and 2 tablespoons of the flour Step 3 Mix all the ingredients together lightly then shape the mixture into balls and put them aside. If it gets sticky, wet your hands with water and continue forming the balls. Step 4 Beat the remaining egg in a bowl and then place flour and bread crumbs in two other bowls. Step 5 Heat the oil in a pan and place the balls once the oil is hot. Gently flip each side after 4 minutes until they are golden brown. Step 6 Once they are done, remove from heat and serve fish balls as they are or with any side of choice. I like serving mine with ugali or fries.
