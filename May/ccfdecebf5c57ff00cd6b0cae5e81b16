The son of a former dictator of the Philippines has taken an early lead in the country's presidential election. Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr has some 18 million votes against his rival's 8.5 million, an unofficial tally shows. If the landslide is confirmed as opinion polls had predicted, the Marcos clan, ousted by a people's revolt 36 years ago, would reclaim power. His main rival is Leni Robredo, a liberal who is currently the Philippines' vice-president. The process could take days before a winner is officially announced, as was the case in 2016. But pollsters in this campaign have consistently shown the Marcos heir ahead with a commanding 30-percentage-point lead. His running mate is Sara Duterte, daughter of the incumbent president, a hardliner who has come to the end of his six-year term in office.
