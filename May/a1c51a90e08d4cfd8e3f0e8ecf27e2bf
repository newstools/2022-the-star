The Duke of Sussex made a virtual appearance at the 5Rights Foundation's Global Child Online Safety Toolkit webinar to speak out about the harmful effects of social media on children. Harry clarified that his three-year-old son Archie and 11-month-old daughter Lilibet are too young for social media, but he is looking toward the future. "As parents, my wife (Meghan) and I are concerned about the next generation growing up in a world where they are treated as digital experiments for companies to make money and where things like hatred and harm are somehow normalised."
