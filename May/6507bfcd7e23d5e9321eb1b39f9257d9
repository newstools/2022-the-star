If you have a WhatsApp application in your phone, you know it goes for free. It does not support ads or paid services. However, all that might soon change as Meta has announced that it is preparing to launch a new subscription service called WhatsApp Premium. The application will not be for regular users as it will charge a yet unknown subscription fee. WABetaInfo says it is designed for businesses that would want to use WhatsApp to communicate with their customers. What is in the premium feature? Customizable links: Businesses will get to use customized click-to-chat links that they can post on their websites and share with customers. Link up to 10 devices: With the feature, subscribers will have the ability to link and name up to ten devices on the same account. The feature will be rolled out in the coming weeks globally but businesses will be able to continue to use WhatsApp Business even without paying but they have to give up some advanced features. Another feature that is already available in certain countries is the ability to send money via WhatsApp. Again, we expect this to be rolled out globally at some point. It is now clear that Meta wants to make more money using the platform, which is why it is introducing more features to make it attractive.
