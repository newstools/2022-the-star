TikTokers will soon have the ability to upload 10-minute-long videos. The official launch, as confirmed by TechCrunch comes as the entertainment application has been testing the change over the past several months. Originally, users could upload 15-second videos, before they extended to 60 seconds, then 3 minutes in July 2021. “We’re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience. Last year, we introduced longer videos, giving our community more time to create and be entertained on TikTok,” a spokesperson from TikTok said in a statement. “Today, we’re excited to start rolling out the ability to upload videos that are up to 10 minutes, which we hope would unleash even more creative possibilities for our creators around the world.” This means a user will not have to follow them for part 2 or more of their video series as everything will be packaged as one. TikTok says the option to film longer videos on the app will roll out to global users over the weeks ahead. I do not know if people will be patient enough to watch 10-minute long videos. But, whether you like it or not, brace yourself for new trends that form around longer clips.
