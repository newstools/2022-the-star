Wolverines striker Pauline Ochieng believes they have every chance of beating Sliders in Saturday’s Kenya Hockey Union women's Premier League match at the City Park Stadium. However, Ochieng observes that this can only happen if they play as a team. This is the only top-tier encounter lined up this weekend in both the men and women’s categories. The free-falling newbies are winless in four matches this season, having lost to Lakers, Strathmore Scorpions and Blazers — all by 1-0 margins. Their best so far has been a goalless draw against Amira Sailors. Wolverines are bottom of the standings in the seven-team league with two matches left to the conclusion of the first leg. “Irrespective of what happens, we badly need to get past Sliders to get our campaign back on track. We have performed dismally in previous matches and so there’s need to improve our game as well as work collectively to ensure we arrest the poor form,” added the former UoN attacker. “We cannot use the pandemic break as an excuse. We have to get our act together if we intend to maintain our top-flight status.” In the women’s Super League, Kenyatta University have a date with University of Nairobi ladies as Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology JKUAT entertain Vikings. In the men’s second tier, Kenya College of Accountancy University KCA-U tackle both JKUAT and Wazalendo Masters while Kisumu Youngsters face Parklands Sports Club. KU will settle scores with JKUAT and the Technical University of Kenya.
