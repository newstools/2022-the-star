At least 500 cyclists are expected to compete for top honours in the inaugural Eldoret Cycle 100 race this Sunday in Eldoret. Organizer Martin Keino said the bikers are expected to cover a distance of 100km across two counties of Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet. Addressing the media in Eldoret, Keino said proceeds from the event will go towards the conservation of Kaptagat Forest. "This is going to be one of the biggest cycling events not only in Eldoret but the entire North Rift Regional," he noted. Keino, who is the son of legendary athlete Kipchoge Keino and a former athlete himself, revealed that the bikers will start the 100km journey at Ilula in Uasin Gishu County. From here, they will go through Eldoret, Talget, Kichawa, Kaptarakwa in Elgeyo Marakwet, Nyaru, Kaptagat, and back to Ilula for the finish. “We are fortunate to have a few sponsors for the competition whose theme is ‘Conservation Of Kaptagat Forest'. " The beauty about this event is that the cyclists will cover the entire ecosystem of Kaptagat Forest. "They will ride the entire distance around the forest and will be able to see what they are supporting,” said Keino. Apart from the 100km, there will be 50km and 25km fun races for those who are unable to cover the entire distance. He said the competition will be divided into four categories namely— road bikes, mountain bikes, black mamba and the Under-20. “We have a prize package of Sh200,000 that will be spread across the four categories and this is just the first of many cycling circuits we hope to organize in Uasin Gishu County," he noted.  He said registration is ongoing online and the entry fee is Sh1,000. “So far, 253 riders have registered but our target is 500 riders.  For those who don't have bikes, we have our local company that will be hiring,” he said.
