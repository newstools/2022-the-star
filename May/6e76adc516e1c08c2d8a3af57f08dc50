Mathare United are on the cusp of relegation after failing to honour their third straight Kenyan Premier League assignment this season. The cash-strapped Slum Boys compounded their woes after snubbing their league fixture against Sofapaka at Moi Stadium, Kasarani on Friday. They had also previously skipped encounters against Bandari at Mbaraki and Ulinzi Stars at Kericho Green Stadium. Football Kenya Federation rules stipulate that a team could be subjected to relegation-bound automatically if it fails to honour three matches. According to the league’s rule 3.1.7, a club that skips a match is required to submit a letter giving a valid reason to the FKF Leagues and Competition. That should happen within 48-hours from the date of the match. In the event that such an explanation is deemed unsatisfactory, the defaulting club shall be fined by the committee and have their points and goals docked as a punitive measure. Accordingly, any club in a skips three fixtures in a season and fail to provide a solid explanation that seems untenable to the committee, will be suspended for the rest of the season, relegated to a lower league for the next season and may face other disciplinary action. In a letter written by club honcho Bob Munro, Mathare said their financial situation is the result of an escalating series of external factors over the last few years which kept eating into the revenue and/or raising the costs for all our top clubs.
