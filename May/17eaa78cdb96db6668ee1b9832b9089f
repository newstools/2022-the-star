If you have recently purchased a mid-tier gadget and you notice it has branded watermarks on all the photos you take using the camera. I never realized how big of a problem it is until I started viewing a number of pictures on Facebook with branded phone name watermarks. Here is how you can turn that feature off. The steps are identical in most android phones. Step 1 Open the camera app Step 2 Tap on the camera settings Step 3 Find the watermark switch and turn it off Note that the settings are either present as a cog icon on the camera viewfinder screen or behind a three-lines expandable. Once in, the watermark option’s location will vary for different phones, which I’ll highlight below for manufacturers I’ve tested. On cheaper Realme phones, you will find the watermark switch within the first 5 options in the camera settings, accessed directly from the camera app.
