Kisii clergy have urged parents to deter their youth from being exploited by politicians to cause violence. They said youths who are properly natured and taught how to be patriotic rarely engage in violence and extremism. “We must do everything to forestall hooliganism. This includes closing the gaps in parenting,” Kisii head of evangelical clergy, Rev Nyanuga Omambia said. He spoke Monday during the culmination of a seven-day peace drive by Kisii church leaders. The journey began last week from Marani in Kitutu Chache North, an area considered volatile before they set out for Bonchari, South Mugirango, Bomachoge Borabu and Bomachoge Chache. They concluded at Nyaribari Masaba and Nyaribari Chache. Nyanuga said they have instructed other clergy to talk to the faithful to shun war mongering aspirants. “We ask security agencies to scale up surveillance and ensure they arrest violence perpetrators and those who support it,” he said. At least 300 pastors participated in the event. Among those present were Pastor Evans Onduso (group vice chair)  Bishop Charles Isaboke and Elijah Ogoti. Isaboke asked the government to end the illegal liquor menace in the villages which he cited as a factor in the electoral violence. He appealed to the aspirants to be mindful of their language during campaigns. Some aspirants, he said, were using obscene language on their rivals threatening peace in the country. Onduso accused some of the youths of abusing drugs and taking illicit brews which disrupted functions. “We want the government to caution chiefs allowing the proliferation of illicit brews in their areas of jurisdiction,” he said.
