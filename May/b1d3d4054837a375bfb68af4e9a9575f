The national table tennis team has intensified preparations for Africa World Cup qualifiers starting today to May 28 in Lagos, Nigeria. Lagos was chosen by the African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF) as the host of the World Cup Continental qualification. Kenya teams are being handled by player-coach Kennedy Kojal and former Kenya number One Anthony Mathenge The men's team comprises Jensen Owade, Peter Their, Kevin Mwangi, Brian Mutua, and Josiah Wandera while the ladies' team has Bahati Rufina, Lisa Wele, Mary Kinuthia, Sejal Thakkar and Lydia Setey. The Lagos event will see the winners qualify to represent Africa at the World Cup. According to coach Mathenge, training is in top gear at the Nairobi Goan Institute. The team went through a strength and conditioning program this week courtesy of Trailblazers Sport's Performance at Goan. "We have been training at the Goan Institute over the past few months and we are hoping to make the trip this weekend. We are waiting for a word from our association, who have been in contact with the government. Morale is very high and we are looking to hearing from the authorities on the travel plans," Mathenge said. The Kenya team was scheduled to play in the ATTF Regional Championship in Addis earlier in the month but the trip failed to take off due to logistical challenges.
