Nyeri gubernatorial aspirant Gachara Kamanga has dropped out of the race, citing limited time to form a formidable campaign team. In a statement to newsrooms on Sunday, Kamanga said he joined the race late and had little time to create a campaign team. “After evaluating the status of my campaign and having joined the race five months ago. I find the remaining time to the general election too short to execute an aggressive grassroots mobilisation to win,” he said. “Therefore, I will not be offering myself. I wish to thank my family, my devoted supporters and the great people of Nyeri for their support.” Kamanga said he will now focus on campaigning for Azimio la Umoja presidential hopeful Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua. He also pledged to continue supporting the people of Nyeri. “I know my withdrawal is a great surprise and concern to those who believe in my vision," he said. "My development philosophies, policies and programmes are anchored on economic revolution, healthcare reform, youth employment and aggressive anti-corruption agenda “These four will remain my guiding pillars throughout my public life. Who knows? I might get the opportunity to advance these ideals in the next elections.” Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga of UDA will now face three other aspirants in his quest to defend his seat. They include Senator Ephraim Maina ( Jubilee), Thuo Mathenge (TND) and Peter Munyiri (CCK).  (Edited by Tabnacha O)
