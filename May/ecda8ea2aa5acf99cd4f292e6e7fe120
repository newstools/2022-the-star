Nandi South police chief John Owuoth said the suspect, Naftali Avendi, 59, was put in custody after confirming that his girlfriend, 30, had died and had buried her within the home. “His neighbours at Kamoron village suspected that something unusual could have happened after the woman went missing and on interrogation, the suspect admitted that she had died and buried privately,” Owuoth said. Avendi took the police to the burial site within Kamoron village, Kabwareng location-Nandi south. “We are moving to court today to seek orders to have the deceased’s body exhumed for an elaborate autopsy to be conducted to establish the actual course of her death.” The OCPD revealed.
