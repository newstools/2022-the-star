A 21-year-old Kiambu woman was on Saturday arrested after she was found in possession of 810 rolls of bhang. Police nabbed Rosemary Waithera Ngige with the narcotics after an intelligence-led operation led by officers from Kibichoi Police Station in Kiambu county. The raiding exercise of the suspected drug peddler's house happened at Thuita village in the Komothai location. The National Police service said the operations followed a tip-off by a concerned member of the public. " The culprit was arrested and a haul of 810 rolls of bhang recovered. She has since been placed in police custody as she awaits her day in court," it said. Indulgence in drugs and narcotics has caused anguish to families as most victims become less productive and dependent on their sustenance. The vice further exposes victims to health concerns related to contracting and the spread of communicable diseases. "We thank the public for their continued partnership in our valued community policing programmes through which this and many other significant exercises have succeeded," NPS said. NPS further expressed its commitment to ensuring that society is free from such drugs that has caused destruction to many people in the country.
