Roasted potatoes are perfect for a Sunday brunch with friends and family. Ingredients preparation Step one Peel and slice (or cube) potatoes then soak for 5-10 minutes in water. Drain well and pat. Step two Heat oil in a large pan on medium-high heat until it's shimmering and almost smoking. Add the potatoes and let fry for about 2 minutes or until they start to get golden on the bottom. Flip the potatoes then fry for a minute or two on the other side, or until the bottom layer begins to get golden. Step three Dump the pan of potatoes into a colander over the sink to remove excess oil and moisture. Blot with a paper towel and return them to the pan on medium heat. Step four Saute the onion and peppers plus any seasonings you would like on your potatoes with butter then add in the potatoes an salt. Step five Taste for seasoning and serve hot with plenty of pepper with lentils or nyama choma.
