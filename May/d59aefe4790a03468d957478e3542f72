The government will not extend the national examination registration period whose deadline is May 14, Education CS George Magoha has said. The national examinations are scheduled for November. Speaking on Saturday at Kakamega School, Magoha said headteachers and principals should ensure all candidates are registered before the deadline. The candidates will be sitting for the KCPE, Kenya Primary School Education Assessment for Grade 6 and the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education. Magoha said any of the school heads who will not abide by the directive will face his wrath. “When I look at the Knec portal, I get discouraged. Our headteachers and principals think that we will extend the registration deadline,” he said. Earlier he had visited Kakamega Primary school which has 560 candidates sitting for KCPE and another 1,000 candidates in Grade 6. Kapsabet Boys has 487 candidates sitting for KCSE exams this year and have registered their candidates. He lauded the two schools for the move. Magoha directed school principals to ensure all students are admitted regardless of whether they pay tuition fees or not. He said the government policy is to fast track 100 per cent transition from primary to secondary school. “We have 9,000 scholarships for such students. When a needy student comes, admit them and give them all the basic requirements and forward their name to us. We will then help them through scholarship,” he said. “Parents should also take their children to school whether they have school fees or not. The government will take care of them.” Magoha said he had received reports that some schools were turning away students over lunch money. He said anyone found capable will be punished “Day scholars should not be sent home to bring money for lunch. Just allow them in school but don’t give them lunch. Let the kids get an education to help their families, ”  Magoha said.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
