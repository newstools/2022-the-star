Jovial says she has been insulted after a video of her dancing with TV personality Rashid Abdalla went viral. The singer was serenading Abdalla at his recent 40th birthday with her hit song 'Mi Amor'. "The insults on the trending video of me at work. I'm just seeing women projecting their insecurities on an innocent act!" she wrote on Instagram. "The couple is my bosses, those who know the series know better! "Fix your homes and stop using me as an excuse! I'm an entertainer and I was doing my job! By the way, I was paid very good money." Lulu took to Instagram to thank Jovial for her good work. "You are destined for greatness. Apart from being your bosses, we are your number one fans. Keep on flying our flag high."
