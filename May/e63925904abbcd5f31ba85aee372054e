Harmonize's protege Ibraah has been accused by his alleged baby mama of not giving child support. Ibraah is signed under Harmonize's record label Konde Music. A woman by the name Clyna Sugar took to Instagram and Tiktok to demand that the singer takes his responsibility for their child. "He knows he's my father's child. His management knows and his uncle knows." Clyna said his uncle mediated for a while but then blocked communication, "so I couldn't go through him to get to Ibraah". She had to use her lawyer to get the singer's attention. "I don't know whether he's just being childish. I am one year older than him but he needs to understand he's now a father." Clyna said she is ready for a DNA test. Ibraah has maintained his silence on the issue.
