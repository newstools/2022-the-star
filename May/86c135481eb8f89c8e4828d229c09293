A section of indigenous church leaders on Friday endorsed Deputy President William Ruto for presidency. Under the auspices of the Federation of Evangelical and Indigenous Churches of Kenya (FEICCK), the 17 bishops also said Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru is the best bet to deputise the Deputy President. The church leaders were speaking on Friday in Nairobi. "We shall go to our churches and persuade our people to elect H.E William Ruto as the fifth President of the Republic of Kenya," said Bishop Samuel Njiri, chairman of the Federation. FEICCK said their decision is based on the DP's track record and his Christian faith. "As we all know, the IEBC has given Presidential candidates the May 16 deadline to submit names of their running mates. This is equally important to us. In this regard, we are making a passionate appeal to our Presidential candidate to nominate a women for running mate." The clergy included Bishops David Thagana, Isaac Mwangi, Benson Kiunjuri, Simon Okwayo, Mwenda Maluki, Herman Karogo, Dr. Jane Ngethe and David Musila. Others were Joseph Mathenge, David Maina Karuru, Hellen Muthoni, Steve Kibe, Paul Gachora, Anne Njeri, Jay Gachoka and Benard Hinga.
