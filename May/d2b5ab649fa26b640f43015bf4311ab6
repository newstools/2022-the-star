The event, also known as ‘Eagles Round’ will feature teams that finished in the top three overall positions during the Series’ qualifier legs held across 18 golf clubs in the country. They will tee off starting 06:30hrs. The golfers will compete in the tournament’s four-ball Stableford format where they will be seeking to make the cut for the Grand Finale on May 20 at Karen Country Club. Here, a fully-paid trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland will be up for grabs.
