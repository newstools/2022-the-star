Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has committed his future to Arsenal by signing a new deal and is looking to achieve success at the club. Arteta said he was "delighted" after it was announced on Friday that the Spaniard has signed a new three-year contract with the club. "I'm really excited about what we can do together,"Arteta said. The 40-year-old took over at the Emirates Stadium in December 2019 following the dismissal of Unai Emery. He won the FA Cup in his first season in charge, before a difficult second campaign saw them miss out on Europe for the first time in a quarter of a century.
