Most Kenyan men support Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga and his running mate Martha Karua compared to women. This is according to an opinion poll by Trends & Insights for Africa (Tifa), which was released Wednesday, May 18. In the poll conducted between May 16 and 17, 43 per cent of men prefer the Raila-Karua ticket and 35 per cent of women will vote for the pair if elections were held today. When Raila fronted Karua as his running mate expectations were rife that he will bag the women's votes but the poll shows otherwise. A similar outcome has been replicated where most men than women prefer William Ruto- Rigathi Gachagua. Ruto-Gachagua ticket is supported by 39 per cent of men and 32 per cent of women. However, the poll shows that 19 per cent of females and 9 per cent of males are undecided. With regard, to age, Raila Odinga is more popular than Ruto among older Kenyans with 43 per cent and Ruto with 35 per cent. More younger people than older people are yet to make up their minds with younger people at 17 per cent and older people at 11 per cent. 1,719 respondents were polled in the research conducted between May 15 and May 16, 2022. The poll had a margin of error +/- 2.34 per cent. The national survey was conducted across nine zones ; Central Rift, Coast, Lower Eastern, Mt Kenya, Nairobi, Northern, Nyanza, South Rift and Western.
