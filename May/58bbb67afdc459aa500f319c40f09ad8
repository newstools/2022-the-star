Innocent Simiyu has been sacked as Kenya Sevens head coach. His position will now be taken over by  Canadian Damian Magrath. Magrath takes over from the embattled Simiyu for the next two years and will lead the team to the Summer Olympics in Paris in 2024. Mcgrath will be assisted by Kevin Wambua who will offer seamless transitioning for the team ahead of the Toulouse and London Sevens tournament later this month. Also returning to the technical bench is strength and conditioning coach Geoffrey Kimani. McGrath faces a race against time ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July as well as the Rugby Sevens World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa. The long-serving coach has had stints as head coach of Samoa, Germany Canada and assistant England Sevens' coach. He led Samoa to win the Paris Sevens in 2016. Simiyu's technical bench of Anthony Muchiri and Mike Shamiah have also been offloaded. The former skipper has had inconsistent second spell with Shujaa and are currently languishing in 10th place on the log with 36 points. They also lost the Africa Sevens crown to Uganda last month. Simiyu guided Shujaa to their highest points tally of 104 points in 2018 in the World Sevens Series as well as led them to the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
