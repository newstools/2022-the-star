Chelsea “feel more like spectators” in dealing with players whose contracts are expiring, Thomas Tuchel has said. With Blues owner Roman Abramovich sanctioned by the UK government over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Chelsea cannot currently renew contracts. “You can end up in a situation where players talk with other clubs and get distracted,” Chelsea boss Tuchel said. “It’s easier if you are free to act and be involved in the talks. Right now we feel more like spectators.” Chelsea, who also cannot buy or sell players at present, appear set to lose defender Antonio Rudiger, to Real Madrid when his contact expires, while Barcelona have agreed a deal for Andreas Christensen and are also in talks with captain Cesar Azpilicueta. Abramovich put Chelsea up for sale before being sanctioned and the club have been operating under a special licence issued by the government. The club are on the verge of being taken over by a consortium led by Todd Boehly, co-owner of the LA Dodgers baseball team. Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs Arsenal and Everton will play a pre-season match in July at the home of the National Football League’s Baltimore Ravens, the teams announced on Tuesday. Billed as the Charm City Match, due to the city’s nickname, the July 16 game will kick off Arsenal’s three-match tour to the east coast of the United States with the other matches taking place in Florida later that month. Everton, who have made eight pre-season visits to the United States since 2004, will follow the Arsenal clash with a July 20 game in Minneapolis against Major League Soccer’s Minnesota United. The Arsenal-Everton match will be at the 70,000-capacity stadium that held its first football game in 2009 when Premier League side Chelsea faced Italian club AC Milan.
