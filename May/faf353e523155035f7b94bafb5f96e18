Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has decried 'mistreatment' of Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka during the funeral of former President Mwai Kibaki. Kibaki was buried in Othaya on Saturday, a week after he died in Nairobi. Last Friday, President Uhuru Kenyatta led the nation in honouring Kibaki with a state funeral at Nyayo Stadium in Nairobi. Kalonzo who served as Kibaki's vice president between 2008 and 2013 was not among the speakers at the events, despite attending both functions. Wambua feels the snub amounts to humiliation. "I take great exception to the mishandling of my party leader Kalonzo by state operatives during Kibaki's funeral service at Nyayo Stadium on Friday and the state burial in Othaya on Saturday," Wambua said in a statement on Sunday. He said it was not proper for Kalonzo not to be recognised during the services. "Try all you can, but you won't change history and you won't determine Kalonzo's destiny. We all know that Kalonzo was a loyal, able and effective vice president to Kibaki," Wambua said. The senator said there is no way the success story of the grand coalition government (2008 to 2013) could be adequately discussed, while turning a blind eye to the pivotal role and immense contribution by Kalonzo. "Denying him an opportunity to eulogise his boss will not change this fact. May Kibaki's soul rest in God's eternal glory," he said. Kitui Woman Representative Irene Kasalu also took to social media and said the unacceptable treatment will be revisited sooner than later. "We noticed how Kalonzo was treated during Kibaki's funeral. We shall revisit as the Kamba nation," she said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
