Klangemi Ladies coach Joseph Odhiambo believes their barren draw against an experienced Gaspo Women's team in the Kenya Women's Premier League match at Stima Club, Nairobi, on Saturday can boost their survival chances. Newbies Kangemi have registered three draws in their last four matches. They managed identical 1-1 draws with both Kayole Starlets and Kisumu All Starlets. Though they remain rooted at the bottom of the standings with six points, the tail-enders have closed the gap on 11th-placed Kayole to four points with six games to go. Kayole face an arduous task against Vihiga Queens at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. Odhiambo said the girls played according to instructions and their opponents were frustrated with their long balls strategy which disrupted Gaspo's rhythm. "We play Zetech Sparks next weekend and this result will no doubt inject belief into the players. We have nothing to lose and our fate lies with us. We feel no pressure at all and this could play to our advantage." "I believe we have what it takes to register our second win of the season against Sparks. We gave Gaspo no room to play their possession-based football and once you deny them the ball they become an ordinary team." Odhiambo said all players are available for the remainder of the season as previously contrary to earlier reports. "Schools have re-opened and that is a big boost for us. We can't afford to go down without a fight." Elsewhere, Trans-Nzoia Falcons silenced Bunyore Starlets 2-0 with Ruth Chebungei's double as Bunyore poor away form rages on. Jackline Chesang was the hero as Wadadia edged out Kisumu 1-0 at Moi Stadium, Kisumu. Editing by Tony Mballa
