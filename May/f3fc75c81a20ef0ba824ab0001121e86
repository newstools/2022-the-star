An operation is under way to move civilians from the Azovstal steelworks - the last part of the city of Mariupol controlled by Ukrainian forces. But street after street, building after building, most of the city now lies in ruins. Mariupol has seen some of fiercest fighting in this war. Thousands have died although exactly how many is still unclear. Bodies are said to remain in the streets. Others have been buried in mass graves, unceremoniously and unidentified. Russian forces moved in during the early days of the invasion, imposing what has been described as a medieval-like siege. Roads, electricity, communications and gas were cut off. Residents were forced underground amid constant bombardment and shelling. From the city’s pre-war population of 450,000, an estimated 100,000 remain there. The mayor, Vadym Boychenko, told the BBC that the situation was “very difficult” and that there were almost no food and water supplies left. Boychenko, who is no longer in the city, said about 20,000 people had been killed since the start of the invasion. With the phone network inoperative in most of the city, it is hard to independently verify information. “The citizens who left the city say that hell exists and it’s in Mariupol,” the mayor said. Mariupol is strategically significant for Russia. Capturing it would help Moscow create a land corridor between the pro-Russia separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and Crimea, which Russia invaded and annexed in 2014.
