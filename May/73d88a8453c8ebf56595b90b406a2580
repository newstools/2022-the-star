Avocado farmers in Embu have received certification to enable them earn a space in the global market. Some 32 farmers affiliated with the Kevote Avocado Farmers Co-operative in Embu received the Global Good Agricultural Practices certification on Monday. The farmers will join 300 others from Murang'a county, who were trained by One Acre Fund, on organically farming fruits that are in demand in the global market. The certification will connect farmers with global customers seeking the hass avocado at Sh100 a piece, evading the brokers who offer Sh5 or Sh10. Embu director of co-operatives Mugendi Ndwiga said he anticipates the number of certified farmers to rise to 200 by the end of this year. Ndwiga spoke during the certificate issuing ceremony at the Makengi police post. He said they are looking forward to establishing more partnerships to instigate avocado farming among the dominant cash crops such as coffee and tea. Ndwiga said Embu youths should venture into avocado farming as it requires minimum work and time. "When you plant avocado, you don't need plenty of time to nurture it. They can survive on their own," he said. Jacob Murithi, a farmer said the training will prevent wastage of fruits per season, as has been the case in the past. Daniel Omondi of One Acre Fund said the organisation anticipates an increase of avocado farmers to 1,500 households in the county. He said the certification will give the farmer's produce a wider market. "This certification will ensure farmers do not encounter losses because the market will be available," Omondi said. Paul Nyamuma One Acre fund field supervisor said the farmers are trained on all the Global G.A.P requirements of inspection, self-audit and external audit, and phytosanitary implementation. Mary Njue Kevote avocado farmers cooperative treasurer said as farmers they appreciate the new marketing plans with increased prices on delivery. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
