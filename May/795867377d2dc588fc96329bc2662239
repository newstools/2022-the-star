 EVANS OUSURU The national women’s hockey team will work out on different formations in their build up matches ahead of the Commonwealth Games slated for between July 28 and August 8 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The 30-member provisional squad hit residential training camp on Monday at Moi Stadium, Kasarani but train at the City Park Stadium as Kenya hope to upset the form book in their maiden appearance. The Blades are in Pool ‘B’, where they will open their campaign against defending champions New Zeeland on July 29. Captain Rhoda Kuira will then lead charge against 2014 winners Australia and Scotland before concluding the group matches with an all-African clash against South Africa. “We are currently working on adjusting into systems that will get us results since the kind of opposition we are going to face is not anything we are used to playing in Africa,” said coach Meshack Senge, who was in charge of the men’s team for a decade. He currently takes charge of both Strathmore University teams. He added: “I think our training is going on as per our plans and moving forward, we will test with different opposition for us to get even better.” Kenya managed a bronze medal at the Africa Cup of Nations that was held in Accra, Ghana, in January. Only 18 players will be selected for duty in the United Kingdom. Daystar University goalkeeper, Marylyne Wabomba, who hopes to make her debut at the Games said: “So far training has been good. We hope to bond more and gel well as a team. I would like to thank the Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee of Kenya for making the camp a reality.”
