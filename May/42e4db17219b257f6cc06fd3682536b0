Another breathless final day of a Premier League season led to Manchester City being crowned champions as Liverpool’s bid for an unprecedented quadruple was ended. City won the league title with 93 points, one ahead of Liverpool on the final day of the Premier League. It was City's fourth title in four seasons, and the second in a row. It seemed as though City would lose the title after falling behind 2–0 to Villa, but everything changed when İlkay Gündoğan scored in the 76th minute. Rodri equalized two minutes later before Gündoğan added his second minutes later to clinch the title. The result ended Liverpool’s quest for what would have been a historic quadruple, with the club already having won the League Cup and FA Cup titles. The Reds will play Real Madrid for the Champions League title in Paris on May 28.
