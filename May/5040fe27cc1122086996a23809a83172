Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga has picked Narc Kenya party leader Martha Karua as his running mate. Raila made the announcement on Mondy at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre. "At the age of 24, this woman was appointed a magistrate, years later she became the youngest woman MP, she led a team of lawyers to represent me when I was in detention, this woman is a fighter and not a quitter," Raila described Karua. The event was graced by party leaders allied to the Azimio-OKA coalition. Earlier media reports had placed Karua ahead of all the other candidates who wanted to deputise the former Prime Minister. Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential candidate Raila Odinga has named Narc-Kenya leader as his running mate at KICC, Nairobi. Karua had been selected among the top three candidates suitable for the job by the Azimio running mate selection panel after the two-day interviews last week. Who is Martha Karua? Karua’s profile in the country and Mt Kenya region has risen prominently since she vied for the presidency in 2013 and contested the Kirinyaga governor seat in 2017. She had announced her interest in making a second stab at the Kirinyaga governor seat under the Narc-Kenya ticket before being named Raila’s second in command. Karua once served as the Gichugu MP for more than 20 years, between 1991 and 2013. The ‘Iron Lady’ of Kenyan politics was born on September 22, 1957, in Kirinyaga and studied law at the University of Nairobi from 1977 to 1980. She later joined the Kenya School of Law in 1980-1981.
