At least seven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine - an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latest intelligence update, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. "Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience," the MoD says. "This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield." More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says "surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives". "Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy," he says. "To be captured for me means to be dead." "We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism," he adds.
