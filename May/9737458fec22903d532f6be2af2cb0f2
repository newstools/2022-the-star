The General Service Unit volleyball team have been boosted by the return of attacker Brian Melly, setter Abiud Chirchir and Simon Kipkorir ahead of the fifth leg of the men’s Kenya Volleyball Federation League starting tomorrow at Nyayo Stadium. Chirchir, 25, was attached to France’s Grand Nancy and was KVF’s Most Valuable Player in both 2018 and 2019. Melly had signed a three-month contract with Albanian side, Partizan Tirana at the end of January and was part of the history-making Kenya team that stunned Egypt 3-2 in the Africa Nations Championship in Rwanda last year while Kipkorir played for Arabian side Alibtisam. GSU are second with 15 points from five matches in the 16-team league. The defending champions face Nyanza Prisons tomorrow, and entertain Western Prisons on Friday before settling scores with Equity Bank Saturday. GSU will rekindle their rivalry with perennial rivals Kenya Prisons on Sunday. “We are delighted to have them back into the squad. There were moments this season when their services were badly missed. They are in better shape and we hope they’ll inspire the team to victory,” remarked GSU coach Gideon Tarus. After missing the recently concluded Africa men’s Volleyball Club Championship, Tarus wants his charges to play with fierce discipline, defensive courage, streetwise game management and a genuine threat on the attack. This, he said is the only arsenal they can deploy in a bid to defend the national title. “As much as we would have loved to be part of the Kenyan contingent to the continental show, there’s always next time. I am happy with the input of players in training. We must compensate the no-show at the club championship with the league title.”
