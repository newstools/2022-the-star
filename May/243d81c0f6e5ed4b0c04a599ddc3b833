Thomas Tuchel has hailed Chelsea’s likely third-place Premier League finish as a “miracle” given N’Golo Kante’s injury struggles. Marcos Alonso’s sweetly-struck volley snatched Chelsea a 1-1 draw with Leicester at Stamford Bridge that sealed third place in everything but mathematics. Tuchel said key players need to always be on the pitch, but Kante has only played 40 per cent of the time. "Then it's maybe a miracle that we arrive in third place because he is our Mo Salah, he is our Van Dijk, he is our (Kevin) de Bruyne, he is simply that player. He is our Neymar, he is our Kylian Mbappe, he is the guy who makes the differece," Tuchel said.
