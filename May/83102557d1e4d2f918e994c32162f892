Six suspected thugs raided M-Pesa shops in Majengo, Nairobi, and robbed the owners of Sh1.3 million. The owners were opening their businesses Thursday morning when they were attacked by the gang. Police and the victims said three shops were attacked in the incident. One of them said she lost Sh244,000, another Sh300,000 and a third one Sh800,000. Authorities said the three M-Pesa shops were adjacent to each other at Majengo Kwa Viatu, and that a fourth shop was broken into, but nothing was stolen, as there was no money in the storage box. The owner was not present. The gang seems to have mastered the movements of the victims and struck as they opened their businesses. The area is usually known to be a crime zone. A team of detectives that visited the scene minutes later was informed the gang escaped into the slum. “They knew police are not near here and hence took their time. But with time they will be caught, we know that,”a victim said. No injuries were recorded, police said, adding that an investigation into the robbery has commenced. Incidents of crime have been fluctuating in the city with police announcing more patrols to address the menace. Nairobi police boss James Mugera said they are looking for the gang that was behind the Majengo robbery. Elsewhere, two police officers were arrested for attempting to rob an Egyptian national of his money and cooking wares. The incident happened along Mombasa Road, Nairobi. The officers had detained the man and grabbed his Sh100,000 and the wares after accusing him of being in the country illegally. But after he called his employer who intervened, it emerged the officers wanted to rob him of the money and valuables. Investigations are ongoing before they are charged in court, police authorities said.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
