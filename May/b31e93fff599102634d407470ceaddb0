East Africa Breweries Limited’s  Josephine Katambo, said the tournament is a perfect opportunity for top golfers to take their game to the next level. "We are delighted to be holding our Grand Finale this Friday as a culmination of what has been a very successful golf series that kicked off last year.

She said many upcoming golfers from the country have received the chance to display their talents on a worldwide platform and are determined to take the same to an international level. "We, therefore, look forward to seeing top golf from all participating golfers as we crown the ultimate winner who will be heading to Gleneagles. This is part of our commitment as a brand to support the growth and development of the sport of golf in the country which has shown has great potential,” she said.
