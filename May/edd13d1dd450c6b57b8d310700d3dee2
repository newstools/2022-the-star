Singer Nadia Mukami has not been pressured by her baby daddy Arrow Bwoy to convert to Islam. Speaking during a visit to Wings of Compassion, Marurui on Mother’s Day Nadia said love is the religion. "He has never pressured me nor have I ever pressured him. Religion is a very sensitive topic for me. I do not like to talk about it as people can get the wrong impression." Last week, Arrow Bwoy was asked how they plan to handle their difference in faith but he deflected the question. She expressed her desire to see Arrow Bwoy convert but still added that there is no pressure between them and they are living a day at a time. Nadia Mukami and Arrow Bwoy are set to hold a wedding to seal their union.
