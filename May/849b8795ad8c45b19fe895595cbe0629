The office of the registrar of political parties has dismissed reports indicating it wrote to the IEBC instructing the body not to clear Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka for the presidency. The ORPP on Friday flagged the reports as fake. Speculations were rife that Kalonzo had reached a dead end in his bid for a second stab at the presidency. Misleading reports claimed the ORPP had directed IEBC not to clear Kalonzo on grounds that he was still a member of the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance. The Wiper leader or his party are yet to comment on the reports. Kalonzo on  Monday unveiled his running mate at the same time ODM leader Raila Odinga was naming Martha Karua as his deputy presidential candidate. The Wiper boss said he will seek the presidency in the August 9, polls. Details, however, indicate Kalonzo is yet to move to court to seek divorce from the Azimio coalition. Sources also say the Wiper party is yet to write to the ORPP seeking to exit the coalition. The agreement deposited at the ORPP indicates a member party of Azimio cannot exit the coalition six months before the election. Members are also required to stay in the coalition for three months after the election before contemplating an exit. This means member parties of Azimio can legally leave the outfit at the earliest, December this year.
