Motorists who will pay to use the Nairobi Expressway will not be allowed to take photos on the elevated road. Moja Expressway, the firm managing the expressway said in a tweet on Wednesday that this is for purposes of enhancing the safety of travelers. "Being an Expressway and for safety reasons, motorists will not be allowed to align or take photos on the road," Moja Expressway said. The firm also banned graffiti and posters on the Expressway and all of its auxiliary features saying this will be classified as vandalism. The firm confirmed that the Expressway is 99 per cent complete and internal testing by the maintenance and road safety department are underway. The firm said it has opened two service centers along Mombasa Road and on Gatanga road in Lavington to support the management of the road. The road is expected to reduce travel time in Nairobi and its environs especially for those who will use the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) service. Motorists can choose to use either the Manual Toll Collection (MTC) or the ETC once they reach the service centers. Other than the ban on photography, skaters, pedestrians, two and three-wheeled vehicles (tuk tuks), wheelbarrows and bicycles are also banned from using the 27 kilometer way. On April 17, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) urged motorists to make arrangements to access the highway ahead of its commissioning dates.
