US President Joe Biden has ordered the US flag to be flown at half-mast until sunset on Saturday 28 May following the mass shooting. In a statement, he ordered US flags across all public buildings and grounds, military posts and naval stations, and all naval vessels to be flown at half mast, as well as flags at embassies, consular offices and military and naval facilities in the US and abroad. At least 15 people are dead after a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, a town of around 16,000 people 83 miles west of San Antonio. Here's what we know so far.
