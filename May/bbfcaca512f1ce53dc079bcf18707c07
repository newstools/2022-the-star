Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha has finally released Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) results for Oriwa Boys High School. The school's results were withheld after Magoha noted that his Ministry had received reports of malpractices and the Kenya National Examinations Council (KNEC) had to investigate the matter further. Magoha released the KCSE results of 752,933 candidates on April 23. Speaking during the release of KCSE exam results, Magoha said they were still withholding the results of one school as there was a pending investigation. The Homa Bay County school with 549 candidates have posted a mean grade of 8.2 with 10 A-minuses. Out of the 549 candidates who sat for the exams, 521 attained a university admission grade of C+ (plus). Only twenty-eight (28) of the students did not attain the minimum university admission grade. Oriwo Boys High School principal, Maurice Ouma, noted that parents and students were impressed following the release of the results. Magoha, during the release had said that the results of some 441 students have been cancelled due to exam malpractice. The CS said the cases involved use of unauthorised material, 223 impersonations cases, causing a disturbance, and collusion during the exam period. "I wish to categorically state that KNEC will not have any mercy on examination offenders who must be dealt with decisively," he said. He said some 203  mobile phones that would have been used to relay pre-exposed examination materials were confiscated. Magoha further said that ahead of the 2021 KCSE, the Government heightened measures meant to pre-empt any forms of cheating through the combined efforts of all the members of the Multi-Agency Team.
