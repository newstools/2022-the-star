Kangemi Ladies have officially been relegated from the Kenya Women’s Premier League, after losing 5-0 to champions Vihiga Queens at Gems Cambridge in Nairobi on Saturday. Vihiga Queens' forward Topista Situma, who is on course for the Golden Boot, grabbed a brace for the county-sponsored side to take her season's tall to 16. Maureen Ater, Eve Chemtai and Faith Ongachi scored a goal each as the Legacy Makers made it 64 goals in 19 matches with three games left to end the season. Puren Alekwe (12) and Fasila Adhiambo's ( 11) face a tall order to catch up with Situma who has been a class act after being recalled to fill the void left by Tereza Engesha and Jentrix Shikangwa who sought greener pastures abroad. Vihiga have another record to pride in, having conceded only nine goals thus far. Kangemi Ladies will begin a new life in Division One next season after managing just one win and three draws from all their fixtures thus far. Bunyore Starlets (15) and Kayole's 16 points leaves the race for the final two relegation slots wide open. Elsewhere, Ulinzi Starlets romped past Kisumu, slaying the lakeside club 4-0 at Ruaraka grounds. A double from Sheryl Angachi and a goal apiece from Mercy Airo and Jentrix Kuyudi enabled the Super Cup champions to clinch their 10th win of the season. Ulinzi were tipped to fight for the WPL title at the start of the the 2021-22 season but eight draws dented their chances of a first title. In another match, Gaspo scalped Bunyore Starlets 2-1 at Stima club, Nairobi. Editing by Tony Mballa
