Posta Rangers head coach, Salim Ali, has urged his charges to be clinical enough in front of goal after they squandered a flurry of chances in their 2-1 defeat to Kenya Police at Kasarani Annex on Saturday. Ali said they lost a match they should have sealed in the first half with Clifton Miheso's brace canceling out Patrick Otieno's opener and handing the law enforcers the much-deserved win. "It is a match we ought to have won in the first half. We created numerous opportunities but failed to utilize them. That's now water under the bridge and we shift focus to our remaining matches," Ali said. Otieno fired the mailmen into the lead in the 35th minute after being teed up by Joshua Nyatini in the area. The coach Ali tutored side had several other opportunities coming their way, but Police custodian Job Ochieng put in a man-of-the-match performance, nibbing two close range attempts in the bud to ensure maximum points for his side. The hawk-eyed youngster was forced into two consecutive saves in a span of a minute, first stretching full length to block Timothy Wanyanga's attempt before throwing himself on the path of Jackson Dwang's rasping effort in the six-yard area. The mailmen must have rued squandering their chances, given moments later in the 68th minute Miheso gladly stepped up to level matters after David Cheche sent Alvin Mang'eni tumbling down in the box. Miheso then capitalized on a goalmouth melee in the dying minutes of the game to extend the law enforcers' advantage. Editing by Tony Mballa
