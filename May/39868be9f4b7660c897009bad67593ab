Socialite Risper Faith is planning to undergo a gastric bypass surgery to make her waist appear smaller. The mother of one shared a cute photo announcing the plans. "When I do my mini gastric bypass, it’s over for you bit***. Heels actually enhance your butt's appearance by lifting your cheeks and accentuating your feminine curves," she wrote. Gastric bypass surgery is a type of weight-loss surgery that involves creating a small pouch from the stomach and connecting the newly created pouch directly to the small intestine. In 2020, Risper underwent a liposuction surgery in a quest to eliminate extra fats from her body. Eight litres of fat was removed from her stomach and lower back. She has many times talked about her struggle with her weight loss journey.
