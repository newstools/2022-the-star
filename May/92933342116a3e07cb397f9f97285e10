Butali Warriors coach Joseph Osino wants the Kenya Hockey Union to conduct more refresher referees training in a bid to keep pace with the games' evolving rules. Osino questioned the integrity of the officials selected for duty in their scoreless draw against Western Jaguars on Saturday, where the defending champions dropped more points. The outcome enabled eternal rivals Kenya Police to close the gap to within a point of the sugar millers. The Constant Wakhura-captained Butali have 11 points from five matches. Police beat USIU-A Mashujaa 1-0 on Sunday to move to second with 10 points same as Strathmore Gladiators but the law enforcers have a superior goal difference. "Generally, we didn't convert our chances but officiating was pathetic, to be honest. We weren't happy as most decisions went against us. I don't want to use officials' bad decisions as an excuse but the truth is they need to up their game," Osino observed. "KHU must sensitise officials on the new rules and their conduct on the field. The game is advancing and officials need to be conversant with and not operate from a point of ignorance. As much as the players need to understand the intrigues of the game, it must start with officials." Mombasa Sports Club remain bottom of the 10-team league with zero points. Jaguars, who have managed one win are ninth with four points. Greensharks and Parkroad are sixth and seventh respectively after winning their weekend matches. Mashujaa occupy the eighth place. Two matches were played in the women's category as Lakers gathered four points after beating Wolverines 1-0 before a goalless draw with Sailors. Strathmore Scorpions remain top with 12 points. USIU-A Scorpions and Blazers are second and third respectively. Osano thinks teams within Nairobi need to play regularly to make the league more competitive. "A competitive league needs to be consistent. Teams within Nairobi should not go for two weeks without a match." Butali's take on Mashujaa neext on May 28.
