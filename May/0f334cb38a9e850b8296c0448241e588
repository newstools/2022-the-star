The Argentinian great described his opening goal in the quarter-final as "a little with the head of Maradona, and a little with the hand of God". He scored the controversial goal then dribbled past a host of England players to score again past goalkeeper Peter Shilton to knock England out of the tournament. That goal was later voted the ‘goal of the century’. The blue shirt, which has spent the last 20 years on loan at the National Football Museum in Manchester, went under the hammer at Sotheby’s on Wednesday afternoon.
