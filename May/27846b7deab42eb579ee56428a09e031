Usawa Kwa Wote party presidential aspirant Mwangi Wa Iria on Monday blocked the entrance to the Bomas of Kenya. Wa Iria who was accompanied by his supporters blocked the Bomas gates in protest after his name was omitted from the IEBC national presidential register. He said a person called Sunkuli, whom he claimed was an IEBC official, told him that his name was removed from the list because he only submitted signatures from nine counties yet he submitted from 24 counties. "My personal thinking is that when we bring signatures here some people are selling them because there is no way you can accept my documents, you don't give me feedback and then seven days later when I inquire, you send people to me informally," Wa Iria stated. He accused the commission of using unofficial channels to communicate with him and they have been avoiding him. There is a heavy police presence at the Bomas of Kenya as his supporters chanted "No Wa Iria, no election" slogans. On Sunday night, the Murang'a governor caused drama after he found his name missing from the register, yet he submitted all the initial requirements. “Even people who failed to meet requirements are in the schedule but my name has been removed… No election will be conducted if I will not contest,” he said. Wa Iria insisted that he met all the requirements, including bringing signatures from supporters in 24 counties as required and the commission even acknowledged receipt. “We cannot start rigging that far… They have deliberately removed my name today.” The Usawa Kwa Wote presidential aspirant called on all his supporters to accompany him to a meeting with the IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati on Monday.
