All roads lead to Nakuru as the 5th leg of the NCBA Golf Series resumes this Saturday at Par 73 Nakuru Golf Club. Over 100 golfers are set to tee off in a battle for a place in the Grand Finale and an all-expenses-paid trip to South Africa’s Fancourt Country Club. NCBA Group managing director, John Gachora, said the weekend promises to be action-packed. “We are delighted to be returning to the amazing Nakuru Golf Club for this event. Despite it being one of the most challenging golf course we have in the country, we had an amazing experience at the course during the last edition of the series with great golf talents being showcased," Gachora said. He expressed optimism that the competition will provide a platform for young talents to come through. "We, therefore, expect the same or an even better experience this time around. This is part of our commitment to supporting the growth of golf in the country by providing a platform for amateur and junior golfers to play and improve their competitive skills,” he said. The top five winners from the event will get automatic qualifications to the Grand Finale. These will include the competition's Division One (comprising Men golfers playing off handicaps 0-18 and Lady golfers playing off handicaps 0-22) winner; Division Two (comprising Men golfers playing off handicaps 19-36 and Lady golfers playing off handicaps 23-36) winner;  Division Three (comprising Men golfers playing off handicaps 37-54 and Lady golfers playing off handicaps 37-54) winner, Ladies' Category winner, and the Junior Category winner. So far, twelve senior golfers and two junior players from the previous three tournaments have booked their slots to play at the grand finale at the Muthaiga Golf Club in December this year.
