Chief Justice Martha Koome has announced that the Judicial Service Commission is ready to handle election disputes that may arise after the August polls. In a statement on Thursday, the CJ said the JSC was well equipped with an election Disputes Resolution(EDR) legal framework. She said that the EDR plays a fundamental role in the continual process of democratisation and catalyses the transition from the use of violence to the use of lawful and peaceful means to arrive at a just resolution of electoral disputes. The meeting comprised the African Union-COMESA- East African Community pre-election consultative mission to Kenya. Further, Koome said the mission will be working toward ensuring there is a credible and peaceful election in August. The mission was led by former Burundi President H.E Domitien Ndayizeye. “We have had a fruitful engagement with the Legislature on law reform arising from the lessons from the 2017 elections cycle. I am happy to note that we have secured an improved EDR legal framework through these reforms,” the CJ added. Koome lauded efforts made by the justice system in Kenya in ensuring that they have secured an improved EDR legal framework through the reforms that they have incorporated. “One of the legislative reforms that the Judiciary is happy about is the expansion of the composition of the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal (PPDT) to include 18 Adhoc members.” She also noted that out of a total of 167 pre-election cases filed at the Political Parties Disputes Tribunal, 124 cases were already concluded as of May 18.
