The WAP rapper tweeted from the beach, where she was on vacation with her husband Offset and their two children Kulture and Wave. Cardi captured a sinking yacht on camera, captioning the video: “I can’t believe I’m actually watching a yacht sink” In the footage, the boat can be seen becoming submerged in the water as Cardi narrates. “What the f**k! Oh my God. It’s sinking. Y’all see this? Y’all see this?! Oh my God, they can’t do that. Is there no big boat that can save it?”
