Mama Ida Odinga has urged Kenyans to vote for  Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Alliance Presidential candidate Raila Odinga to spur his rich legacy in Kenya's politics. In a statement on social media, Ida heaped praise on Raila saying he has sacrificed and delivered lots of goodies to the country. "For years, I've seen my husband work tirelessly for our Nation. I’ve seen how hard he's fought for democracy, defending the people. Each step of the way he's always had our back. This is the time to spur his legacy forward come August 9th," Ida said. Her appeal comes even as the ODM leader eyes the presidency for the fifth time in the forthcoming polls. He first vied for the presidency in the 1997 elections where he became third, with late former president Daniel Moi winning the polls. He vied again in 2007 and lost to late Former President Mwai Kibaki. In 2013 and 2017, Raila also vied but lost to President Uhuru Kenyatta. The former Prime Minister is facing stiff competition from the Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto. Raila enjoys the support of Uhuru who fell out with his deputy William Ruto.
