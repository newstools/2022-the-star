A court has allowed police to detain a woman, her sister and their friend for 14 days pending investigations into the murder of her husband. Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto ordered Sarah Rukia, Maximilla Moraa and Nasma Blume detained at Kabete police station. Police investigator Fred Ambasa told the court the suspects were arrested on May 7 following a murder case that occurred in Muthangari, within Nairobi county. The report was made at Muthangari police station where it was reported that the deceased was stabbed to death after a small argument with his wife. The detective told the court that the sister to the wife of the deceased reported that her in-law was stabbed and found lifeless on the floor. The court heard that the said woman (witness) rushed to the same house where she found the deceased bleeding on the left side of the chest and lying on the floor lifeless. “The police rushed to the scene and established that the three respondents were in the same house when the offence was committed,” the court heard. The officer told the court that he needed more time to complete the investigations to establish the main reason for the incident. “I need the autopsy report from the doctor to establish the cause of death. I need witnesses to record their statements and a mental test to be conducted too,” he told principal magistrate Kuto. The detective further told the court he needed 15 days to detain the respondent at the Kabete police station so that he completes his investigations. He said if the respondent is released, she is likely to tamper with witnesses and, at the same time, abscond from the court. Prosecutor Allan Mogere urged the court to uphold the detective’s requests for comprehensive investigations to be conducted.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
