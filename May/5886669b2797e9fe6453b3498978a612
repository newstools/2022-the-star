Kayole Starlets will miss the services of goalkeeper Sharon Miloya and striker Nancy Atako through injury as they take on Nakuru City Queens on Saturday. Despite the setback, coach Joshua Sakwa said they won't tinker with their attacking approach that has enabled the team to register two consecutive victories to move out of the relegation dogfight. Victories against Wadadia and Bunyore Starlets have injected belief into the side that had languished at the tail end of the standings for the better part of the season. Eliver Atieno will replace Miloya in goal while Sakwa hinted at playing two strikers upfront in an effort to claw their opponents. "We are gunning for maximum points as much as we know the harculean task awaiting us. We have four strikers but we will go with two to give us the chance to break Nakuru's stubborn defense," Sakwa said. In a major boost to the team, midfielder Quinter Awuor will make her much-awaited comeback. The maestro has been out for at least three months with a knee injury. " She's been struggling with a knee injury for the past three to four months but her return is timely. We have been disadvantaged at the heart of the midfield with her unavailability but I hope she will impose herself and guide the team to victory." Editing by Tony Mballa
