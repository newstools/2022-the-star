A Form Three student in Sosiot, Kericho County has murdered his classmate for turning down his sexual advances. The incident happened at Keben Secondary school on Wednesday morning. The Directorate Criminal Investigations, George Kinoti, said 19-year-old Tony Kiptoo stabbed Irene Chelagat, 22, with a kitchen knife. He said the knife went through the left side of her chest, killing her on the spot. Kinoti said the murder appeared predetermined. “Kiptoo, who was determined to end Chelagat’s life, had carried a kitchen knife from home to school and committed the horrific act just before the morning lessons began,” Kinoti said in a statement. He said the victim's photo was also found in Kiptoo's cubicle inscribed with the initials 'R.I.P.' Kinoti said the duo's classmates caused a commotion, prompting the teacher on duty, Kenneth Korir, to rush to the scene. “The teacher immediately rushed to the classroom and found the suspect being roughed up as other students were trying to assist the victim, who was bleeding profusely,” the DCI boss said. The victim was rushed to a nearby medical centre where she was pronounced dead on arrival. “Preliminary investigations by our detectives based in Belgut indicate that the two had been in a love relationship that had since ran its course and the lady had moved on,” Kinoti said. According to the deceased’s classmates, Kiptoo became furious after discovering that his ex girlfriend had found a new catch who had since bought her a new smartphone. The teacher described Chelagat as a diligent and hardworking student, who performed exceptionally in his English subject. "The murder suspect is currently in court as detectives seek custodial orders to allow them prepare a watertight case against him," Kinoti said.
