Deputy President William Ruto will submit his nomination papers for his presidential bid on June 4, his head of campaigns Governor Josephat Nanok has said. ODM leader Raila Odinga, on the other hand, has booked June 5 as the day he will be presenting his papers to the IEBC, according to his lawyer Paul Mwangi. The two revealed the details of the submission of the Presidential papers on Monday during the pre-nomination meeting held at the Bomas of Kenya on Monday. "We have planned to have our presidential candidate William Samoei Ruto present his papers on Saturday, June 4," Nanok said. Mwangi on his part said: "The 5th will present his papers to IEBC on the 5th of June". The clearance for presidential candidates has been set for between May 29 to June 6. 11 aspirants eyeing the presidency have, however, been locked out of the race after they failed to submit the names of their running mates by May 16, the deadline set by IEBC. IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati said the 11 are now struck out of the list of contenders for the top seat.
