In an interview on K24 TV on Friday, Siyad said the campaigns are quite expensive., and this locks out the majority of youthful aspirants. “It is very expensive to run for a governor seat in this country, as well as a Member of the National Assembly. It is cost prohibiting thus most of the youths cannot fathom the idea,” Siyad said. The aspirant said to campaign for an elective seat in Kenya, one is expected to have at least six to ten million shillings. “There is a lot of sycophancy and contractors who are the gatekeepers of our political process,” Siyad said. Further, he urged the youths to participate in the August polls to weed out non-performing leaders. “If you find someone who is youthful and has a youthful agenda and is running for MP, Senator or governor seat, support them because elections will necessitate changes in the country.” He added that the political-economical complex is intertwined. “If you are a young person out there, put your resources in the next 80 days to get a young person elected in August polls,” Siyad said. He also urged the youth aspirants to look back and change the community once they are elected.
