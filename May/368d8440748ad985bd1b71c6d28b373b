A prayer meeting for UDA nominees in Eldoret was turned into celebrations after DP William Ruto named MP Rigathi Gachagua as his running mate. The prayer meeting at the TAC centre was halted for live transmission of DP Ruto's speech after which there was song and dance. The UDA nominees and officials led by Uasin Gishu governor Jackson Mandago and senator for Kericho Harun Cheruiyot joined the crowd in song and dance. "We are happy that the DP had finally named his running mate and we will stand with Kenya Kwanza all the way to victory," Mandago said. The governor and Cheruiyot said they fully supported the decision by the DP which they termed as wise. Mandago said Rigathi deserved to deputize DP Ruto, noting that the Mathira MP had proved to be a committed member of the Kenya Kwanza team. "He has been steadfast and committed to the bottom-up economic policies and proved to be a national leader," Mandago said.
