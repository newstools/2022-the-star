Kenya Forest Service are keen to end the dominance of the General Service Unit, Kenya Prisons and Kenya Ports Authority in the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) men's league. "It is evident that the domineering period for the top three teams is almost coming to an end if the weekend results are anything to go by," said captain Michael Wafula. Defending champions GSU struggled to beat Equity Bank 3-2 in a five-set encounter while KFS upset favourites Kenya Prisons in straight sets as the fifth leg ended on Sunday. In another match, GSU tormented Prisons before taking a two-set lead.  However, the match was halted due to poor lighting at the Nyayo Stadium gymnasium. "We no longer fear the big three teams and it's no longer business as usual for them. The league is more entertaining because all the teams are competitive. This time, the likes of KFS, KDF, Trail Blazers as well as Equity are eager to upset the form book," Wafula added. KPA lead the standings with 28 points from 10 matches with GSU (23), KDF (21) and KFS (20) following in that order. Others are —Prisons Kenya (18), Trail Blazers (18), Equity (17), and Prisons Nairobi (16) among others. The top 14 teams have between five and seven games to go while  tail enders Vihiga and Central Prisons have 10 matches each to play. "Reception and blocking need to be worked on. They were costly in our loss to KDF and also in the 3-2 win against Administration Police," Wafula observes. KDF coach Elisha Aliwa echoed Wafula's sentiments as much as his charges face a must-win all their matches.  "The league is growing. No team is guaranteed a playoff slot and matches are becoming tougher." "It was nice to see giants being humbled. The trend is shifting and you can only underrate your opponents at your own peril. It is high time teams find a way of locking out KPA, GSU, and Prisons from the playoffs."
