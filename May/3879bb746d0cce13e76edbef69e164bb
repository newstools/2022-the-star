Top Kenya swimmers are limbering up for a major showdown at the National Swimming Championship slated for this weekend at Moi Stadium, Kasarani modern aquatic complex. Head of the Kenya Swimming Federation (KSF) Interim Management Committee,  Jen Maina, promised an action-packed event, saying participants would be drawn from all over the country. “The centre will see Kenya’s best swimmers gather from their bases in the country and abroad. Swimmers will be aiming to improve their times ahead of the XXII Commonwealth Games 2022 in England, the Africa Youth Games 2022 in Cairo, and the 2022 FINA World Swimming Championships in Hungary. Maina said the country would use the event to select a team for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. “We are hoping to take as many swimmers as we can because the bigger the team the better chances we have and the more the motivation. "But as of now, we have 15 swimmers who have attained 600 Fina Points. That is history, so we are looking to see more swimmers achieve the mark from this specific event,” she said. She said Kenyan swimmers are mentally prepared for the task ahead. Emily Muteti, who flew Kenya's flag at the Tokyo Olympic Games, and the 2019 Africa Games bronze medallist, Becky Kamau, will spearhead Kenya's onslaught at the games. Races lined up at the event include the 800m freestyle, 50m backstroke, 100m breaststroke, 50m butterfly, 200m freestyle, 400m, and 4X100m free relay.
