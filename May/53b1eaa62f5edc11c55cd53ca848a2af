President Uhuru Kenyatta has sent a message of comfort to the family, friends and constituents of Rabai following the death of MP William Kamoti Mwamkale. Mwamkale passed away Sunday night after he was involved in a grisly road accident. In his message of condolence, President Kenyatta described the second term parliamentarian as a top legal mind and devoted, progressive leader with an impressive development record. "Mheshimiwa Kamoti leaves behind a strong legacy of development and public service, especially in the area of education where he initiated several schools in his constituency," the President eulogised. "It is very unfortunate and painful that we've suddenly lost Mheshimiwa Kamoti, a progressive and astute leader that represented the people of Rabai Constituency in Parliament with great distinction." The Head of State wished Kamoti's family, friends, relatives and constituents God's grace and comfort as they come to terms with their leader's demise. "To the family of Mheshimiwa Kamoti, his friends, relatives and the people of Rabai Constituency, may God the Almighty comfort you all at this difficult period of mourning your kin and leader," he said. Kamoti, a trained lawyer, died just hours after being cleared by IEBC to contest for his Rabai parliamentary seat on an ODM ticket in the August 9 election.
