A freak accident involving eight vehicles along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway left one dead and over 15 people injured. The Monday morning accident near Kinungi occurred after a truck driver ferrying assorted items lost control and rammed into seven oncoming cars. Among the vehicles hit was a Nissan matatu leading to the death of a passenger. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru confirmed the incident. The injured were rushed to Naivasha subcounty hospital while police towed away the wreckages. "We had a grisly road accident along the highway where a lorry has hit seven other cars killing one and injuring over 15 people," he said on phone. James Kabono from Naivasha Road Safety Associations said lack of speed bumps along the section of the road had contributed to the accident. He termed the section as a black spot, adding that the victim who died was in the matatu that was destined for Nairobi from the opposite direction. "Speeding is a major problem here and this can be addressed through more bumps so that we can avoid such kinds of accidents," he said. Witness James Gitau said that a slight accident had occurred at around 5am involving two personal cars that had blocked a section of the road. He narrated how they tried to warn the lorry driver to slow down before he ended up ramming into the stationary cars and those that were driving uphill. “A passenger in the matatu was thrown out and crushed to death while scores of others were injured and rushed to Naivasha hospital,” he said. Rescuer Costa Gitau said they were awakened bya loud bang in the morning, forcing them to rush to the scene. "The accident involved several cars and those seriously injured were riding in the Nissan matatu that was heading to Nairobi from Nakuru," he said. (Edited by V. Graham)
