Africa junior 5,000m silver medalist Jacob Krop has said his next stop is the Monaco Diamond League on August 10 after clinching the men's 5,000m at the Kip Keino Classic. The Olympic Games 5,000m finalist timed 13:12.19 as Istanbul Half Marathon second-place finisher Daniel Mateiko (13:13.45 ) and national champion Daniel Simiu (13:14.51) finished second and third respectively. “For me, I want to run at the World Championships. Before that, I want to try my best to compete at the Monaco Diamond League so as to set the pace,” Krop said. Krop, who failed to retain his 5,000m title at last week's Adidas Adizero Road To Records, said he is also contemplating giving the Commonwealth Games a wide berth. “My focus is on the World championships and am thinking of avoiding the Commonwealth games,” the 2019 World Championships 5,000m finalist said. In the women's 5000m, Ethiopian Girmawit Gibrzihair won the race in 14:49.97, ahead of Kenyan-born Kazakhstani, former Africa Junior 2,000m steeplechase silver medalist Daisy Chepkemei (15:08.97) and World under 20 5,000m silver medalist Zenah Chemutai of Kenya (15:12.59) in second and third.
