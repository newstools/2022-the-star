Rugby clubs have welcomed the introduction of cash prizes for this year's National Sevens Circuit. Menengai Oilers coach Gibson Weru admitted that it has been long since they had sponsorship for the circuit. "Cash prizes have been scarce and the introduction of the same is a huge motivation factor, especially coming after the Covid-19 pandemic," added Weru. KCB sevens coach Dennis Mwanja said the level of play will be of a high standard for the remainder of the season. “Teams will put their best foot forward knowing there is something at stake at the end of the day and the players will be highly motivated to perform and make their teams proud,” he added. KRU have partnered with Betsafe to reward teams that perform well in the circuit. The betting company is putting in Sh5.9 million. Mwamba Rugby's honorary secretary, Humphrey Kayange said the partnership will help the clubs greatly. "When you find a  partner who shares our passion and values about rugby and the excitement that comes with it, It works well for the game. We can see a solid future together,” he said. Kenya Rugby Union (KRU) chairman, Oduor Gangla, hailed the partnership between the two firms.  "The tournaments held at various venues across the country amplify the key role the union makes towards marketing local sports tourism and providing a platform for players to express themselves while acting as a talent pool for th Kenya Sevens team,” added Gangla. The action continues this weekend with the Christie Sevens at the RFUEA ground. The circuit will then take a break to allow the Kenya Simbas to play their final two Currie Cup matches on home soil on June 4 and June 11 against the Eastern Province and Leopards. Driftwoods Sevens is slated for June 18-19 in Mombasa to be followed by the Dala Sevens on July 2-3 in Kisumu. The final two tournaments will be  Prinsloo Sevens in Nakuru (July 9-10) and Kakamega Sevens(July 16-17).
