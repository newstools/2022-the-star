It was an unusual morning for residents of Piai Village in Mwea, Kirinyaga county after they woke to the sad news of a man suspected to have killed his daughter before committing suicide. The 30-year-old man is said to have taken her three-year-old daughter for merrymaking at a local lodge where he is suspected to have poisoned her. After allegedly killing the daughter, the man is said to have imbibed several bottles of liquor which ended in him taking his life by hanging. His body was first to be discovered by the workers at the lodge. The daughter was thereafter found dead in the room. Area police boss Daniel Kitavi told the Star that preliminary investigations point to a small poison bottle that was discovered in the room and whose content might have been used in murdering the girl. Kitavi concealed the names of the victims as the family is yet to be informed about the incident. He said the police are yet to establish what might have prompted him to commit the act. The police boss revealed the man was still in an inebriated state when he committed the act. The man had separated with the girl's mother due to domestic-related challenges. He lived with his daughter in Wang'oru town. "Investigations are ongoing on what might have caused him to commit the heinous act," he said. The bodies have been taken to Kerugoya referral hospital awaiting postmortem
