The ruling Jubilee party on Friday chided Kenya Kwanza presidential candidate William Ruto for holding county economic forums across the country. The party in a statement blasted the Deputy President over the meetings saying it is ironic for a man who has been at the echelons of power to purport to plan about the economic needs of the country. The outfit further labelled the DP as "agendaless and a ghost worker" in the government he was elected to serve. This comes in the wake of accusations that the DP abdicated his duties and focus his energy on the 2022 succession politics. "It is confounding that a presidential candidate who has been campaigning for his August 2022 bid for five years whilst selling weird economic models is now holding town hall meetings to formulate his economic agenda and manifesto days to the election," Jubilee said in a Facebook post. The Jubilee attack came even as the DP staged a county economic forum in Embu on Friday where he listened to the grievances of area residents. On Thursday, the DP took his campaigns to Nakuru County where he met with the residents and regional Kenya Kwanza leaders in the town hall. The Alliance carried out a county economic forum where Ruto and his counterparts listened to the grievances of area residents. He promised 40,000 job opportunities to the youth if he wins the presidency. The UDA leader also directed members of the Kenya Kwanza Economic team to collect the people's ideas, suggestions and memorandums to make a charter to be signed between Nakuru Leaders and the coalition. Ruto has been preaching a people-centred manifesto through his bottom-up economic structure for years now if he becomes the fifth president of Kenya. He has also promised to set aside Sh50 billion for the micro-business owners to help finance them at a low rate of interest. Ruto is expected to stage another county economic forum on Saturday at Gakoigo Stadium, Murang'a County.
