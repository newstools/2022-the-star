Nyali  Club will host the 8th leg of the Safaricom Golf Tour this Saturday ahead of the Grand Finale. The 71 g0olf course tournament comes one week after the seventh leg of the tour held at Karen Country Club last week. The Karen event saw a 70-year-old Don Riaroh and nine-year-old Muriithi Gatu named the overall winners in the corporate and junior tournaments respectively. “As we embark on the second half of our inaugural golf tour, we remain optimistic about the impact it is having. We have reached close to 3,000 young people through the clinics, junior tournament and outreach programmes and we look forward to interacting with more young people from the Coast this weekend," said Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa. The weekend’s tournament also marks the first Safaricom Golf Tour leg to be held in the coastal region. The event has drawn a field of 220 senior golfers and over 50 juniors, from all the six counties in the coastal region. They include Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Tana River and Taita Taveta. The corporate tournament is scheduled for Saturday while the juniors will take to the course on Sunday alongside the golf clinic at the same facility. The Safaricom Tour has so far traversed seven locations across the country namely: Nanyuki, Limuru, Muthaiga, Nyanza, Machakos, Eldoret and Karen, drawing over 4,200 golfers. After the Nyali tournament, six more legs will take place before the series culminates in a Grand Finale at Vipingo Ridge, Kilifi County, in August. Safaricom has also partnered with Junior Golf Foundation to continue tapping and nurturing young talent in the sport. The juniors can register with Junior Golf Foundation (JGF) for Sh1,000 and have access to any golf club in the country.
