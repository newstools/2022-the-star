Azimio la Umoja presidential candidate Raila Odinga on Saturday led a host of leaders in mourning Mama Tabitha Nabwera, the wife to former minister Burudi Nabwera. In his message of comfort to the family and relatives of the Nabwera family, Raila remembered mama Tabitha as an exceptional healthcare worker whose service to the nation over the decades helped save lives of many Kenyans. “Mama Tabitha Nabwera has been one of the great Kenyan healthcare champions whose selfless service to mankind has saved the lives of many through her selfless contribution to save lives in all places she worked," he said. The former Prime minister said Mama Tabitha was a great matriarch who stood with her husband even as he served as ambassador outside this country. "I recall with nostalgia my late father’s  interactions with Mzee Nabwera when he had been posted to work as Kenya’s ambassador in the United States. My father helped mama Tabitha to get travel documents to join her husband to avoid mpango wa kando," he said amid laughter from mourners. He said it was through the efforts of the late Jaramogi that mama Tabitha secured a scholarship to study Nursing at the Manchester School of Nursing, and later joining her husband. Raila prayed for God's comfort the family of Mzee Burudi Nabwera and grant them divine fortitude to bear the loss of their departed matriarch.
