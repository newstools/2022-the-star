Police are hunting for the killer of a 65-year-old farmer in Kinangop, Nyandarua county. The attacker hacked the farmer using a panga along the Fly Over-Thika road near Kamae centre before fleeing with his motorcycle. Motorcycle operators from the centre held a peaceful demonstration demanding the arrest of the killer. Witness Jamleck Wanjohi said the lone attacker accosted the farmer along a lonely section of the road that is under construction. “The farmer was seriously injured on the head using a sharp object. He managed to describe the suspect before dying on his way to hospital,” he said on Monday. A senior police officer from Kinangop said no arrest has been made. “We are following some leads," the officer said. The body was taken to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Meanwhile, a week-long search for a missing flower farmworker ended after his body was found in his house at a Naivasha estate. It is suspected the man, who lived alone, took his life due to loss of job and strained relationship with his wife. A foul smell from the rental house attracted members of the public who in turn informed the police. The body was hanging from the ceiling. Naivasha OCPD Samuel Waweru said there was no suicide note left behind. He decried the rise in cases of suicide among youths in the area in the last couple of months, terming the trend as worrying. “We have lost another young man to suicide and this comes barely two weeks after a primary student took her life in unclear circumstances,” he said.
