If Kenyans want a real change, let them give the Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka the wheel and see how prosperous they will be. This is according to Winnie Kaburu Kinyua, a businesswoman and political activist. She said Kalonzo is a National leader who is respected worldwide and who has enough experience to be the future president of Kenya. "He is not just a Kamba kingpin but a National leader -who has followings inside and outside Kenya. Therefore he deserves respect and admiration," Kaburu said on Thursday. Kaburu ran as 2013 Presidential candidate James Ole Kiyapi's running mate. In 2017, she ran for Meru County governor on a Wiper party ticket. She added that the running mate position Kalonzo sought in Azimio is below his stature considering all his competitors. Kaburu pointed out that Kenyans should appreciate Kalonzo's humility and his faithfulness to the country. "They should be thankful to have such a selfless man in our midst instead of calling him all kinds of names," she added. Further, she said the former Vice President is a real leader in a country of  "realignments, tribalism and hero-worship". Her remarks come a day after Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu said  Kalonzo is a selfish leader and urged him to put the interest of the Kamba people ahead. The Wiper leader decamped Azimio after the running mate post was handed to Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua. Makueni MP Dan Maanzo said if Kalonzo does not change his mind and rejoin Azimio, he will only be running to give Kenyans a third choice. " He will garner a lot of votes not necessarily to spoil others' chances but for Kenyans to exercise their constitutional right to vote for a leader of their choice," Maanzo said on Tuesday. The Ukambani Kingpin is said to have 1.5 million votes from the region.
