Murang'a Woman Representative Sabina Chege has said that interviewing Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as a presidential running mate is not humiliating him. Sabina, an Azimio la Umoja One Kenya council member, defended the position to appoint an advisory panel to conduct the interviews. "Humility is a virtue, we saw DP Ruto going for an interview and answering questions for him to be confirmed as UDA presidential candidate. I don't think you can say that was a lack of respect," Chege said. Her remarks appeared to be a response to Deputy President William Ruto who on Wednesday said vetting the former vice president was a show of impunity on the side of the Azimio leadership. "We must unite to eliminate the culture of political deceit, the hallmark of some politicians. Whatever the circumstances every leader deserves some dignity and respect. Heshima si utumwa," Ruto said in a tweet. But speaking on NTV on Tuesday, Chege revealed that the Wiper party boss participated in the appointment of the advisory council mandated with conducting the interviews. However, Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo, who featured on the same talk show with Chege, stated that it was disrespectful to subject his party leader to vetting. Mutula said Raila's potential running mates should have been allowed to negotiate among themselves to settle on a suitable candidate. On Tuesday, Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance council secretary general, Junet Mohamed, explained the importance of the interviews. He said the vetting process was necessary for purposes of picking the most competent and suitable running mate to deputise Raila ahead of the August 9 polls.
