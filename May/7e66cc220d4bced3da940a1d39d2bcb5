In video footage obtained by TMZ, the former professional boxer is seen leaning over the back of his seat and punching the man in a "flurry of blows" while waiting on a Jet Blue flight scheduled to depart from San Francisco International Airport to Florida. A voice is overheard saying, "My boy just got beat up by Mike Tyson'' and that the passenger was, "Trying to ask for an autograph". Close-up footage of the man showed some blood on the side of his head and he apparently received medical attention shortly after.
