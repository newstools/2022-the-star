Former Kasarani MP John Njoroge, convicted of bribery,  is facing a fresh attempt to block his bid to recapture the seat he lost in 2017. A voter has sought an explanation from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission on his clearance to run. Kibe Mungai through Kihara Njuguna and Co advocates has written to the EACC asking whether Njoroge was cleared for public office. The former MP in May 2020 was sentenced to pay a fine of Sh650,000 or serve one year in jail after he was found guilty of soliciting a bribe. Njoroge had been charged with soliciting and receiving Sh100,000 from Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi on July 13, 2013. It was described as a bribe to facilitate payment of Sh3.3 million for completion of a Baba Dogo Secondary School tuition block. The accused told Nairobi Anti-Corruption magistrate Lawrence Mugambi that he is remorseful. The court said although the accused solicited and received the funds, he did not benefit from them since it was already recovered by the state and produced in court. Mugambi said the evidence on record proved the offence was committed. On these grounds, Kibe Mungai said Njoroge should not be cleared to run for public office again. "In view of the said conviction, our client is of the view that Njoroge is not fit to hold any public office, whether in Kenya or anywhere in the world," Mungai's lawyers said. He fears the former MP's name could be on the ballot in August after he was nominated by Deputy President William Ruto's UDA party. "The name has been forwarded by UDA to IEBC, which has subsequently listed him in the final list of candidates nominated by political parties. "As such, Njoroge is due for nomination by the IEBC on May 30," Mungai says in the letter to EACC chief executive Twalib Mbarak. If cleared to run, Njoroge will face incumbent Mercy Gakuya who defeated him in 2017. (Edited by V. Graham)
