Launched in November 2016 by Google, YouTube Go is reported to be discontinuing its application from August 2022. YouTube Go enables users to save videos for offline viewing and nearby sharing. First launched in India, the main purpose of the application was designed for viewers in locations where connectivity, data prices, and low-end devices prevented us from delivering the best experience in the main YouTube app. This move comes as LinkedIn lite also disconnected the lighter version of their LinkedIn app. “Specifically, we have improved performance for entry-level devices or those that watch YouTube on slower networks,” they said. YouTube also plans to build out additional user controls that help to decrease usage for viewers with limited data. YouTube recommends that YouTube Go users install the main YouTube app or visit the browser version of the platform. The company notes that the main YouTube app provides a better overall user experience in comparison to YouTube Go and that it has user-requested features that aren’t available on YouTube Go. Users will now get to have the ability to comment, post, create content and use dark themes.
