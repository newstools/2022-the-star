Kangemi Ladies are not ready to get rid of their top striker Fasila Adhiambo anytime soon, head coach Joseph Odhiambo has said. Odhiambo insists they will hold on to Kenya's Women Premier League's current top scorer even as they battle to avoid relegation. Adhiambo, alongside Zetech Sparks' Puren Alekwe, leads the Kenya Women's Premier League top scoring chart, having each found the back of the net 11 times thus far this season. Adhiambo's form has attracted a host of teams who will be queueing for her signature in the next transfer window. Despite minnows Kangemi remaining rooted at the foot of the WPL standings with just six points and as many matches left, Adhiambo has been key to their performance this season. The Form Four student at Dagoretti Mixed Secondary School in Kawangware, was the top scorer in the Cecafa under-17 tournament with seven goals. Her tally of 19 goals in the Division One league last year was also unmatched in the lower tier. "Adhiambo is the present and future of this young project we are building. She has single-handedly carried the team amidst the difficulties we have faced," Odhiambo stated bullishly. Adhiambo has scored two-thirds of Kangemi's 18 goals this season. "We hope she will still be with the team beyond December when she will be done with her examinations. If anything, I have nurtured her and I know her better but we'll see what happens." Topista Situma (Vihiga), Ulinzi's Siliya Rasoa and Stella Anyango who turns up for Thika Queens have managed 10 goals. Nabangala Nyongesa of Vihiga has nine and so does former Vihiga striker Tereza Engesha. Engesha signed a lucrative deal with Korea side Incheon Hyundai in March. Ulinzi duo of Lanoline Aoko and Mercy Airo have eight while the pair of Sherleen Onjote (Bunyore) and Carol Khaemba (Nakuru City Queens) boast of seven.
