Residents of Mirema Drive, off Thika Road, Nairobi, witnessed a shocking incident of a drive-through shooting in the neighbourhood that left a man dead in his car. The body of Moses Njoroge alias Berno was discovered in his car on Monday at about 4 pm moments after he had been shot six times in the chest. The incident happened in front of a young girl that the locals said is the deceased man’s daughter. According to eyewitness accounts, the unidentified man was dropping his daughter home from school when a white Toyota Premio car approached and blocked his car. The witness said a man wearing a suit stepped out and shot him four times. After the first round of shooting, the man went back to his car but came back and shot two more times. The suspect then drove away leaving behind the dead body as residents scampered for safety. The victim was also in the company of a lady believed to be the little girl’s mother. She had stepped out of the car and the engine was still running then when the shooting happened. Locals said the incident was an isolated incident in the area but decried rising incidents of insecurity along Thika Road. Kasarani police boss Peter Mwanzo confirmed that the unknown person alighted from his vehicle, shot his target six times and fled. “We don’t know the motive of the assailant but the matter is under probe,” he said. The body of the middle-aged victim was moved to the city morgue, pending an autopsy examination.
