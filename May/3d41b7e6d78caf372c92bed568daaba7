Champions Upper Hill are up against Alliance, Ofafa Jericho, Mangu and Nairobi School in Pool 'A' as the Prescott Cup tournament gets underway tomorrow. Pool 'B' will feature 2019 runners-up Dagoretti, Lenana, Rift Valley Academy, Muhuri Muchiri and Laiser Hill Academy. Upper Hill have been the dominant team in the competition for the past five seasons and will start as the favourites to retain the title. The top two teams in each pool qualify for the semis. The tournament returns after a two-year hiatus following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Prescott Cup will be used as a pathway to the Kenya Under-20 team popularly known as Chipu for future international assignments. Elsewhere, Koyonzo High School beat Kakamega School 12-3 in the final to lift the 2022 St Mary’s Yala 15's tournament held at St Mary’s Yala grounds over the weekend. Koyonzo landed two tries and converted one against Kakamega’s penalty after a barren first half. Unbeaten Koyonzo defeated St Peter’s Mumias 10-0 to reach the final, while Kakamega, the East African and National defending champions, edged Vihiga High School 7-6 in the semis. Koyonzo, who finished second in the 2019 Kakamega County Games after falling to Kakamega, will be keen to carry such a performance in the county competition in a bid to dethrone the holders. The teams are using the competition as a build-up for the county, western region and national events slated for this term following a two-year absence due to Covid -19.
