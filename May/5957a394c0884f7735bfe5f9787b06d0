She wants the former governor instructed to pay Sh86,000 fees, Sh30,450 school-related expenses and another Sh37,000 outstanding school fees balance pending the determination of the case. The woman says the refusal by Sonko to attend to the child's needs, yet he is a person of means, has caused the minor emotional stress and ridicule among her peers. "The unequal treatment has affected the minor psychologically as she does not understand why her father is abrasive towards her. Besides, the minor has been bullied and ridiculed in school because of her surname thus causing her emotional trauma and has indicated she wants to be transferred from the school,” she said in the court papers. She said they entered into a relationship in 1999 which culminated in a romantic affair. Court papers show the relationship was an on and off affair. The two got their child on April 17, 2007.
