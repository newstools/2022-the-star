Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told his players he wanted Spain to see his ‘mentality monsters’ in their Champions League semi-final second leg and was relieved they eventually made an appearance. The Reds boss’ intention was for his players to come out of the blocks and consolidate their 2-0 first-leg lead over Villarreal to ensure passage to a third final in five seasons. Kloop described the performance as outstanding and massive and one that feels like it's the first one. He praised Unai Emery's side for putting pressure on them saying the pressure is what makes the win so special for them. "But in the end we deserved it as well and that's really cool," Kloop said in his post-match interview.
