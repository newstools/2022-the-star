Press conference with Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta ahead of his side's final Premier League match of the season against Everton. Arsenal need to beat Frank Lampard's men and hope Tottenham lose to Norwich to sneak into the top four. Arsenal currently sit 5th on the log with 66 points, 24 points behind leaders Manchester City. Arteta said that is not where the club is supposed to be considering its previous record in the game. "This club's history tell us to be the best in this country and we are not there but we have to get there somehow." The Spaniard, however, said it will take time for the club to reach its pinnacle.
