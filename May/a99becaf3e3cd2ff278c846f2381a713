A Kanu politician from Wajir and another have been charged at a Kibera court for allegedly defrauding businesswoman Amina Abdinoor of goods worth Sh29, 092,325. Ismail Adan Abdul alias Farmajo was charged alongside Adan Ibrahim Bora before Kibera senior principal magistrate Esther Boke where they denied the charges. Abdul is seeking to be a member of the county assembly in Malka Gufu ward in Wajir on a Kanu ticket. The court heard that they committed the offence on diverse dates between January 7 and 13 in Industrial Area in Nairobi. They were charged with conspiring to commit a misdemeanour, namely obtaining goods by false pretence. The two were charged with another count of lying to the complainant that they were in a position to pay for the said goods contrary to the law. Businessman Abdinoor, through her lawyer, told the court not to release them on cash bail. The second accused person was a storekeeper where the said offence was committed. The two accused persons were in custody after a Kiambu court allowed the detectives to them pending investigations. The court heard that upon an investigation of their banks no amount of money had been identified. Boke, while giving her directive, released the accused person on Sh2 million or a cash bail of Sh600, 000. The accused person will appear in court on May 31 for a mention of their case.
