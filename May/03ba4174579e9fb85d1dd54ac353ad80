Detectives have launched a manhunt for the suspect behind the killing of a college student whose lifeless body was found close to Mburiria estate in Kiambu county on Saturday. The man, only identified as VDJ Flex, is the main suspect in the murder of the 19-year-old Purity Wangeci Kiringa. Purity and Flex are said to have been in a relationship. According to the DCI, Purity’s lifeless body had visible stab wounds and strangulation marks when it was found dumped by the roadside at around 6 am, by a passerby who immediately notified Kiambu based crime busters. Upon arrival at the scene, the detectives established that the 19-year-old had been killed elsewhere and her body dumped at the scene by her killers. "Bloodstained bedding, clothes and Purity’s identification documents were among the items recovered," DCI noted. Preliminary investigations by the detectives established that the deceased left college to visit her boyfriend who lives in Kirigiti, Kiambu county. According to her friends who were interviewed by the sleuths at the college, Purity and the boyfriend recently had a misunderstanding. Detectives from the elite Crime Research and Intelligence Bureau (CRIB) have been dispatched this evening on a mission to hunt down the suspect who has since gone into hiding. Meanwhile, the teenager’s body was moved to the City Mortuary, pending an autopsy to determine the actual cause of death and provide more clues on how she met her death. DCI urges anyone with information that may lead to the arrest of the suspect to reach out to them.
