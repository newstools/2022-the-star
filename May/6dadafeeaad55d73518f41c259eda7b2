Vihiga Queens' charge for the Kenya Women's Premier League title looks unstoppable following their 7-0 thrashing of minnows Kayole Starlets at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. Dynamic midfielder Merceline Oginga gave the Legacy Makers a 22nd-minute lead in the one-sided affair with Kayole offering little resistance. Experienced striker Topista Situma made a comeback on the scoresheet, giving the Cecafa club champions a haul (four goals) in a span of 18 minutes. She scored a hat trick within 11 minutes (in the 33rd, 36th and 44th minutes) to give the Boniface Nyamunyamu coached side a 4-0 half-time lead. The goal poacher completed her tally six minutes after the restart to make it 5-0. Vihiga made double substitution in the second half. Maurine Achieng and Janet Moraa paved way for Alice Ukiru and Dorcus Neema. Nabirye Joan was rested for Ayoyi Kebedi as Nyamunyamu opted for fresh legs. Eve Chemtai made it 6-0 in the 80th minute before completing her brace one minute from regulation time. "We were at our lethal best for the first time in the second leg. Free-flowing football was on display and the job was done by halftime," Nyamunyamu offered. Kayole coach Joshua Sakwa had said in past interview that they will try to avoid conceding many goals but that did not happen. Editing by Tony Mballa
