It's official! A takeover bid for Chelsea Football Club has been approved by the Premier League. American Todd Boehly's $5.33 billion deal has been given the go-ahead. The deal has finally been approved after months of negotiations after the government received legal guarantees that Roman Abramovich - who has had his UK assets frozen - will not benefit from the sale. The Russian-Israeli billionaire put the club he purchased in 2003 up for sale on March 2, a week after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24. "Late last night the UK Government reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea Football Club," a statement from government read.
