As we've been reporting, EU ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss how the bloc can reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels as a source of energy. According to one analysis, the EU has spent more than €47bn (£39.4bn) on Russian fossil fuels since the invasion began. You can see the live tracker from the Helsink-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Last month, the bloc's top diplomat pointed out that the €1bn (£840m) being sent every day to Russia in the form of energy payments was 35 times more than the sum the EU had actually donated to Ukraine to help it to defend itself. The EU is worried its dependence on Russian fossil fuels is inadvertently helping the Kremlin to fund the invasion of Ukraine, because a significant proportion of the payments are taken by the Russian government in tax. In fact, in 2021, the International Energy Agency estimated that revenue from oil and gas made up 45 per cent of Russia's federal budget.
