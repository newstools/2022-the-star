Rapper Khaligraph Jones has advised Gengetone artistes to plan their careers rather than blaming the industry. Speaking to Word Is on Saturday, the OG encouraged them to put discipline in their work so people can embrace their music. "I tell artistes to step back and re-strategise coz we all have problems, just that there are things I don't talk about," he said. "Sit down and come up with a new plan and stop blaming people for your problems. You will not make any progress. No one owes you anything in the industry." Khaligraph's response comes a few days after former Sailors Gang's Qoco Juma said Kenyans underrated their music genre. "People have been saying Gengetone music is dead. What I can say is that the people saying that are the same people fighting against our success," he said. Khaligraph also said the reason he did his dedication song to his mum was that he can handle the negativity. "If I did 'Maombi ya Mama' song before I became rich, Kenyans would have trolled me," he said. "I am now successful and at a point where I can handle the trolls and the hate. My story is relatable to many people and the problems I experienced back in the days and now becoming successful."
