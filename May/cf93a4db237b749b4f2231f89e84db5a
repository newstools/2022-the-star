Chief Justice Martha Koome has urged parents to guide their teenage children so they can grow into responsible citizens. She said teenagers require a lot of attention. “Parents should not abscond their roles of instilling good manners in their children. They should be the first ones not their teachers. The teachers should shape what the parents have already instilled,” Koome said. “We need a healthy and responsible society in the near future. Our children are growing and we need them to advise their children too.” Koome spoke on Sunday at Loreto Limuru Girls High School during a prize giving day. She was the chief guest. The CJ was with her deputy Philomena Mwilu and judges Mumbi Ngugi and Luka Kimaru. Justice Mwilu urged parents to create time to listen and reason with their children. She urged them to ask questions regarding their children's lives to understand and help them. Parent Timothy Mwangi raised concerns that a lot of teenagers get into bad companies, hence they are misled. Mwangi applauded the institution’s principal Eunice Njenga for inviting judges to address and advise students. Justice Ngugi urged the government to ensure children with disabilities are considered during Form 1 selection for national schools. She said this will prevent locking out students with potential and talent. “We are abled differently. The Form 1 selection should address the issues regarding people with disabilities. We might lock out people who will help this country in the future. I'm one of those who were given a chance to acquire education and now I’m a judge” she said.
