Tanzanian singer Nandy would never hide a pregnancy. She said being pregnant is every woman's dream. "Being pregnant is a good thing for any woman. It's something that any woman wants," she said. "And I have been in public so how could I be hiding a pregnancy. So if I am, you will see it. It's a blessing to get pregnant. It's not a small thing and if God sees it fit to bless me then so be it." Away from the pregnancy rumours, Nandy talked about her forthcoming marriage to fiance Bill Nas. "It's not a secret I am getting married to him," she said. "You have seen the traditional rites we have gone through, including dowry payment. And God willing, we will tie the knot in a few days to come."
