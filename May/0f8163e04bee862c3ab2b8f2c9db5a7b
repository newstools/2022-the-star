The Service Party leader Mwangi Kiunjuri has asked Kenya Kwanza principals to remain neutral and let aspirants under the coalition face off without their help. Kiunjuri said it beats logic for coalition principals to campaign for candidates allied to their parties yet the alliance is approaching the August polls as a united front. “When you are in a coalition, you need to work as a team. You cannot pretend in the day that you are in a coalition and at night, you are not in a coalition,” Kiunjuri said. “I cannot go to Nyandarua today and ask the people of Nyandarua to support a TSP candidate when we have ANC, Ford Kenya, Tujibebe and CCK candidates. I would be a hypocrite.” Kiunjuri spoke on Tuesday during a press conference. In an apparent reference to Deputy President William Ruto, the TSP boss said internal competition should be left to aspirants to convince the electorate to elect them on the strength of their parties' ideologies. “If you are at a certain level in a party, you should be aware that what you say now represent the coalition. “Because if you are privileged, the only good thing to do is to ensure that you don’t fight your juniors,” Kiunjuri said. Twelve political parties are under Kenya Kwanza, including the coalition's founding parties, the United Democratic Alliance (UDA), Ford Kenya and Amani National Congress, ANC. Others are Chama Cha Kazi (CCK), Communist Party of Kenya (CPK), Devolution Party of Kenya (DPK) and Farmers Party. The Economic Freedom Party (EFP), The Service Party (TSP), Umoja Maendeleo Party and Tujibebe Wakenya Party are also under the fold. The coalition has settled on DP Ruto as its presidential candidate in the August 9 polls.
