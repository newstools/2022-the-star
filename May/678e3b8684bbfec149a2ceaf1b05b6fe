DCI officers in Kirinyaga Central have launched investigations into a suspected suicide case of a man who was facing land-related forgery charges. The body of Peter Maina Kamau was found dangling from a rope in his Gathuthuma village house on the outskirts of Kagumo township on Sunday. The body, investigation head Peter Ochieng said, did not have physical injuries. Preliminary investigations, he said, revealed Kamau may have died by suicide after he allegedly slipped into depression due to a criminal case he was charged with earlier in the month. Ochieng said on Wednesday that the 59-year-old was out on bond after denying land-related forgery charges in a Kerugoya court. This was not the first time Kamau was arraigned over land forgery charges. Ochieng said Kamau had seven other land-related charges ongoing in Mwea, Thika and Embu. “Before his arraignment in the Kerugoya law court, the suspect was arrested in Nairobi by investigators. He was a wanted man for the alleged serious land fraud crimes,” he said. Ochieng said Kamau's relatives are yet to present themselves to his office or at any police station in regard to the death. He said the department has opened an inquest file. Statements from several witnesses have been recorded. The body was taken to Kerugoya Referral Hospital mortuary. Edited by A.N
