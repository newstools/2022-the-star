The government of Kiambu has proposed an additional six municipalities due to rise in population and need for services. Governor James Nyoro said the municipalities will help the county lobby for more funds for development. He spoke at Nyambare trading centre in Lari constituency, last week, where he commissioned a 1km road funded by the World Bank. He said the government relied on census report of 2009 when the municipalities were created. Unlike other counties, Kiambu benefitted with Limuru, Kikuyu, Kiambu, Thika, Ruiru and Karuri municipalities. The municipalities come with new markets, tarmacking of roads, drainages and street lights. The governor applauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for creating municipalities to benefit from the World Bank programmes. Nyoro said they have already tabled an appeal to Uhuru, requesting him to add them the six municipalities. According to the proposal, each constituency will be a municipality. Currently, a municipality serves two constituencies. Traders chairman Paul Ngugi said the road will make it easier to access the market. Project manager Michael Ndung'u said the tarmacking of the road and construction near the Kimende market will cost Sh48 million. "These are two projects that were funded together and are running concurrently," Ndung'u said. Residents praised the governor for partnering with donors to improve their towns. Ngugi said the town's hygiene will also improve once the modern drainages are completed. "Traders need a clean place to do business to attract customers who can easily leave id not impressed," Ngugi said. The governor also inspected the ongoing construction of Kimende market.
