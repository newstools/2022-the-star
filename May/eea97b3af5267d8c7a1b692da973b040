Kenyans have been urged to maintain peace as the August election nears. National Cohesion and Integration Commission chairman Samuel Kobia appealed to Kenyans to keep peace during the electioneering period. He said Kenyans need to be more tolerant of each other's views to maintain peace and move away from the culture of election violence. Kobia spoke at the second Conference on Peace, Security and Social Enterprise held at the Mwai Kibaki Convention Centre at Mount Kenya University Thika campus. The conference was held between May 18 and 20. MKU held the inaugural peace conference in 2017 in the run-up to the general elections. The theme of this year’s conference was, “The role of universities, public and private sectors in peace building for socioeconomic development”. Fisheries, Aquaculture and Blue Economy PS Francis Owino said Kenyans have a duty to ensure there is peace. “This important discourse could not have come at a better time in our country. The role of individual citizens in peace building is critical. Similarly, institutions, both public and private are major formal employers and partners in community social and economic development. They play significant roles in peace building.” The university said the conference offers a platform for Kenyans to engage in different ways to build and sustain peace. “The 16th SDG champions a society that is free of violence of all kinds, promotes the rule of law, ensuring equal access to justice and shared resources,” MKU vice chancellor Prof Deogratius Jaganyi said. "This is therefore a good justification for this conference and many other activities that we as Kenyans and the world at large are doing to advance peace at all levels." The conference is a culmination of activities the university has organised over the last few months that include stakeholder workshops and peace runs. MKU was designated as hub for reduced inequalities under the United Nations Academic Impact. Edited by A.N
