Senior counsel Tom Ojienda has said that it is not possible for Amani National  Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi to garner 70 per cent of votes from the Western region. Speaking at Citizen TV on Thursday, Ojienda said the Kenya Kwanza Western leaders will not get as many votes from the region because the majority of the residents were supporting ODM leader Raila Odinga's bid. "I do not think Musalia and the Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula can garner the 70 per cent votes from the Western region. Western Kenya is the bedroom of Baba (Raila)." Ojienda noted that most ODM supporters come from the area. "Remember that is where we have the Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya." Oparanya was appointed the Western campaign chairperson on Wednesday after a meeting by the coalition. He said this just a day after the details of the Kenya Kwanza Alliance power-sharing document were revealed. It included an agreement schedule that requires Mudavadi and Wetang'ula to deliver at least 70 per cent of the Western votes to the alliance on August 9. The five counties targeted are Kakamega, Bungoma, Vihiga, Busia and Trans Nzoia, which have a vote count of 2,592,437. "Those conditions almost count for nothing. The thresh hold setting cannot be achieved," the lawyer said. Ojienda said Maendeleo Chap Chap leader Alfred Mutua also has unattainable ambitions in bringing in 35 per cent votes from Ukambani. Ojienda expressed confidence in the Ukambani votes, "especially if we get Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka as a running mate."
