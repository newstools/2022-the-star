Industrious Tusker FC midfielder Rodgers Ouma says he has regained his confidence after finding the back of the net against Talanta in their Kenyan Premier League clash at Ruaraka Grounds last Sunday. Ouma's goal was all that the brewers needed to surmount a tough opposition mounted by the hard-battling newbies. While admitting that his confidence had experienced a dip after he failed to make the starting lineup in two consecutive league matches, Ouma said he took the chance placed at his feet by coach Robert Matano to prove his mettle. “I didn’t play in the last two matches and when I was given a chance, I took it. I took the opportunity to redeem myself and now I have to work harder to remain in the starting team,” Ouma told the club's portal. “I had gone down a bit but now I have come up and I thank God that I topped it up with the goal,” he added. So inspired was he by the goal that he took time to reminisce about his moment of glory. “My anticipation was high. I got the ball, controlled and I was facing the target. I didn’t wait and I went for the shot. It is a motivating goal for me and more so, I am happy it got the team maximum points.” The youngster who linked up with the brewers in September 2021 from the defunct Western Stima, reckons the goal will inspire him to a greater performance in the remaining phase of the season. “It has really motivated me. If given another chance, I will go in with the same spirit and I will be better. I have to keep it up and not go low again. We keep moving as a team and working towards our goal,” he added.
