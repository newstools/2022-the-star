Robert Masila, who scored 401 marks in KCPE at Kimana’s Ramatisho School in Kajiado county, is unable to join Form One due to a lack of fees. Masila (Index No.31545313014) sat for his KCPE and scored “A” in English, Kiswahili and Mathematics, while in Science and Social Studies and Religion he scored “A-”. His single mother, Selina Naliaka, is employed as a fishmonger in Kimana town. She cannot raise any substantial amount from her earnings to even buy food for her children. “We were promised by Equity Bank through their Elimu program that they would come to assess our situation, but they have never come,” said Naliaka. She said her son has never slept ever since he received an invitation to join Form One at Machakos School on April 16. Masila’s mother said she is employed to sell fish in the small town of Kimana near Loitokitok border town with Tanzania and sometimes can go for days without selling a piece of the dried fish. Naliaka blamed the Covid-19 situation in the country for killing her grocery business in the town and the high cost of living. “My son is a prayerful child. He prays day and night for someone to come to our aid in solving the issue of these fees,” said Naliaka. Kimana's locational chief, Joseph Parmuat, confirmed he knows the family and said Masila’s mother sometimes cannot even raise money to buy food. “I am also appealing to anyone able to come to Masila’s rescue. The boy is very intelligent and wants to be a neurosurgeon after university,” added Parmuat. Daniel Leyian, who has been Masila’s guardian from the time he joined Class One at his primary school, said he could not continue supporting the boy because of financial constraints. The Star was unable to talk to the Machakos School principal to comment on the plight of Masila.
