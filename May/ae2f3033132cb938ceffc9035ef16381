Rangers won through to the Europa League final in sensational style with 3-1 semi-final second-leg victory over RB Leipzig to emerge 3-2 winners on aggregate. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Germany, and in the biggest game at Ibrox in 50 years, Light Blues skipper James Tavernier levelled the tie in the 18th minute with a close-range finish.
