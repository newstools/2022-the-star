Two women have died and a third one left fighting for her life after they were struck by lightning in Gitiri village in Kinangop, Nyandarua. The three were in a group of women who were tilling a farm near Aberdare forest when the accident occurred. Other farmers nearby were forced to flee. Village elder Salton Mbugua said this was the first time such an incident occurred in the area. He said the three were planning to leave the farm before the rains when they were struck around midday. A senior police officer who declined to be named said the bodies had been taken to the local mortuary. Meanwhile, over 20 traders are counting losses after a fire broke out in Eburru trading centre in Gilgil subcounty. No one was injured during the Sunday night incident but traders did not salvage anything. One of the area leaders, Boniface Thuo, said the fire started from one of the houses before spreading to the shopping centre. Lack of water and strong wind worsened the situation. “The incident occurred at around 3 am and the fire spread fast, burning over 20 shops, butcheries and hotels before residents managed to contain it,” he said. Thuo urged Nakuru county to help the traders with donations so that they could restart their businesses.  Edited by Kiilu Damaris
