A video going viral on social media of Elgeyo Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen endorsing ODM leader Raila Odinga is edited. The video has been shared widely on social media with a section of Kenyans saying the Senator endorsed the opposition chief for the top seat as heard in the clip. "So we know who we are voting for. We are voting for Raila Odinga. He can not confuse us by trying to put some cherry on the cake to confuse the people of Kenya. We are very clear in our mind," Murkomen said in the edited clip. Fact-checker has debunked where the senator was addressing from and what his speech was about. Murkomen was addressing the burial service of the brother to the Kenya Kwanza Alliance deputy presidential candidate Rigathi Gachagua on Tuesday. Reriani Gachagua's burial was held in Nyeri county and deputy president William Ruto was present. An excerpt of Murkomen's speech shows that though Murkomen said something like " ...we are voting for Raila Odinga", his earlier statements have been edited to distort the meaning of his speech. "If you are given a poisonous cake then having an icing of a lady will it change the poison that is inside that cake? So we know who we are voting for. We are voting for Raila Odinga. He can not confuse us by trying to put some cherry on the cake to confuse the people of Kenya. We are very clear in our minds," Murkomen said in his unedited speech. Kenyans should therefore disregard the edited version that is widely being shared on social media.
