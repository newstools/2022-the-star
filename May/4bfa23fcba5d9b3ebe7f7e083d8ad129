The Sports Disputes Tribunal (SDT) has halted the National Super League (NSL) and Division One matches for seven days. The development comes a week after eight teams drawn from the second and third tier leagues filed a petition accusing the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Transition Committee of failing to solve glaring disputes arising from matches. Migori Youth, Dandora Love, Gusii United, Zoo Kericho, Kamungei, Kisumu All Stars, Mwatate United and Coastal Heroes filed the case on May 20 through lawyers Ken Ochieng and Japheth Muyendo. Sports journalist, Francis Okello was also enjoined in the petition. Some of the concerns raised by the clubs include blatant biased officiating and unexplained delay in renumerating match officials. SDT chairman John Ohaga said the matter will be mentioned on Tuesday. Editing by Tony Mballa
