A man is fighting for his life at a hospital in Murang’a County after his drink was laced with an unknown substance by a female lover, rendering him unconscious. The man had walked to Small Villa gardens at Kenol on Sunday accompanied by a woman with whom they had several drinks and made merry. DCI boss Kinoti said, the man, an employee at the Ministry of Interior, did not know that the woman had hatched an evil scheme to milk his bank accounts dry. Later at around 11 pm, the man passed out, and the woman was seen gathering his belongings, including ATM cards, Identity Card and mobile phones. Quick response by bar attendants at the joint, saved the man from also losing his possessions to the woman who had allegedly stupefied his drink. Alarmed, they alerted their manager who called the Officer Commanding Kenol Police station, who responded immediately. "The man was rushed to hospital in critical condition, as the woman was booked at Kenol police station. The man’s documents were recovered from her," Kinoti said. Wangechi’s arrest followed an expose by DCI’s detectives, warning men in rural areas to be on high alert when in local pubs. The popular drug used to spike drinks known as ‘Tamuu’ is a depressant used to treat patients with mental illness and has adverse effects, especially when administered to men with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure. "We appreciate the quick action by staff at Small Villa. Other bar owners are asked to be on high alert and notify police officers immediately they notice such peculiarities at their business premises," DCI added.
