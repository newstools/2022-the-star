The Maendeleo Ya Wanawake Organisation Mombasa branch has hailed ODM leader Raila Odinga’s move to pick Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua as his presidential running mate. Addressing the media at the Mama Ngina Waterfront park on Monday afternoon, MYWO Mombasa coordinator Jola said the decision was a win for women in Kenya. She said they will mobilise colleagues to rally behind Raila and Karua. “We had prayed and longed for this. Our desire was for Raila to pick Karua and we are happy he did so,” Jola said. She said they will set up structures at the ward level to ensure  the duo win in August. Jola urged Karua to use the honour bestowed on her to address issues affecting women in the country. She also pleaded with deputy president nominee to address economic empowerment, bursary and drug abuse issues,which have affected the youth of Mombasa. Her sentiments were echoed by Farida Rashid, who said it was a dream come true for women in Kenya as one of their own was about to ascend to the second most powerful seat in the country. “Karua is an epitome of success and we are proud of her hard stance. She always stands for the truth. We believe she is setting the road for women to the State House,” Rashid said. Rashid, who is a former director at the National Authority for Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse, expressed confidence that Karua will deliver. Bi Zena Swaleh, a resident of Majengo in Mvita subcounty, said Raila’s move to pick Karua could be compared to Tanzania President John Magufuli choice of Samia Suluhu, who later took over after Magufuli died. “We want Karua to ensure she pushes for the gender-based cases against women pending in court. She is capable and she will deliver,” she said.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
