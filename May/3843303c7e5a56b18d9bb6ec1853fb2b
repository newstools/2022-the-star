Tennis sensation Angela Okutoyi is polishing the key aspects of her game ahead of next week's Junior French Open at Rolland Garros in Paris. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion bowed out in the first round during the first warm-up tournament in Italy. She lost 6-4, 7-5 to Aruzhan Sagandikova of Kazakhstan last week during the Santa Croce Junior tennis tourney and succumbed 6-1, 6-2 to  England's Rana Aka Stoiber in the first round of the J1 tournament in Milan on Monday. Okutoyi said with hardly a week remaining before the second Grand Slam of the year, she will work on weak areas in readiness for the big event. “ I have like six days to work on my service game which really let me down in the two warm-up tournaments. I want to be in the best shape possible,” he noted. Okutoyi also played in two warm-up tournaments in Morocco and Tunisia in March, where she reached the quarterfinals in preparation for the French Open. She hopes to build on her Australian Open form, where she qualified for the third round. Here she beat Federica Urgesi of Italy 6-4, 6-3; trounced Australia's Zara Larke 7/6 (0), 5-7, 6-1 in the second round before exiting in the third round to Radivojevic of Serbia 6-2 6-3. Okutoyi's coach Thuku Rogoi said they will take one game at a time at the French Open. "Our motto is 'one game at a time. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Okutoyi has a couple of days to work on the game and be in the best possible shape at the event” said Okutoyi. The draws for the junior open will be done on Thursday. At the conclusion of the French Open, Okutoyi will familiarise herself with the grasscourt circuit in preparation for the junior Wimbledon tourney starting on June 27- July 10 in London.
