Spanish omelette, also known as Spanish tortilla, is a Spanish traditional dish, definitely one of the signature dishes in Spanish cuisine. It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes, optionally including onion. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Wash, peel and slice the potatoes, rinse them again and allow them to drain in a colander while you prepare other ingredients. Step 2 Heat vegetable oil in a pan and add the sliced potatoes and chopped onions. Stir fry and season well with salt and pepper. Step 3 Cover and allow those to cook slowly (on low heat) for 15 minutes until the potatoes are nice and soft. Step 4 Meanwhile, whisk the 6 eggs in a large bowl. Whisk them well and season a little more with salt and pepper. Add the whisked eggs to the potato and onion. Mix a little so the egg mixes with the potato and spreads evenly around the pan. Reduce the heat and let it cook uncovered for 7 minutes. Step 5 Cook both sides and when the omelette is ready, take it out onto a serving plate and cut into slices, pizza-like slices. Garnish with Dhania and serve with any salad, crusty bread or cold beverage.
