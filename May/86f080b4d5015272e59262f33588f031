Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki has taken a break from politics and will not be available for any appointive position after the August 9, polls. Speaking at a press conference in a Nairobi hotel, Kindiki said he will be relaxing as he reflects on his future and prepare for a comeback. "I have taken a decision to take a break from elective politics. I will take the break to reorganise myself as I support my party to deliver the presidency," he said. He added that he will not be available for any appointment in Ruto's government even after the August polls. "I will not be seeking any appointive position whatsoever. However, I will be available to seek any position in future that may be available at the national level." Kindiki, however, urged his supporters to back deputy president William Ruto and his running mate Rigathi Gachagua for the presidency. Kindiki said he remains in Kenya Kwanza Alliance to carry on with the dream they had for the people of Kenya. "It was not about me as a person, it was about us as a team." He noted that he will remain in the UDA party and the Kenya Kwanza Alliance because he believes they are going to form the next government. He noted that he is ready to work with party members including  Gachagua who beat him in the race to find Ruto's running mate.
