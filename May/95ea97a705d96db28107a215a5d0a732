The County Government of Kisumu has restricted politicians from holding rallies within the city's CBD and its environs with immediate effect. This is to facilitate the ongoing transformation of the City through urban aesthetics, which according to City Manager, Abala Wanga, is being threatened by vandalism and destruction of public property during the campaign rallies. "The City Management shall designate areas for political gatherings outside the CBD," Wanga said in a Friday notice. He added that they have witnessed cases of vandalism and property damage after the political gatherings. Wanga warned against any non-compliance, adding that any politician violating the notice will be apprehended. On May 6, the County Government redirected traffic flow to create room for aesthetics, which began ahead of the recently concluded Africities Summit. Matatus and buses were directed away from the CBD to Uhuru Business Park Complex while all private vehicles were advised to use the Jomo Kenyatta Highway to Uhuru Business Market as opposed to using the Nyerere Road. City planner Judy Mbala said even though the changes are temporary, there will not be reverting to old routes immediately after the Africities conference. The repainting and aesthetic initiatives were officially launched on April 21 by Governor Anyang Nyong’o. He directed building owners to paint and repaint with lake blue colours and stripes of white. "We have formally asked everyone owning a house in the CBD and its environs to paint them with lake blue colours and stripes of white."
