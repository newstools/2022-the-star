Kimilili Member of parliament Didmus Wekesa Barasa has been questioned after he branded one of the constituency's National Government Constituency Development Fund (NGCDF) motor vehicles with UDA colours and logo. He presented himself before the police on Tuesday evening and spent hours explaining how and why he changed the details of the four-wheel-drive car. This after he learnt he was wanted in a probe into claims of forgery, and theft of a government vehicle among other serious offences. Barasa was accompanied by a lawyer when he went to the Bungoma DCI offices at about 6 pm and was grilled for two hours. He was later released and informed he would be contacted later for processing to appear in court. The detectives said they would send the file to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution with recommendations to charge the MP with forgery and other offences. The police said according to preliminary reports, the forged number plate belongs to the MP's brother. His photo and that of Deputy President William Ruto were also affixed on the vehicle. Kimilili sub-county police boss  Mwita Maroa said that the vehicle with original registration number GK948J was impounded in the homestead of the lawmaker at Nasianda village on Tuesday morning. "The contingent stormed the homestead following extensive investigations and towed the vehicle to Kimilili police station and later to Bungoma before heading to Nairobi," he said. He said police acted on a tip-off from members of the public who raised complaints after seeing the vehicle in the MP's campaign rallies. Maroa said that the vehicle had a fake number plate KBS 709D. He said that it's against the law to use government vehicles for personal issues and campaign matters. He said that the lawmaker is likely to face charges of forgery, and theft of a government vehicle among other serious offences. Barasa did not respond to our queries. His handlers said he was busy in campaigns in the area.
