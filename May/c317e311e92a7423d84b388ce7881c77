Deputy President William Ruto has said the High Court lacks the power to hear and determine a case filed by a Mau Mau veteran seeking his removal from office. Ruto has been under pressure from his boss President Uhuru Kenyatta, and other leaders, calling for his resignation. During the Labour Day celebrations, Uhuru launched an attack against his deputy, accusing him of absconding duty and inciting Kenyans against the government. But Ruto in a rejoinder, hit back, saying Uhuru sabotaged his own government. Michael Kirungia said Ruto has abdicated his constitutional roles as the principal assistant to the President and embarked on “self-assigned duties.” He wants him removed from office because he is not performing the functions conferred by the constitution and any other functions of the President as the head of state may assign. “Ruto, who is the deputy president, is illegally using public funds in conducting his own assignment of UDA meetings countrywide for the 2022 presidential election campaign," Kirungia said. He also wants Ruto restrained from using the Office of the Deputy President and DP residential home in conducting meetings of UDA until the case is heard and determined. But Ruto wants the matter dismissed on grounds that it is an abuse of the court process. “Kirungia is inviting the court to embark in an academic exercise which is a waste of judicial time. The suit is incompetent and defective,” Ruto, through Mutuma Gichuru and Associates Advocates, said. The law firm said the case does not raise any issues that can be tried or tested for determination. It also said the case has not disclosed any specific acts that are in breach of the law to cause judicial intervention.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
