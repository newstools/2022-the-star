President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto on Thursday met for a Cabinet meeting. The two met at State House in Nairobi, where the head of state is chairing the meeting. A statement from the State House said issues to do with national and international importance will be discussed during the meeting. "His Excellency President Uhuru Kenyatta is today, at State House, Nairobi, chairing a full Cabinet meeting during which several matters of national and international importance will be discussed," read the tweet. DP Ruto has on several occasions claimed that he had not attended cabinet meetings after his duties were allegedly handed to Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i. Ruto has been conspicuously missing in previous Cabinet meetings. This is also the first time Uhuru has called for a cabinet meeting in over a year. The Cabinet is expected to sit every Thursday to discuss pertinent issues affecting the government.
