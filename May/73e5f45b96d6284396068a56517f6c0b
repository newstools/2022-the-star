Miley Cyrus has detailed the complicated process she goes through to communicate with Dolly Parton. During an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Monday. Host Seth mentioned the T-Mobile Super Bowl commercial the popstar starred in alongside her famous godmother earlier this year. However, Miley pointed out that the gig was rather ironic, as Dolly, 76, rarely uses a phone. "It was amazing because she was doing it for the phones, yet every time I coordinate and communicate with Dolly it's still through fax. She's rarely on the phone."
