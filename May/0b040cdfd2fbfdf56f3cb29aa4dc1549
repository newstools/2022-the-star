Former regional commissioner George Natembeya has taken his campaigns a notch higher by launching a website to reach out to his people. Natembeya, who is the Azimio la Umoja’s Candidate in Trans Nzoia, on Saturday said the move seeks to facilitate access to the people. "The COVID-19 Pandemic made technology a very critical platform in the dissemination of information. We will utilize this technology as we rally residents of Trans Nzoia to vote for us," he said during the launch. "The website will enable us to reach well-wishers and supporters within Trans Nzoia and beyond to assist us in this journey. This is a common practice in most of the world economies." He said the website was funded by the ordinary citizens who are backing his bid Natembeya at the same time asked Kenyans to embrace the culture of fundraising for candidates seeking elective positions as a way of curbing corruption. "Electoral laws must be tightened to ensure public officers who are eying elective positions don’t divert funds to their campaigns as is the norm in Kenya today. Those who use their funds in campaigns steal to recover while in office,"  he noted. He said voters need to be allowed to make their own decisions ahead of the August 9, polls "There are many falsehoods being propagated against me in matters of finances, it’s not about me but the people who need to be allowed to make their own decisions at the ballot," he said.
