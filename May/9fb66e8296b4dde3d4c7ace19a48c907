Kenya Commercial Bank volleyball team began their medal hunt at the African Women’s Club Volleyball Championship in Tunisia with a resounding 3-0 victory over Asec Mimmosas of Ivory Coast. The bankers, who are in pool 'B' alongside defending champions de Carthage of Tunisia and Ethiopia's NALF, rolled over their opponents in sets of 25-13 25-12 and 25 - 10 in the one-sided affair. The 11-day tournament has attracted 16 teams with Kenya's other representatives being Kenya Pipeline and Kenya Prisons. De Carthage will pose a big threat to KCB's ambitions but in Mercy Moim, Sharon Chepchumba and captain Edith Wisa, the bankers have enough ammunition to charge for continental glory. KCB last won the title in 2006 under coach Paul Bitok who is now the technical director. Both 2007 and 2008 saw the Japheth Munala tutored KCB bag silver. Elsewhere, Kenya Prisons made light work of Nigeria's CNS, slaying the West Africans by the same scoreline. The Wardresses managed sets of 25-19 25-18 and 25-20. Prisons started a quality field that had Lorine Chebet, Ann Lowem and captain Brackcides Agala. The defending champions of the Kenya Volleyball Federation league, Prisons, will battle it out with Ethiopia's National Alcohol and APR of Rwanda in pool C. Editing by Tony Mballa
