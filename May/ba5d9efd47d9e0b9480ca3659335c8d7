The governments of Morocco and Kenya are increasing minimum wage. Speaking at Labour Day celebrations in Nairobi, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said a rise of 12% was necessary to help workers cope with a surge in consumer prices, which has been partly driven by the war in Ukraine. Kenyans have seen commodities, including cooking oil and fuel, go up in price, exacerbated by supply concerns following the Russian invasion. Meanwhile, in Morocco, the government announced plans to increase the minimum wage for public servants by 16%. For other workers, the increase will be 10%.
