Game management will be key for Simbas' final three Currie Cup fixtures, says head coach Paul Odera. The Simbas recorded their first win of the campaign, beating Border Bulldogs 35-12 last weekend, but the tactician said there is room for improvement ahead of their final three fixtures, with two fixtures on home soil. “Our management of the game needs to improve. We need to know when to increase the tempo and also when to slow down the game and at the same play in the right areas of the field,” said Odera. However, the former national team skipper was delighted with the improvement in their scrum and lineout with a 100 percent success rate in both facets of play. "I'm happy we were able to dominate the scrums and line outs and put pressure on their ball and at the same time play with the intensity," added Odera. The Simbas play South West District Eagles next Saturday before flying home to face the Leopards and Eastern Province on June 4 and 11 respectively at the RFUEA ground. Odera expects a competitive performance from his charges in the remaining matches as they gear up for the World Cup qualifiers in July. "We have seen improvement in the last couple of weeks and I hope we can be competitive against the Eagles and in our final two matches of the season,” he observed. The Simbas lost all their opening matches 51-14 to Valke, 22-21 to Zimbabwe and 66-33 to the Griffon Eagles to currently sit ninth on the log with seven points. The Simbas are using the Currie Cup as preparations for the Rugby World Cup qualifiers slated for France in July.
