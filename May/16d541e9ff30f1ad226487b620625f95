The parents of Azimio coalition deputy presidential candidate Martha Karua have received with gratitude the appointment of their daughter as ODM leader Raila Odinga's running mate. Jackson Karua and Josephine Wanjiru have said Martha was a responsible child who avoided peer influence while growing up. They noted that her character will help Raila in delivering a presidency that will change the lives of many Kenyans. "She had a habit of choosing the best, never following crowds, that has been her stand since birth," Wanjiru said. Speaking in an interview with Citizen TV on  Monday, they expressed their joy on Martha's nomination as the Azimio presidential running mate. "Alikuwa mpole kwa mambo yake na mchangamfu na alijitahidi sana shule na nyumbani," Wanjiru said. Loosely translated to, "She was humble and full of life, and she worked hard both at school and at home." Karua said she is looking forward to helping Raila deliver development to the people of Kenya and liberate it from the york of poverty. "I pray to God to guide them to lead this country to be better than they found it." Wanjiru added that Karua will make a great deputy president if Raila is elected president. They said their daughter detests corruption and political insults. "The two of them have come from far together and both of them hate corruption, if they win, this country will be in great hands." Their reactions came shortly after Martha was unveiled as Raila's running mate earlier at the Kenyatta International Convention Center, Nairobi. Raila said his decision to choose a female deputy was informed by the need for gender equality in the male-dominated political field.
