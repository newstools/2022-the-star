Candidates who have been cleared to run for elective posts in Kakamega have called for peaceful campaigns. The IEBC started vetting aspirants on Sunday. Among those cleared is Shinyalu parliamentary candidate Fred Ikana, who is running on the ANC party ticket. “Let’s all be careful with how we conduct our campaigns and stop throwing insults at each other or fighting each other because life must continue after the elections," Ikana said. Timothy Vikiru, who is seeking the Lurambi MP seat on the National Reconstruction Alliance party ticket, urged politicians to desist from involving youths in activities that would lead to violence during the campaigns. “As we go about our campaigns seeking votes, our peace and harmony is very important. These are public seats and each can only be occupied by one person at a time," he said. Kakamega Jubilee senator candidate Sammy Aina said campaigns should be issue-based. He urged the government to ensure proper security for the aspirants and the public during the electioneering period. “Every candidate should be allowed to sell their policies regardless of where they come from and party or coalition affiliation. The government should ensure campaigns are carried out within the law,” Aina said. Stanley Khainga, the ANC candidate for the Lurambi parliamentary seat, asked the police force to be on alert to avert any planned commotion and violence among supporters of different candidates. Lurambi constituency returning officer Salim Abdalla warned that action will be taken against any candidate found violating electoral laws. Edited by A.N
