Sofapaka head coach David Ouma has extolled his charges for holding off a tough challenge to pip Vihiga Bullets 1-0 in a closely contested encounter at Kasarani Annex on Saturday. Ouma said they put up a gallant fight to contain a team whose spirited fight was inspired by the urge to evade relegation. Rody Manga was the toast for Sofapaka, netting the goal that separated the sides at full time. “It was a tough game given our opponents were determined to come out of the relegation zone. I'm glad we managed to defend well up to the final whistle," Ouma said. As Ouma enumerated his gains, his counterpart Abdallah Juma placed their debacle at the feet of a squad that took too long to warm up to the match. "We concede early in the match and it was an uphill task to chase the match,” Abdalla said. The loss has thrown the spanner in the works for Vihiga who had hoped to use the fixture to boost their chances of evading relegation. Juma, however, remains optimistic even as their survival chances get more complicated. “We still have a chance to survive relegation and we intend to fight up to the last minute. Hopefully, we shall use our final two matches to save our skins," he said. Ouma was forced to tinker with his lineup early in the game when Nixon Omondi came on for Titus Achesa who was stretchered off after sustaining an injury on the half-hour mark. Editing by Tony Mballa
