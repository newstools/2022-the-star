An image in form of a press statement showing that Safaricom responded to remarks made by Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua in an interview on a vernacular radio station is fake. The fake statement has been widely shared on social media by a section of Kenyans thus misleading the masses. While flagging the statement as fake, Safaricom asked Kenyans to rely on communication posted on their verified social media handles. "Please note that all our official communication is shared through our verified social media channels." Gachagua went viral on social media on Tuesday following his remarks on empowering small business operators for them to fall into the tax bracket. This, he said, will help in the generation of more resources for the country. Varied interpretations of his speech that he made in Kikuyu dialect emerged causing mixed reactions among Kenyans. Safaricom was drawn into the saga because the MP had mentioned it in his remarks.
