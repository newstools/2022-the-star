Scotland coach Steve Clarke named a 28-man squad on Monday for their World Cup playoff semi-final and their Nations League fixtures next month with Arsenal left-back Kieran Tierney the biggest omission. Scotland play Ukraine at Hampden Park on June 1 in the playoff semi-final that was postponed from March following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. If Scotland win, they will play Wales in Cardiff on June 5 for a spot in the World Cup finals in Qatar later this year. Arsenal’s Tierney was ruled out for the rest of the season due to a knee injury that required surgery but Everton's right-back Nathan Patterson has recovered from ankle surgery to make the cut. Scotland also play three Nations League fixtures next month against Armenia —home and away— and Ireland. Scotland Squad —Goalkeepers: Zander Clark (St Johnstone), Craig Gordon (Heart of Midlothian), Liam Kelly (Motherwell), David Marshall (Queens Park Rangers); Defenders: Liam Cooper (Leeds United), Grant Hanley (Norwich City), Jack Hendry (Club Brugge KV), Aaron Hickey (Bologna FC), Scott McKenna (Nottingham Forrest), Stephen O’Donnell (Motherwell), Nathan Patterson (Everton), Anthony Ralston (Celtic), Andy Robertson (Liverpool), John Souttar (Heart of Midlothian), Greg Taylor (Celtic); Midfielders: Stuart Armstrong (Southampton), Lewis Ferguson (Aberdeen), Billy Gilmour (Chelsea), Ryan Jack (Rangers), John McGinn (Aston Villa), Callum McGregor (Celtic), Scott McTominay (Manchester United), David Turnbull (Celtic); Forwards: Che Adams (Southampton), Jacob Brown (Stoke City), Ryan Christie (Bournemouth), Lyndon Dykes (Queens Park Rangers), Ross Stewart (Sunderland).
