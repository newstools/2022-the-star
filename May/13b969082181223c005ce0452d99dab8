Former Kiambu County Woman Representative and President Uhuru Kenyatta's cousin Annah Nyokabi Gatheca has dropped out of the Kiambu Governor seat race and will instead deputise Thika town MP Patrick Wainaina alias Wajungle. The duo who are vying for the county's coveted seat on an independent ticket will face the incumbent James Nyoro (Jubilee), former Governor William Kabogo (Tujibembe Wakenya Party), Senator Kimani Wamatangi (UDA) and Kanu's Juliet Kimemia. Wainaina while unveiling Nyokabi said she will be bringing her leadership prowess to his team having served as the region's first Woman Representative. Nyokabi on the other hand has described Wainaina as a development-oriented leader and someone who is not tainted with graft. She said he is the best candidate to take Kiambu to greater heights.
