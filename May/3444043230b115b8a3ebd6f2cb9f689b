Ugandan cyclist Charles Kagimu says he is looking forward to renewing his rivalry against Kenyan Salim Kipkemboi as he targets a great performance at Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England in August. Kagimu won the 100km race during the Eldoret Cycle 100 contest in 2:38.19 ahead of Kipkemboi (2:38.20) and Paul Lomuria (2:47.07), who placed second and third respectively. The Ugandan opened up about his race as well as his affinity for Kenya, compared to his birthplace. “Kenya is more home than Uganda because I came to this country when I was a teenager. The competition was stiff but my training gave me the best results,” Kagimu, who trains in Kaptagat, said. The experienced cyclist has also competed in the Tour of Thailand, Tour of Rwanda, Africa Championships and Africa Championships Road race. Elsewhere, Kipkemboi — who has likewise qualified for the Club Games — said the competition was a chance for him to sharpen himself for Birmingham. “I have a busy calendar and finishing second here, with my teammate winning, is part of the best training for me. I have three important races so far and I need endurance, which I have managed today,” said Kipkemboi, 23, said. Kipkemboi, who last month finished seventh at the Tour of Thailand,  also set his focus on next month's Route Occitanle in France and Sibiu Cycling Tour in Romania. The 100km riders covered Uasin Gishu and Elgeyo Marakwet with the aim of conserving Kaptagat Forest which also covers the two counties. In the Black Mamba category, Joseph Gachora was the victor in 1:20.08 followed by Gibson Alwanda (1:20.09) and John Muchiri completing the podium in 1:24.20. Peter Karanja won the Mountain Bike category in 3:06.56 followed by Julius Kaiguara (3:17.15 and Joseph Kariuki (3:29.24). Joyce Nyaruri (3:38.50) won the women's 100km race.
