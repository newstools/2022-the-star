Progressive Party of Kenya aspirant for Luanda MP Seat Boaz Magomere has suffered a blow after his key allies decamped to his opponent Noah Okaya. Magomere’s campaign team led by his chairman Robert Odinga and personal assistant Dickson Ombaka, while switching the camp, said their candidate hasn’t shown any political interest to clinch the seat. Magomere was criticized by his campaign team for failing to show seriousness in his fight for MP's seat. Odinga said as Magomere's campaign team leader, they have not held any serious campaigns in the Luanda constituency with their boss something that forced them to exit. “There is no need to labour where your boss seems not too serious about what you are fighting for,” Odinga said. “We have decided to decamp from Magomere's camp to Okaya's camp." Okaya welcomed his opponent's defectors promising to walk with them in his struggle ahead of the August polls. Both Magomere and Okaya hail from the same area of Luanda East where a majority of voters come from. Okaya is contesting on the Amani National Congress party (ANC) ticket led by Musalia Mudavadi under Kenya Kwanza. "I have received defectors from one of my opponents in the Luanda constituency and I'm very happy because that is a plus to me," said Okaya. Other aspirants fighting to unseat Christopher Omulele of ODM includes Albert Obui (Jubilee), Tom Atingo (UDA) and Eng. Dick Maungu( DAP-K). Efforts to reach Boaz Magomere to hear his side of the story on the developments were futile as he failed to pick up our calls and respond to our text messages. The incumbent MP has welcomed his opponents to face him on the ballot. Omulele who is well resourced and a good mobilizer said he is prepared to face his opponents. “I have my brothers who have shown interest in the Luanda constituency seat and I welcome them. Let us play friendly politics because it is within their democratic right to vie for any seat," said Omulele.
