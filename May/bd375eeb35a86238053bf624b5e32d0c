Former Nairobi governor Mike Sonko is at the center of controversy after a family in Mombasa accused him of using their late mother´s grave for political mileage. In a video clip circulated on the socials, a member of the aggrieved family is heard warning Sonko to look for his mother´s grave elsewhere. The man said the grave which Sonko said was that of his late mother was that of their late mother who died seven years ago and her remains were interred at the Kikowani Muslim cemetery. "Itś so sad and painful for Sonko to come here and claim that this is his mothers grave. Let Sonko look for his mothers grave. This one is not it," the man said amid sobs. Sonko is eyeing the Mombasa governor seat on a Wiper party ticket. In a separate video, the flamboyant politician is seen sobbing by a grave as Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and a group of other people comfort him. Kalonzo is in Mombasa on a three-day campaign tour of the Azimio la Umoja-One Kenya Alliance. "And you Kalonzo, how do you get embroiled in this type of falsehoods?" asked the man. He asked Sonko to go back and apologize.
