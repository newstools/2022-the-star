National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has declared he has no intention of serving in the post in the Parliament that would be formed after the August 9 General Election. "I have said that having done two terms, I wouldn't want to continue any longer. I feel it is fair to allow other Kenyans to take the mantle," he said. Muturi, while at a parliamentary reporters' retreat, also revealed plans to extend the calendar of Parliament for at least one week. He said this would be to enable a consonance in the adjournments of both the National Assembly and the Senate. "It doesn't make sense that the House which considers over 95 per cent of national legislation goes home earlier," Muturi said. He was confident a lot has improved during his time as speaker and urged kenyans as well as state agencies to strive to understand the operations of the House. "The judiciary has been interpreting some of our processes but we find cases where they have not appreciated what the rulings mean," he said. Parliament, as per its current calendar, is only left with 12 sittings amid an array of crucial businesses which must be resolved before the sine die recess. More to follow...
