Sprints coach Stephen Mwaniki is full of praise for the Kenyan sprinters ahead of the Senior Africa Athletics Championships set for Mauritius next month. Mwaniki said the team, which was selected in sprints recently, is one of the best and he does not see why they can't win medals. “The 4x100m relay is a technical event and it must be well-coordinated and executed if one is to be successful. "We won a bronze in 4x100m in the last event in Asaba, Nigeria and there is no reason for us not to increase the tally. We have the best sprinters in the country led by Ferdinand Omanyala,  who is the current Africa record holder,” he said. Mwaniki said if the athletes can synchronize with the baton exchange, he doesn't see a team that will stand in their way. “During the national championships, we had three teams which were able to run 39 seconds, and with proper training, and synchronization of the baton, I don't see why we can't run 37 seconds," said Mwaniki. He said, for now, the sprinters need to train together, gel properly and results will follow. He cited South Africa and Botswana as the biggest threat but assured that with what is happening on the local scene, he feels they have what it takes to scale the ladder. He said for the country to prevail in the relays, they need to work on the baton. “Considering the athletes are drawn from different departments including Kenya Defence Forces, Kenya Prisons Service, and Kenya Police Service, we need to work on their chemistry," said Mwaniki.
