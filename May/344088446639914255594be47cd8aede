Azimio la Umoja president candidate Raila Odinga will on Monday take his campaigns to Kajiado County. The ODM leader will be touring the county days after Wiper supporters urged Azimio to pick Kalonzo Musyoka as Raila's deputy. Deputy President William Ruto will, on the other hand, tour Samburu Country. The DP will visit the Maa Nation to sell his bottom-up agenda after his campaign tour in Busia, Bungoma and Trans-Nzoia counties on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Ruto on Sunday had vowed to liberate farmers and small businesses from brokers and high-interest loans once elected as president. "We will set aside Sh50 billion. We will make the loan rates low so we can reach every small business owner, be it mama mboga or boda boda," he said during a Trans Nzoia County campaign tour. These campaigns are in a bid to rally as many as 50+1 votes ahead of the August 9 General Elections.
