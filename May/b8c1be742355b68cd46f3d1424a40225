A US-based company dealing with dietary supplements and beauty products, Max International has announced its entry into the Kenyan market. The company, set to be launched on Saturday, May 14, 2022, will be based in Nairobi. This will be the company's first entry into the East African market, valued at multi-billion shillings. Ahead of the launch, Max International CEO Joseph F. Voyticky said that Max Beauty is a makeup line designed to help women across the world celebrate their beauty boldly and with confidence. “One of the most effective ways to do so is to ensure that our immune systems are in better shape and one of the proven ways to that is to live well and enhance our level of Glutathione,” Voyticky pointed out. He added that Max’s nutraceutical products focus on helping body cells to produce glutathione or support glutathione’s functions. Glutathione plays a role as an antioxidant and an anti-toxin, effectively providing a major defence system against illness and ageing. The Company launched in the US in 2007 and is currently operating in 20 different countries. Max has 11 offices in West Africa and 13 in the whole of the African continent. “One of Max’s commitments is to bring world-class products and business opportunities to all of Africa,” Voyticky reiterated. In 2022, Max is set to grow its wings in Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
