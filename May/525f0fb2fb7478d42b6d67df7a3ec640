Team Kenya will be seeking to retain the girls' Under-16 and Under-14 categories at the Confederation of Africa Tennis East Africa Zone Championships in Kigali, Rwanda starting today. Seline Ahoya, who did the country proud in the U-12 East Africa event in Kigali last weekend, will spearhead the girls' U-14 category alongside Melissa Mwakha and Stacey Yego. In the U- 16  category, Faith Urasa, Reha Kipsang, and Hadassah Mjine will fly the country's flag. The boys' U-14 trio of  Baraka Ominde, Brian Nyakundi, and Ayush Bhandari will be seeking to emulate the girls' feat while Liberty Baraka, Gilbert Wechuli, and Alvin Kimathi will be the country's hope in the U- 16. Kenya will be up against hosts Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Tanzania in the week-long championship. Team captain Joseph Karanja said the goal for the boys will be to upstage Uganda. "Uganda is the team to beat and the boys have vowed to do all they can to win. We are going all out to win both titles," he said. Fresh from winning the U-12 category at the same venue last week, Ahoya said she is relishing the challenge of facing older girls in the category. "I am confident I will do well. The hard work the coaches have put in will keep me motivated and well prepared," she quipped. Co-captain Rose Owino said the girls' will not be complacent having won the championship two years ago in Tanzania. "We can't afford to be complacent. The rest of the teams will be keen to make a mark and we must be prepared for a tough battle," added Owino. She said both teams have trained hard and are looking forward to posting impressive results in the competition.
