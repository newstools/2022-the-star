The British Council based in Kenya has pledged to support the Ministry of Health by training 22,000 nurses as a part of the Kenya-UK Health Alliance, starting May 7. The nurses will be recruited by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom over a period of three years. In a statement, the Council said that the training has been made possible as there are six already trained KMTC trainers who will equip them with the necessary skills to pass the IELTS test. The initiative will help to ensure that nurses have guideline on how to answer questions and tackle any challenges they may face. "This initiative by the British Council Kenya will help test takers prepare better so that they can achieve the scores they need. We will facilitate closed English test sessions for KMTC students only, beginning May 7," Council Director Jill Coates said. "The initiative is in response to the request by MoH for the British Council to train the trainers who will prepare the candidates to acquire the requisite score and enable them to qualify to work in the UK." The IELTS test is an English proficiency test for immigrating to the UK, Australia, United States of America (USA), Canada, and New Zealand. "Whether to work, study, or immigration, IELTS ensures that candidates have the language ability to be productive in their destination country." The Council warned that passing the test requires more than just being able to speak, read, and write in English.
