The West Pokot government has bought nine motorcycles to help with a survey on crop and livestock prices. The information will be shared with players nationally to link farmers to sellers. Governor John Lonyangapuo flagged off the motorcycles on Thursday. He said the county has ventured into agriculture and that is why they have begun to look for markets for their produce. Lonyangapuo said his government is committed to linking farmers to markets in the region. Currently, the county is producing fruits and vegetables in highland areas, he said. “The county has helped in supplying farm inputs to farmers and we have now moved to the next step to look for markets for the farmers,” Lonyangapuo said. He said the motorcycles will also be used to offer extension services to farmers in hard-to-reach areas. “We want to ensure all farmers are well covered, even those in far-flung areas,” Lonyangapuo said. The markets to be surveyed include those in Mnagei, Kapenguria, Kodich, Chepareria, Endough, Sook, Lomut and Sekerr wards. Lonyangapuo said his administration is committed to totally eradicating livestock diseases. He launched vaccination against East Coast Fever at Kipkorinya, Kaibos and Siyoi targeting 8,000 livestock. The governor said the region has a large livestock market that is why they are collaborating with stakeholders to ensure animals are free from diseases. “Most of the meat consumed in the country comes from this region that’s why we want to ensure Kenyans get quality meat by preventing diseases,” he said.
