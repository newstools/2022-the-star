Jubilee officials in Tans Nzoia have denied the party is supporting former ODM aspirant Moses Khaoya and Esther Koli for governor. Led by the county party secretary Francis Wangila, the officials said the party had not okayed any other person to vie as governor for Trans Nzoia apart from former Rift Valley regional coordinator George Natembeya who is backed by all parties in Azimio La Umoja One Kenya Coalition. Wangila rubbished multiple reports doing rounds on social media that Jubilee had teamed up with ODM to support Khaoya and Koli against Natembeya. "There is no way Jubilee Party can  go against the party leader’s wish supporting Natembeya’s bid. Our presidential candidate Raila Odinga who heads ODM stated clearly here in Trans Nzoia that Natembeya is the man," Wangila said. He said the party is fully behind Natembeya who, he said,  has emerged as the frontrunner for the seat. “We already have only one  Azimio La Umoja One Kenya  candidate for the position of governor and it is foolhardy for someone to daydream of being fielded as an alternative. This is hogwash and those doing this nonsense should stop," he said. Wangila told Khaoya and Koli to stop misleading members of the public and instead support Natembeya to clinch the seat. "Anyone going against the Azimio la Umoja One Kenya Alliance is an enemy of the progress we are yearning for in Trans Nzoia and the country at large,’’ he said. He also dismissed as false claims that there were divisions among the Azimio coalition parties in the county, saying opponents had regrouped to plant seeds of discord thinking there would be a fallout. He exuded confidence that Natembeya will win the Trans Nzoia governorship race and help jumpstart the economic livelihoods of residents who have been left behind due to mismanagement.
