The suspect behind the brutal killing of Kenya Institute of Mass Communication student Purity Wangechi, and two of his accomplices, were Sunday arrested. The mastermind, John Wanyoike Kibungi, 24, was smoked out of his hideout at Kirigiti, Kiambu County, on Sunday morning as he prepared to escape, following a manhunt launched Saturday by a combined team of detectives and general duty police officers. Also arrested were two of his accomplices, Kanaiya Kamau and Brendan Muchiri, accused of being behind the killing of the 19-year-old college student and disposing of her body. Wangechi’s body, which bore visible stab wounds and strangulation marks, was discovered Saturday morning by the roadside close to Mburiria estate, in Kiambu County. Wangechi had fallen in love with one of the suspects and they had been in a relationship for some time before she discovered that he was a thug. She confronted him about it leading to a misunderstanding between the two. She, however, didn’t know that her lover was determined to cover his tracks by eliminating her. According to police, on Friday, Wangeci left the country’s premier media institution to meet him in Kirigiti, to try and rekindle the dying embers of their once blossoming love. She did not know that she was walking into a death trap. During the early morning raid, the officers also recovered a vegetable knife suspected to have been used in the killing of the 19-year-old. The detectives also discovered the scene of the murder that was preserved for forensic examination by Crime scene personnel based at the DCI National Forensic Laboratory. Meanwhile, the three suspects were placed in custody for the offence of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code.
