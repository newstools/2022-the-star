Claims that Machakos governor Alfred Mutua is vying for Mwala parliamentary seat are fake. The reports have been going viral on social media alleging the second-term governor has decided to seek a parliamentary seat to "secure his political future". A list purported to have originated from the IEBC also showed the name of Mutua among aspirants seeking MP seats in Machakos county. In response to the reports, Mutua told this writer that he is not eyeing any seat in the August 9, elections. "Fake news. I am not vying for any seat," Mutua said when asked to clarify the reports.
