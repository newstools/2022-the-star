Hundreds of Muslims in Garissa joined their counterparts around the globe to celebrate Eid al-Fitr on Monday. The event, which marks the end of Ramadan saw faithfuls stream into the prayer grounds and mosques as early as 7 am. For Muslims worldwide, Eid al-Fitr ends the Islamic holy month of fasting and prayer. It is one of the largest and most important celebrations in the Islamic calendar. Kenyans were treated for a five-day weekend after Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i declared Tuesday a public holiday to mark Eid al- Fitr. The government also declared Friday, April 29 a national holiday following the death of former President Mwai Kibaki. At the Rtd general Mohamud’s Eid prayer grounds, local leaders who took part in the celebrations said Muslim faithfuls should be generous toward the poor as they celebrate the festival. Abakaile MCA Mohamed Ali said Kenyans should choose their leaders wisely during August polls. Mohamed who is minority leader at the Garissa county assembly said the only way Kenyans will stop lamenting after polls, is for them to choose visionary leaders. “It’s upon you as citizens and voters to choose the person who will bring development to your county and country at large. Instead of regretting after four years, this is the right time to choose wisely,” he said. The MCA who is also the Garissa ODM chairman, used the opportunity to drum up support for the Azimio presidential candidate Raila Odinga. “Raila has the best interests for the Muslim community. During his tenure as the country’s prime minister, an immigration passport office was established in Garissa town and the office left with him,” he said. The legislator said residents should vote for Raila in the August polls. “Raila is the only leader who will honestly bring change to the Muslim community and in particular Northeastern,” he said.
