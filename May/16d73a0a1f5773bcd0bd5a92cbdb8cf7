Governor Alfred Mutua has ditched the Azimio la Umoja coalition party and joined the Kenya Kwanza Alliance. He said on Monday morning that the Maendeleo Chap Chap party had signed an agreement with Kenya Kwanza on Sunday night after they were sidelined in Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja. The Maendeleo Chap Chap leader said the party believes William Ruto is the best to liberate Kenyans from the york of poverty. "Deputy President William Ruto is a good man and he will change this country. Last night we signed an agreement with Kenya Kwanza and here is a copy," he told the press. "Unlike Azimio, here is a document we signed and we know its content," he said. "They played us and sneaked a document on zoning. They have been doing nothing but managing us," he said. On the exit clause, he said the constitution guarantees freedom of association. "You cannot force people to be in an association they are not respected in," Mutua said. He said they agreed with Ruto on zero zoning. "All our aspirants will be on the ballot. We also agreed on the role we'll play when Kenya Kwanza wins and vice versa." He said more parties have indicated they will be on their way out too. He didn't reveal the names. Mutua has been protesting exclusion from the Azimio coalition. On Friday, he claimed that the Registrar and the Azimio La Umoja-One Kenya Coalition refused to give them a copy of the Azimio coalition agreement. Earlier, Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula congratulated Mutua and PAA party leader Amason Kingi for joining Kenya Kwanza Alliance. The Bungoma Senator said the duo’s entry brings in additional energy to the coalition ahead of the August 9 General Election. "Congratulations Maendeleo Chap Chap and PAA political parties for joining the Kenya Kwanza Alliance Coalition. Your entry brings in additional energy and guarantees, even more, Kenya Kwanza Alliance’s assured victory in the August 9 General elections. Hongera," he said.
