At least seven people have been arrested by the National Environment Management Authority over the discharge of untreated wastewater in Mombasa. The individuals were nabbed during a week-long crackdown on companies and firms that do not comply with the Environment Management and Coordination Act. Coast region Nema director Wachira Bore said the authority is undertaking a countrywide 100 days Rapid Response Initiative, targeting firms and institutions discharging wastewater to the environment Bore said the crackdown aims at creating awareness and ensuring firms comply with the Environment Act. “We have been in the region for a week, conducting this crackdown. Our focus is on wastewater quality regulation and its discharge to the environment.” He called on the public and business owners to visit Nema offices for voluntary compliance or be forced to do so. The crackdown targets fuel stations, hotels, depots, clubs and apartments and any other facility discharging wastewater “We have arrested seven individuals, five complied while two will face charges in court. We are encouraging voluntary compliance, we don’t have to come and close your premises for you to do so,” he said. The operation started in Mombasa and will be rolled to other counties. He said they also want to enlighten the public on the dangers of discharging wastewater into the environment including oceans. “Untreated wastewater is harmful to the marine environment, there are other forms of life in the sea that get affected. We must ensure water going to the ocean is treated,” he said. Bore said the Act requires all facilities discharging wastewater must have a bio-digester to treat the water before it is safely discharged out. Failure to comply will attract Sh2 million fine or a jail term. “We have partnered with the National Police Service to ensure action is taken against those who fail to comply. We are however encouraging voluntary compliance at the moment,” he said.  (Edited by Tabnacha O)
