Monday kicks off what is likely to be the final week of testimony in the blockbuster legal battle between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Here's a look at what the former couple have said about each other on the witness stand. Amber Heard: When Amber Heard took the stand, jurors heard a wildly different account of her relationship with Depp than offered by his team. Heard, like her ex-husband, described an intense and immediate connection between the pair. "I felt like butterflies. I couldn't see straight," she said. But that connection was marred, Heard testified, by a sudden transformation. Depp would disappear for days, she claimed, and return drunk, high and angry. She described a variety of violent outbursts - slaps, head butts and sharp kicks to the head - and disturbing episodes of sexual assault throughout their relationship. "I was so scared that it was going to end really badly for me," Heard told the jury of her decision to file for divorce in 2016. "I had to leave him," she said. "I knew I wouldn't survive if I didn't. Depp has denied all allegations of assault. Johnny Depp: Throughout the trial, Depp has portrayed his ex-wife as a volatile spouse who abused and demeaned him. After the romance of their first year together soured, the pair argued regularly, Depp said. Heard frequently issued a "sarcastic, demeaning, aggressive, violent, toxic spew", and occasionally resorted to violence, he said. Depp told the jury: "She has a need for conflict. She has a need for violence." Heard has admitted to striking her former partner on several occasions, after "years of not defending myself". But Heard said she was never "abusive" to Depp.
