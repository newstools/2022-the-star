AFC Leopards supporters have been in a class of their own this season, bringing back the pomp and glamour to our colorless stadia. With their trademark blue and white replica club jerseys and the stentorian isukuti drum beats, Ingwe fans undoubtedly light up the Kenyan Premier League matches. Most importantly, they inject some oomph into the otherwise mundane streets, before and after matches. The Isukuti team comprise vibrant and stylish young men and women who electrify the stadium by shaking and rolling their shoulders as well as gyrating their hips to the enchanting beats, as the rest of the battalion bellow out a well synchronized chorus at the stands. This afternoon, Leopards are urging their fans to flock the stands again as they face debutants Talanta at Nyayo Stadium in one of the final crunch ties that might as well decide their fate in the top ten bracket. “It's match day. Our second last home match of the season. Let's all turn up at Nyayo Stadium and support the team. Show some love for AFC Leopards,” read a post on the club's official Facebook page. Whereas their supporters have never disappointed this season, the playing unit has failed to rise to the occasion many a times. A torrid start to the season and a lackadaisical run in the course of their upheaval journey has denied them a perfect opportunity to end their 20-year title drought. They are currently rooted at the middle of the table in position 8 with 42 points. They must look over their shoulders given there exists a pack of predators hot on their heels and equally interested in a top-ten finish. Editing by Tony Mballa
