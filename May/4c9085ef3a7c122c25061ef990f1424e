Former Tahidi High actor, Omosh, is trending after a video of him being prayed for by Pastor Kanyari at the latter's Salvation Healing Ministries Church went viral. In the video, Omosh is overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit while being prayed for by the controversial man of God in his church. He is then seen rolling down as he is surrounded by ushers. Actor Omosh then introduced himself and admitted that he was a sinner who wanted God to forgive him. "I have read about the altar and my things have not been working out well. I now think it is coz my connection with God is not okay. When I leave this place, I will start praying constantly." After the testimony, Pastor Kanyari asked the congregant if they know Omosh, and they all agreed that they knew him. "I did not want to pray for you. People pay tithe to be prayed for in my church but God has asked me to pay tithe for you and pray for you. I will bless you with some money. I will give you money for food and bless you with Sh 7k." Kanyari then told Omosh that the next time he visits the church, he would be the one to give and not be given. One of the congregants then walked to the pulpit with a shopping bag full of foodstuffs and handed it over to Omosho. Watch the video below: Omosh emotionally thanked the lady. "Oh my Gosh! God, you're a true God. Thank you so much bishop. God works in miraculous ways." Pastor Kanyari later removed the shopping from the bag, showing the congregation before placing his hand on Omosh's head and praying for him. The video comes a few days after Omosh disputed claims that he is back to using alcohol. This is after Kibe accused him of using cheap alcohol. "Mr. Kibe, this (pointing at the orange liquid) is my drink. Whatever you said, Konyagi ni yako. By the way, do you have Konyagi there? Us we don't take konyagi, we take something that's called juice."
