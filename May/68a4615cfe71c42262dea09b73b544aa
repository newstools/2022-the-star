Muslims in Kenya celebrated Eid-ul-Fitr which begins with the first sighting of the moon after a month of fasting. Eid-ul-Fitr translates to “the festival of breaking the fast”. Fasting is viewed as a demonstration of worship, which empowers Muslims to feel closer to God and reinforces their spiritual well being and self-control. Muslim faithful from all parts of the country converged today at their respective mosques to engage in prayers during Eid-ul-Fitr. Deputy President William Ruto and Raila Odinga have shared their best wishes to Muslims across the nation as they observe Eid-ul-Fitr. President Uhuru Kenyatta shared his message of goodwill too. “To all our Muslim brothers and sisters, as we mark the end of the Holy Month of Ramadhan today, it gives me great pleasure to send you this message of goodwill and best wishes as you celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr.’’ “Even though the Holy Month of Ramadhan has come to an end, I urge all Muslims to keep praying for the country as we head towards elections” he said. In many countries, Eid-ul-Fitr is a public holiday. Individuals celebrate it by sharing large meals among friends and family. If you wish to bid good tidings during Eid, the most effective way is to say 'Eid Mubarak'.
