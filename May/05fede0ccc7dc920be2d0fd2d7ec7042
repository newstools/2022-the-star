President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken on his deputy William Ruto head-on over the rising cost of living in the country. Speaking during the Labour Day celebrations at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday,  the President, without mentioning name, blasted his deputy for faulting him over the rising cost of living yet he is not the cause. The President said the DP and his allies have been misleading the nation about the true state of affairs regarding the economy. Uhuru blamed the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war for the rising cost of living, He said Covid led to a loss of jobs and affected many businesses in the economy. On the Russia-Ukraine war, Uhuru said it resulted in the rising cost of fuel exacerbating the Covid-19 effects. "It is not Kenyans who brought the Covid 19 pandemic that cost loss of lives and jobs. But even as we try to bring back order and revive the economy, others have begun wars that are completely out of nowhere." Uhuru noted that his government has done its best to correct the effects of the Covid and Ukraine wars. He, however, expressed his disappointment in the manner in which the DP and his allies have been handling the situation. "Instead of leaders coming together to sort the matter to see how we can solve the matter, they have begun inciting citizens. Am I the person who brought Covid? Did I cause the Russia-Ukraine war?" "Instead of coming to help me and offer your advice, you are busy in the market abusing people and you are calling yourself a leader of a higher rank. You should have left long ago I get some else to help me work."
