Royal Nairobi Golf and Nyanza Golf Clubs will this weekend play host to the ongoing ‘Road to Gleneagles’ Johnnie Walker Golf Series. This will mark the first double-header of the series. The Royal leg was earlier scheduled for May 29 but was postponed to this week, owing to the funeral and burial of former President Mwai Kibaki. The 17th and 18th legs of the Johnnie Walker series calendar have attracted over 300 golfers. The respective winners will join previous series event winners in the Eagles Round to be held on May 13 at the Muthaiga. The tournament will be played in a four-ball stableford format and golfers will be seeking to make a cut to the Grand Finale that will be played at the Karen Country Club on May 20. Here a fully-paid up trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland will be at stake. EABL Marketing Manager for Spirits, Josephine Katambo said the two events mark the final legs of the series that has been running since November 2021. She said after this weekend's events, they will close the series with both the semi-finals and the Grand Finale. "As a brand, we are very happy with the progress so far, especially in terms of the great number of golfers who have participated in the tournament," she noted. "As we head of Nyanza and Royal clubs, we expect a great display of talent from the golfers and we are excited about it. We look forward to yet another amazing tournament as it will also provide us with an opportunity to interact with our consumers in the two regions,” said Katambo. The event follows the 16th leg of the series played on April 23 at Kakamega Golf Club. In Kakamega,  Beatrice Shikuku led captain Rajinder Sembi, vice-captain Salime Amusala, and Viviane Amusala to victory after carding 105 points.
