Retired football superstar David Beckham is back in training after being signed up to the F45 fitness community by actor pal Mark Wahlberg. The former England captain visited one of the firm's studios in High Street Kensington, London and worked up a sweat alongside fellow members. He says: “I've been a fan of the F45 franchise and training model since being introduced by my friend, Mark Wahlberg. "Health and fitness have always been a big part of my life and, since my days playing football, I have always found I'm at my best when training as part of a team”. F45 focuses on fast-paced workouts lasting 45 minutes - meaning David and other members can easily fit a strenuous workout into a busy day.
