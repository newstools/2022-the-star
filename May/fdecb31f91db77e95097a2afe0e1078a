The girls won their final match by beating Tanzania 3-0 as Nancy Kawira beat Nasma Galawa 6-0 6-1 coupled with Seline Ahoya's 6-0 6-0 thrashing of Happy Daudi. Ahoya teamed up with Akoth to thrash Faith Njamakaya and Daudi by a similar scoreline. Owino said their next target is to play against players from other regions within the continent. "Going forward, we hope to get competition from other parts of the continent, to test ourselves against better players,” added Owino. The under 12 boys finished second behind Uganda. "We had good wins over Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda with Uganda the biggest challenge. We must devise a way of beating them come next year," observed Owino.
