Fresh from winning the Lisbon Half marathon, Kenneth Kiprop Renju has set his focus on next month's  Senior Africa Athletics Championships in Mauritius. The national 10,000m champion, who will be making his debut in the Kenya team, said his priority is to finish on the podium during the continental showpiece set for June 8-12 in Reduit city. Kiprop, also the winner of the Prague Half Marathon in February, earned a  slot in the Kenyan team to the Africa show after winning the 10,000m during the national championships-cum-trials. “My aim is to run my best and get good results. I am coming from road running and I have won so many of them. This time, I want to do something on the track,” he asserted. Trans Nzoia County native, who trains at the Kaptagat, will team up with Kip Keino Classic 10,000m champion Julius Kipkwony, who was second at the national trials, and former Olympic 10,000m  silver medallist Paul Tanui. “It has been a good season for me and I have had good results throughout. I started well this year and making the team was not easy. With this kind of opportunity,  I have to use it well,” he added. Last year, Kiprop closed the year with a win at the Baringo Half marathon when he won the 10km title in 30:13.05 after defending his 2020 title at 29:28. “I am a roadrunner as well as cross country and coming to the track, I want it to be successful too. This is a new venture and throughout my career, I always want to do my best,” he added. On April 2nd this year, Kiprop won the Prague half marathon in 59:29 beating compatriots Philemon Kiplimo (59:33) to second and Mathew Kipkorir Kimeli (59:46) where Kenyan runners scooped the top twelve positions. After winning the national title, he went ahead to register another victory at the Lisbon half after timing 60:03 beating Ethiopian Mohamed Esa (61:00) and compatriot Elvis Kipchoge Cheboi (61:03).
