Kikuyu Council of Elders has endorsed Narc Kenya Party leader Martha Karua for  Azimio la Umoja- One Kenya Alliance deputy presidential candidate. Speaking on Tuesday at their Ruaka offices, the elders led by KCE National Chair Wachira wa Kiago fronted Karua as the best candidate for the slot. "We will be very pleased as a community and as Azimio if we get Martha Karua as a running mate and later as the deputy president," Kiago said. KCE said they had to make the decision for the good of the community after assessing all other factors. "In every election,  we must play a role in determining leaders to be elected from the MCA seat to that of a Governor, Senator and even the Presidential position. Because if they slip, the country falls," he said. Kiago said the decision to back Karua was arrived at after intense consultations with various groups of Kikuyu elders across the country. "We were at the Coastal Region last weekend with over 800 elders from the Kiama Kiama and the Kikuyu Council of Elders where we deliberated on the elections matters," he said. The council lauded Azimio for establishing a panel to vet potential running mates saying the move was right in determining the best candidate. The Azimio running mate interviews started on Monday and are expected to be concluded on Tuesday. The panel is expected to submit three names of top candidates to Raila by Tuesday midnight for final decision making. Martha Karua faced the panel on Monday.
