Governor Ann Kananu has suspended the trading license of the Alchemist Bar in Westlands over allegations of racial discrimination against patrons and noise pollution. Kananu made this decision after a video that went viral showed the bar discriminating against the blacks. “I have directed county executive committee member for environment to institute a multiagency task force and a comprehensive report of the same to be made in the next five days,” Kananu said. The club located in Westlands has immediately been shut down. A reveler shared the video and alleged that blacks are not allowed to mix with whites and Indians at the high-end club. Nairobi City County Executive for Environment Larry Wambua confirmed about Kananu's orders. "We must protect our county which exercises immense respect to all social races and strongly stands against any form of discrimination and noisy pollution," Wambua said. The joint, in a statement, said that after consultations with Nairobi County Government, they have decided to close its doors to allow thorough investigations. "After careful consultations with Nairobi County Government, the Alchemist has agreed to close its doors while a thorough investigation is conducted over the next few days." On Monday, the club issued an apology and said that the management had reached out to the individuals who posted the video on social media to get more information on the incident. "To anyone that has felt aggrieved, we sincerely apologise and we look forward to sitting down together and addressing these issues head-on."
