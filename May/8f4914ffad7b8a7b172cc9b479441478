Deputy President William Ruto is in Eldoret for a church service at the PCEA Langas church before attending Kenya Kwanza campaign meetings in the Rift Valley region. Ruto is with UDA nominees in the region led by governor Jackson Mandago and others from the North Rift counties. From Langas, the DP will head to Nakuru county for a series of rallies. Another group of Kenya Kwanza leaders led by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi are in Kabarnet for similar rallies. A third group led by Ruto's running mate Rigathi Gachagua is in Kericho. All the teams will then converge for the rallies in Nakuru. Eldoret is Ruto's home region where Kenya Kwanza and UDA enjoy dominant support. His visit to the region comes amid debate over the high number of independent candidates vying against UDA nominees in the region.
