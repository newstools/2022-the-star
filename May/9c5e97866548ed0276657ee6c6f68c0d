Amira Sailors attacking midfielder Sherleen Nabifo believes players are responsible for their win-less run in the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Women’s Premier League thus far though they are working round the clock to turn around their lucklustre performance. The 24-year-old, who joined the Thomas Mucheni-tutored side at the start of the season from Orange Leonas, reckons that the team has enough quality and should be competing for the title. Sailors have registered a meagre three points from four matches and are yet to win. They sit at a lowly fifth position in the seven-team league. "Results have been unkind to us but we can't use that as an excuse. Sailors are blessed with attackers and midfielders who should shoulder the goal-scoring burden," she said. Sailors' expansive attacking approach was part of the reason Nabifo signed for the team despite burgeoning interest from Strathmore Scorpions and the University of Nairobi UON team. "My mind was made up and no enticing offer would have made me backtrack on my decision. I am enjoying the game here at Sailors. Being the youngest, there are no better players to look up to in the league than teammates Dominic Kremmer and Leah Omwandho. They are the league's creme de la creme. How they operate with the ball and the skillset they have is amazing," said Nabifo. She went on: "We have the best players and a system that should give us goals and wins. Conversions so far have been hard for us as a team despite putting up a good play. It’s something that we are also not happy about..but we are learning and trying to build from our previous matches. I believe Amira has all it takes to manage a podium finish." The Bishop Gatimu Girls alumnus developed an interest in the game while in Form Two. Losing to powerhouse Kerogoya Girls in the institution's maiden appearance at the regional level was tough luck but proved Nabifo was tailor-made for the captaincy. Prior to joining Leonas, she played for Multimedia University. .
