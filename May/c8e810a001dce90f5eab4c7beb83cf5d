The UDA senatorial aspirant in Vihiga county Jackson Swadi has dismissed rumours of being pushed out of the race. While speaking to the Star on phone, Swadi said he has been cleared by UDA. “There has been gossip going round that we have been forced to step down to leave room for other candidates; those are just fallacies,” Swadi said. He was reacting to the issue of party zoning which was to create room for strong parties within Kenya Kwanza Alliance to vie in Vihiga, a move that was not received well by many aspirants. Among the aspirants who have been cleared to contest include Jackline Mwenesi for Vihiga woman representative seat, Clement Sloya (Sabatia MP seat), Tom Atingo for Luanda MP seat, including MCAs. ​Swadi is set to face off Godfrey Osotsi (ODM), Kennedy Butiko (ANC), Babira Ndeda (PPK), Leo Ongadi, Sisco Mbindi and David Abwao, among others. He said if elected, he will ensure there is prudent use and utilisation of county resources. He urged those who are in support of devolution to elect Deputy President William Ruto as the next president. Devolved units have been allocated only 15 per cent of the total budget which caters for development, salaries and recurrent expenditures. “We need to elect a team that will defend devolution by allocating more funds for development,” Swadi said. He further urged his competitors to conduct mature politics devoid of insults and hate.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
