Google has given the Play Store a new fresh design overhaul on the web. This comes after saying it is going to make massive changes to the website version in November. The new design for the web has a close design to the mobile app. The updated design retains app previews, the ability to remotely install apps, and support for movies and books alongside apps and games. The new layout gives one a lot of white empty space, expanded onto a large screen but with a modernized look. There is also a new “Apps” tab that shows top charts, popular apps, and app filters. Users can filter the apps shown by device type including phone, tablet, TV, Chromebook, watch, and car. The install and search buttons are more prominent. The search icon is also visible on every page as Google no longer links to “Devices” when the Play Store sold hardware in the Nexus era. The design is already rolling out worldwide and some users are already seeing the changes on the play store website.
