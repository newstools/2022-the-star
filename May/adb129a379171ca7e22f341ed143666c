Kenya’s national carrier, Kenya Airways has announced that it will implement an exclusively cashless system effective 1st June 2022. This will be done at the Moi International Airport in Mombasa and the Kisumu International Airport. "The implementation of a cashless system helps to support the customer shift and preference to cashless transaction and will ease cash collection and reconciliation issues at the airports ensuring efficient services to customers," KQ said in a notice on Tuesday. Payments will now only be accepted through debit or credit cards and other online payment apps. Guests can choose from alternative payment options, including Credit/Debit cards (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, Union Pay) or M-pesa. In 2021, Kenya airways sought to eliminate person-to-person contact by introducing cashless transactions as part of the fight against the coronavirus. Chief commercial and customer experience officer for Kenya Airways, Julius Thairu, said the airline was encouraging customers to use mobile money payments, debit and credit cards to boost staff and passenger safety.
