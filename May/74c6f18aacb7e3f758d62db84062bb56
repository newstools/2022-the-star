The 86km stretch of the ongoing construction of the Kenol-Sagana-Marua dual carriage will boost the economy of  Kirinyaga county, Transport PS Paul Maringa said. Speaking on Saturday, Maringa said half of the Sh17 billion road will pass through Kirinyaga. The PS said the road will spur growth in the county due mushrooming infrastructural projects along the route. These include three additional markets, a trauma centre, a children’s  park and a vehicle inspection centre. “About 40km of the dual carriage will pass through our county. This means about Sh8.5 billion will be sunk into our county and spur growth," he said. Maringa, who hails from the county, spoke during a road inspection tour in various parts of Mwea and Kirinyaga central constituencies. He said the county was one of the biggest beneficiaries in roads under the Jubilee administration. He said 653km of road valued at Sh23 billion up from 53km in 2015 have been built in Kirinyaga. In Mwea, road construction shot from 4km to 256km, while in  Kirinyaga Central, 225km or roads have been built so far. "Sh9.5 billion and Sh9.3 billion has been utilised in Mwea and Kirinyaga Central respectively," he said. The added that contractors are back on site and enough funds have been allocated to ensure all ongoing road projects are completed in time. He urged residents to elect leaders wisely in the August 9 polls because their decisions may affect the continuity of projects. “Being an electioneering year, we want politicians to practice honest politics. We are also asking our people to be wise and avoid being duped by selfish politicians," Maringa said. “It takes three years to build a road, for the sake of continuity and completion of such projects we want a stable and focused leadership."
