Sweet plantains are simmered in rich and creamy peanut butter sauce. You can use ripe or raw plantains. I like using a mixture of both. Peanuts add an extra crunch to your sauce. Ingredients To serve: Preparation Step 1 Put oil in a cooking pan and over medium heat, add the onion. Sauté for about 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Step 2 Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Sauté until very fragrant, about 1 minute. Step 3 Stir in the broth, tomatoes, tomato paste and peanut butter. Raise the heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil. Stir in the chopped plantains. Step 4 Lower the heat and allow the mixture to simmer for 15-20 minutes, until it is thick and the plantains are soft. You can add a bit of water if it gets too thick during simmering. Step 5 Cook for 1-2 minutes more, until most of the liquid has evaporated. When the curry has finished simmering, remove the pan from heat and season it with salt to taste. Serve over rice and top with peanut.
