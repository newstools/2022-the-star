Raila said he will set up Special Processing Zones and expand international infrastructure to boost investment. He said his administration will equally deal with civil servants owning businesses that compete with the private sector. He was accompanied by his running mate Martha Karua to the meeting. Karua noted her commitment to ensuring all pending legal matters are addressed as well as forming policies that favour investors.
