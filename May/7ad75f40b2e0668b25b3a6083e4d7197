Bidco United head coach Anthony Akhulia has extolled his charges for exhibiting great character even as they crushed 1-0 to Ulinzi Stars at Thika Stadium on Saturday. Akhulia said the soldiers should thank their custodian, James Saruni, for protecting them from a thorough hiding. Masita Masuta's first-half strike was all the soldiers needed to secure the maximum points in the closely contested encounter. "We were simply unlucky not to have won this afternoon. We gave a good account of ourselves and created many chances only for Saruni to save Ulinzi from the lynching. “We are still struggling to find our footing this season but we are definitely burning the midnight oil to register positive results in the league," Akhulia said. His opposite number, Benjamin Nyangweso, was elated after his charges managed to break seven match winless jinx, adding that they would unleash every ammunition in their custody to gun down Posta Rangers in their next assignment. "This is an important win for us coming after a very long time. It will most certainly boost our morale ahead of our subsequent fixtures," Nyangweso said. Editing by Tony Mballa
