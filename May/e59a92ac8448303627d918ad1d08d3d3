Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula on Monday questioned the decision by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority to yet again close the Wilson Airport on Tuesday, Wetangula said the closure of the Airport is a big blow to the Kenyan economy that is on its deathbed. "Kenya Airports Authority must be called to order. Tomorrow May 31, 2022, they are closing our airspace for the 6th time in a month. Do they understand the damage they are causing to an already battered economy?" he asked in a Tweet. The Authority issued a notice on Monday scheduled closure of Wilson Airport between 1:30 pm and 7 pm. KCAA said the purpose of the closure is "operational sensitive information". It did not give a reason for the closure stating the motive as sensitive operational information. The Authority had closed Wilson Airport on Saturday to pave way for the Kenya Defence Force (KDF)Museum Air Show Festival.
