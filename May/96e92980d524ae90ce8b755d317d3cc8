A laboratory at Moi Girls High School in Eldoret has been destroyed after it caught fire last night. The cause of the fire is suspected to be an electrical fault. Firefighters from the Uasin Gishu county rushed to the school which is less than three kilometres away and battled the fire for more than three hours. Ainabkoi police boss Leonard Mate said they were still investigating the incident. The school administration and the police said no student or staff were injured in the incident. "Everyone is safe but the lab has been completely destroyed," Matete said. There were explosions during the inferno because of chemicals stored in the lab. Matete said the cost of the damage caused by the fire was estimated at more than Sh5 million. Matete said the fire started at about 11 pm last night.
