Germany will send Ukraine seven self-propelled howitzers, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht has said. The German government has come under pressure from European allies for being slow off the mark in providing Ukraine with weapons and it was only at the end of last month that it announced its first delivery, comprising Gepard tanks. Most of the heavy weapons Nato countries have sent to Ukraine so far are Soviet-built arms, but the US and some other allies have started to supply Kyiv with Western howitzers. The heavy artillery systems being sent to Ukraine are called Panzerhaubitze 2000, and the German military describes them as among the most modern in the world, so 20 Ukrainian soldiers will need to have training before they're sent. Germany only has a few dozen howitzers in a combat-ready state and the seven being sent to Ukraine will come from maintenance stock. Other developments in summary
