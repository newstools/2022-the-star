Kilifi governor and Pamoja African Alliance party leader Amason Kingi on Friday held delegates meeting at Karisa Maitha grounds on Friday. Kingi said he respects the Azimio  La Umoja One Kenya Alliance presidential flagbearer but noted the interests of the region come first. "I have not betrayed Raila. It is Raila who has betrayed the region. Kilifi delivered almost all the seats to ODM in 2017 but received not even a single nomination. I went to beg Raila to nominate the ODM campaign manager but he declined," Kingi said. Kingi who fell out with Raila after forming the PAA party dismissed Raila's statement that he (Raila) made him what he is today. Kingi defended his support to Deputy President William Ruto saying he is working with him because of the region. "In Ruto the future of the region is safe. In Raila the future of the region is bleak. I am a friend to Raila more than Ruto but this is not about friendship but the interests of the region," he said. He said that PAA is in Kenya Kwanza as a partner. "We have not joined UDA. We will field candidates in all positions except the presidency," he said.
