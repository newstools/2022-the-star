It's time to stand with Muslim community as they are part of Kenya’s society, Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo has said. Ottichilo who spoke on Monday while donating food to Muslims during the end of Ramadhan said the community has been ignored for long. “We have been working with Christian denominations to improve their places of worship and neglecting Muslims,” he said. The governor said it’s time we commit ourselves and help our brothers from the Muslim side. He said his administration will stand firm and help the Muslim community to improve their livelihood. “As the governor, I have been supporting them on small and petty issues. However, I am also going to focus on their social wellbeing,” Ottichilo said. The governor said they have never been in mosques for harambees but gone to churches for so many occasions. He said if re-elected, he will consider the Muslim community and champion their rights within Vihiga county. A section of the Imans who were present said Ottichilo has been on the front line, considering their events, ever since he became governor. The county boss further said the Islamic fraternity should keep praying for the nation as we head to election. The governor donated cooking oil, rice and wheat flour. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
