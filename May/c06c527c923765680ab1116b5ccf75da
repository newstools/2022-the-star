Azimio One Kenya Coalition presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga has urged Kilifi residents and the coast at large to punish Kilifi governor and Pamoja African Alliance party leader Amason Kingi for betraying him. Speaking in Kilifi and Chonyi on Thursday, Raila said he picked Kingi when he was fresh from University and led him through the political ranks to what he is today. The ODM leader termed Kingi as ungrateful and a leader who cannot be trusted. “I took him to Magarini when Harry Kombe, the MP then decided to desert me. I held his hand and told the residents that he was the best replacement for Kombe. He was elected as MP. In 2013 I took him across the county and he was elected as governor for two terms," Raila said. "I made him minister in different ministries but he has given me a donkey’s kick. Please pay him by kicking him and his party out of this region." Raila said that before Kingi formed his party he went to him and he advised him against ditching him but he went ahead and registered the party. “He came to me when I was with Junet and governor Joho. I asked him to stay but after a few months he said he has formed his own party,” he added He termed him as egocentric for always thinking about his welfare and not the public. “He is now eyeing the senate speaker seat which is nothing. He will not even get it because he will not meet the conditions set by Kenya Kwanza. Kingi has been cornered because he will not get the 50 percent votes condition given by Ruto." Mombasa governor Hassan Joho dismissed Kingi as insane. He said it was shocking to see him ditch the party after building it “Who does that? You toil to build a house and once you finish building the house you leave it to start another,” said Joho He was accompanied by Cotu boss Francis Atwoli, Peter Kenneth, Suleiman Shahbal and other Kilifi leaders.
