Gospel singer Ben Cyco has paid tribute to his late sister Joy. Joy died in 2020 after battling cancer. Ben penned an emotional message to celebrate a life well lived. "Continue resting, my sister. I’ll always love and remember you," he wrote. Ben Cyco and his wife Wanjiru recently talked about the impact her death had on them on their podcast, JoyRide. "I just saw how her sickness affected you in those two years she was sick," she said. "I felt if something like death happened, me and you wouldn't survive." Ben said God's grace helped him overcome the loss. "I thought the grief would crash you and that you would become a shell of yourself. How I thought you would react and how you reacted is very different," Wanjiru said.
