Shujaa have been placed in a tricky Pool 'B' for the London Sevens, where they face Ireland, Argentina, and South Africa this weekend. Following a dismal performance in Toulouse, where they picked up one point, Damian McGrath's charges will open their campaign against the flying Irish. Ireland reached the final in Toulouse before losing to Fiji. Shujaa will, thereafter, take on Argentina who top the overall standings before tackling Blitzbokke in their final pool match and 'African derby'. Fiji headline Pool 'A' alongside the USA, Spain and Wales while Pool 'C' looks like the pool of death with France, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada fighting it out. Pool 'D' will see Samoa, England, Scotland, and Japan battle it out. The top two teams in each pool will qualify for the Main Cup quarter-finals. Shujaa won only one match in the three-day of competition in the South of France last weekend. They beat Wales 19-15 and lost 29-5 to Fiji, and 38-14 to France in the pool stage to drop into the classification category. Kenya then lost to Scotland 24-12 and bowed out of the tournament with a loss to Japan 28-12 in the 13th position playoff match. Despite poor performance in the tournament, Bush Mwale and Billy Odhiambo were among the top six ranked performers in the tournament. Mwale was ranked third behind DHL Impact Player of the tournament Terry Kennedy of Ireland who had 66 points and USA’s Kevon Williams who managed 55 points.  Mwale managed 54 points after six tackles, two-line breaks, 10 offloads, and 22 carries in the three-day tournament. Lucas Lacamp of the USA and Billy Odhiambo were tied on 52 points each. Odhiambo had five tackles, three line breaks, six offloads and 26 carries. He is ranked sixth overall on the 2022 World 7s Series Impact players list with 272 points following 52 tackles, 14 line breaks, 23 offloads, and 132 carries in this campaign. France’s Paulin Riva closes the top six with 50 points. Pilipo Bukayaro (Fiji), Luciano Gonzalez ( Argentina), and Joachim Trouabal of France are in the top 10. Standings: Argentina 118, South Africa 116, Australia 110, Fiji 87 France 81, USA 80, England 63, Spain 43, and Samoa 41
