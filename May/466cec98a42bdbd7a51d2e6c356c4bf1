Needy students from Nyamira who excelled in the 2021 KCPE exams will receive full Elimu scholarships from the Equity Bank Foundation. Fifty five applicants will benefit from the programme. They were prioritised due to the merit of their cases, being total or partial orphans and bright but needy. Equity Bank Nyamira branch manager Robert Abere said the programme will help the students to allow them to have equal academic opportunities with others from able families. “Education is an equaliser and that is why we have come up with this programme to ensure that every bright but needy student gets an opportunity to continue with their education,” Abere said. He spoke during the programme launch in Nyamira on Monday. Nyamira health executive Gladys Momanyi urged the learners to be watchful of groups that could ruin their lives and concentrate on changing their backgrounds. “Do not let anyone disrupt your academic journey. Think big and know where you have come from and the main purpose of your academic journey,” Momanyi said. The scholarship will include full school fees, uniforms, books, shopping and pocket money with transport every term from the learners’ homes to the Equity bank branch and to their various schools. The learners will be getting their allowances from the Equity Bank branch in Nyamira. “It is now a requirement that every learner who is being sponsored by the programme have an account where the bank will be depositing their allowances," Abere said. “The learners will be able to access their monies after they close schools through the accounts provided by the banks via ATM cards.” The learners will be also required to report to the branch every time the school closes for performance monitoring, guidance and counselling that will be provided by the bank staff.
