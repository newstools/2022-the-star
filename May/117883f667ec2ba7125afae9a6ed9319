Nzoia Sugar head coach Salim Babu has chided his charges for displaying complacency in their Kenyan Premier League clash against Sofapaka at Kasarani Annex on Sunday. Babu was upset after their opponents rallied from a goal down to beat them 2-1 in the closely contested encounter. "This is the worst display I have witnessed so far since I took charge of the team. We had a concentration lapse and relaxed a bit after netting our goal. Hopefully, we shall be able to right the wrongs and bounce back in our next fixture,” Babu said. James Kibande fired the visitors into the lead from the spot in the 66th minute after he was sent tumbling down in the area by Fredrick Odhiambo. However, a quick reaction on the opposite end paid off handsomely when Rody Manga tapped in from close range to restore parity two minutes later. Then, as Manga charged forward for a brace moments later he was brought down, forcing centre referee Zachariah Ashira to award a penalty which Lawrence Juma gladly hurled into the net in the 71st minute. Sofapaka completed the proceedings with 10 men after skipper Lawrence Juma was sent for an early shower in the 72nd minute following a nasty tackle. Editing by Tony Mballa
