The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on Sunday started receiving nomination papers and clearing candidates for all elective positions. This exercise, which runs to June 6, marks the start of the official campaign period. Aspirants on various party tickets and independents will now formally become candidates. All the candidates sign up to subscribe to the electoral code of conduct in the Elections Act. It clearly spells out the dos and don'ts. Candidates should strictly observe it as any breach forms a basis for an election petition. Those who contravene the code are liable to various penalties. Its highlights include not engaging in violence and avoiding use of hate speech, language or any kind of action that may lead to violence or intimidation. It also bars candidates from engaging in bribery and distribution of non-offensive election material or literature. Plagiarising the symbols, colours or acronyms of other parties and the removal, disfigurement or destruction of political campaign materials of any party are also offences under the code. The code of conduct further bars candidates from abusing a position of power, be it state or traditional authority, for political purposes, including any offer of reward or threat of penalty. If enforced, the code will level the playing field for all candidates and facilitate a free and fair election. The IEBC must therefore enforce the code to the letter, without fear or favour.
