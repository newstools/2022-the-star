The 2016 African Championship javelin silver medalist Alexander Kiprotich says he is relying a lot on videos from the internet to sharpen himself ahead of the Senior Africa Athletics Championships in Mauritius. Kiprotich said his training took a huge hit from the coronavirus pandemic and subsequently, has been training alone. "If I could receive scholarship, that would aid me a lot in my training.  I've been training by myself for a while now... sometimes using videos from the internet. The African championship is my first-ever international appearance since 2019 so I want to do well," he said. Kiprotich added that the African showpiece is part of a larger dream of competing at the World Championships in Oregon in July. "When I go there, I will try to qualify for the World Championships because there is that opportunity. The good thing is that the weather in Mauritius is warm, which is very conducive for javelin. Hopefully, I can improve in my training and get there in top shape, technique and coordination," he said. However, the 2013 African Junior champion concedes he will be under pressure to perform on his first international competition in three years. "The pressure is certainly there because I have been away for a long time. I will also be competing among great athletes so there is need to be on top of my game. I don't want to get ahead of myself but to take it step-by-step as I work hard to reach peak condition," Kiprotich said. He added: "From my assessment, my technique is not so bad. It just needs a bit of sharpening. That's why I am on the lookout for any opportunity to train outside so as to improve as I should." Kiprotich is also hoping to compete at one of the Diamond League legs as part of his competitive engagements in 2022.
