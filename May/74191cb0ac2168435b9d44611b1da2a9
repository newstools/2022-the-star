The Israeli army killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in cold blood. The journalist earned wide-spread praise of two decades of reporting of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. She was shot in the head as she covered Israel's latest raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
