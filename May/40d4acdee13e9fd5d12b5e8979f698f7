Secondary schools in Arid and Semi-Arid areas will receive at least 962 classrooms in a new government initiative. Early Learning and Basic Education PS Julius Jwan said the plan aims at improving student learning in secondary schools and one hundred per cent transition. Jwan was speaking during the joint mission of the Secondary Education Quality Improvement Project (SEQIP) at the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology (CEMASTEA) in Karen. "The classrooms to be built in 561 secondary schools in 30 counties in ASAL and marginalized areas, will be ready in December," Jwan said. Jwan thanked the World Bank for the support it has given the government in enhancing retention and quality education in the country. SEQIP targets 7,852 primary schools and 2,147 secondary schools in 110 sub-counties in the 30 counties. A total of 859 laboratories will be built in 785 schools and 1,843 eight-door sanitation facilities in 1,783 primary schools. One door in each of the schools will be for Special Needs Education (SNE). Officials will conduct a two-day assessment of the status of the implementation of the project on Thursday and Friday in five of the counties benefiting from the project. Members of the joint mission comprise officials from the World Bank, Ministries of Education, and the National Treasury. Officials present included KICD CEO Charles Ong’ondo, Director of Project Coordination, Elijah Mungai, World Bank Senior Education Specialist Ruth Charo, and Director CEMASTEA Jacinta  Agatha.
