Former Mother-in-Law actress Jackie Matubia was afraid she could lose her contracts with clients after the unplanned second pregnancy. Speaking on her YouTube channel, Matubia said she learnt she was expectant at eight weeks. "That day I wasn’t feeling well. I even thought I had contracted Covid-19," she said. "I had no appetite, and his cologne was irritating me. I was at a point where I never thought I could be pregnant again." Matubia was tested for different things, among them pregnancy. "Between my last period and the time of conception, when I was getting pregnant, I was on family planning — an injection," she said. "The doctor told me I was eight weeks pregnant, I froze. I did not know whether to laugh, cry or shout. This second pregnancy, I wasn’t ready because our relationship was just in the ‘honeymoon’ period." Matubia added that she was taking time for her man before they thought of getting another child. "I went to the car and cried for 30 minutes. I then called Blessing (Madiba) over the phone and he was very excited," she said. Matubia said she was afraid her contracts would be terminated. "I used to cry because I did not know if my contracts with different companies would be terminated," she said. "I felt like I was gonna lose all the sources of my income, it was hard." Matubia is expecting her second baby with actor Blessing Lung'aho, alias Madiba.
