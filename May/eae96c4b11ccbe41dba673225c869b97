Sauti Sol says it is dealing with theft after presidential candidate Raila Odinga's coalition used their song without consent. The boy band lost 2K YouTube subscribers on Tuesday. It had 905k YouTube subscribers on Tuesday night and 903k subscribers on Wednesday morning. The band suffered the loss a day after they threatened to sue Azimio la Umoja for using their 'Extravaganza' song without consent. 'Extravaganza' was played during an event in which Azimio unveiled Martha Karua as Raila’s running mate on Monday. The band said the act of Azimio using their song without consent is blatant copyright infringement as directed by section 35, CAP 170 of the Copyright Act of Kenya. Speaking to Word Is, Bien said using someone’s intellectual property without their consent is stealing. ODM party said they played Sauti Sol's song during the occasion since they appreciate their work. They acknowledged that the band is a celebrated team and that was a way of appreciating their music. "The group has carried our country’s flag so high in international fora and every Kenyan appreciates this." Bien took to Instagram to respond to fans who attacked them. "I'm reading comments on Twitter," he wrote. "Our education system is failing us. Too many ignorant keyboard warriors. The same guys stealing from us will steal from you." He added that they will never back down from doing what is right and distanced themselves from taking any political side.
