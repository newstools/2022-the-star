The National Government Administration Officers (NGAO) in Laikipia County have recovered a machine gun which was stolen in October 2021. The machine was stolen from the security forces after a fierce gunfight with bandits. The weapon, a CQ machine gun, was handed over to an assistant chief after a series of community policing and engagements with the public. While handing over the weapon to Ol Moran Police Station, Kirima Deputy County Commissioner John Orata lauded the public for cooperation and support towards ending cattle rustling and banditry in the area. The county was in September last year declared a security zone following a surge in bandit attacks that have left many residents displaced and others dead. The heavily armed attackers are notorious for intimidating local ranch owners and stealing their livestock. Last week, a multi-agency team conducting a security operation in Marsabit County reported that it recovered an assortment of weapons and ammunition during a raid in Marsabit Central. "During the operation, three AK 47 rifles, one G3 rifle and a General Purpose Machine Gun were recovered." The operation team also recovered an assortment of 579 rounds of ammunition, 66 spent cartridges and containers of gun oil. NPS had launched the 'Rudisha Amani Marsabit' operation, following a streak of indiscriminate attacks by bandits on the public. NPS said that the curfew imposed in the County remains in place. "We continue to encourage the voluntary surrender of firearms," Orata said.
