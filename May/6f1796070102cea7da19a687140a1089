Garissa Township MP Aden Duale has called on President Uhuru Kenyatta to appoint the secretary to the cabinet saying time is running out. Duale said the assumption of the office of the President Act No. 21 of 2012 stipulates that the leadership of the committee is to be headed by the secretary to the cabinet. It also establishes and constitutes the assumption of the office of the presidential committee. The committee is mandated under the provision of Section 6 to facilitate handing over the process by the outgoing president to the president-elect and the provision of the security detail and briefings among other key functions. He said the President has failed to appoint the officeholder since 2014, saying Kenyans should be worried. Duale spoke on Saturday at NEP Girls High School when launched the Sh40,220,000 annual Garissa Township NG-CDF bursary scheme for the FY 2021/2022. In 2014, the President forwarded the name of Monica Juma to the House for vetting and subsequent approval. However, she was rejected and since then no other name has been forwarded. “The President is breaking the law, which is very wrong,” he said. He said a person nominated for the position of the secretary to the cabinet must be approved by the House by article 154 and considering that the House is set to break in less than four weeks. According to Duale if this is not done, the assumption process for the next president-elect may be jeopardised. Duale also took time to drum up support for the deputy president and the UDA party saying they form the next government. He emphasised the need for the committee to be in place on time.
