A General Service Unit officer escaped death narrowly after he was attacked by thugs on Thursday night. The GSU officer, in the company of two women, was walking from Mihang’o trading centre to the paramilitary training camp when the assailants struck. In a tweet, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said that following the attack, the two women escaped, leaving the officer to square it out with the two thugs. The officer managed to fight off the assailants before fleeing the scene. He was later rushed to Ruai hospital for treatment after he reported the matter to his colleagues. "Preliminary investigations indicate that the thugs had earlier staged two separate attacks in Embakasi and Njiru, where they robbed innocent Kenyans of their mobile phones, cash and other valuables," DCI said. Detectives based in Njiru have since launched a manhunt for the suspects.
