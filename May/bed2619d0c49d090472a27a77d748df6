The 2022 Asian Games, also known as XIX Asiad, are a multi-sport event. Before the postponement, Hangzhou would have become the third Chinese city to host the Asian Games, after Beijing in 1990 and Guangzhou in 2010. The games had been scheduled to take place from September 10 to 25, 2022. No reason was given for the delay, but China is battling a resurgence of Covid cases. The organizers said in a statement on Friday that new dates for the sporting contest will be announced at a later date.
