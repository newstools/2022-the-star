With the rugby season on a break, event organizer Ali Mbaraka said the tournament’s theme was to bring people together during this national electioneering period. “Our target is to have peaceful elections come next month. We must use sports to promote coexistence in the country,” said Mbaraka. Besides the political angle, the tournament is meant to promote the sports in a region, which has not had good rugby for long. “We have very good talent in this region but we lack avenues to promote it to a higher level. Such tournaments are very critical for the players as we use them to prepare for the next season,” he added. In the semifinals, the champions defeated The University of Eldoret Trojans while Wazalendo beat Moi University side, Arsonists.
