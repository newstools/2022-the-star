Media personality Anita Nderu has imported her baby's clothing. Anita, who is expecting her first child with her husband Barret, told her fans she is shipping nursery things for her baby. "Our baby's first few months' items have arrived, and I'm kind of emotional," she wrote on Instagram. She enjoyed redecorating and researching and shopping online for all the things they needed. "This feels so final for some reason," she wrote. "Not the wardrobe, though! Peanut's wardrobe will be like her mummy's. It will always be a work in progress. Maybe I'll find another room to decorate to pass time." Socialite Vera Sidika also imported most of her daughter's essentials from the UK. Her daughter's bed cost her Sh300,000.
