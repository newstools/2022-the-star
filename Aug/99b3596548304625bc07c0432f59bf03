Singer Ivlyn Mutua has made a return to the gospel fraternity. The artist switched from gospel to secular music in 2019, then terminated her contract with her music label two years ago and submitted to mentorship. "God has fully restored me into His Kingdom, the Kingdom of Light, so that I may serve Him Forever for His Glory," she wrote. "I'm no longer signed under #TaurusMusik. Actually, I terminated my contract year later, that's in May 2020 to be exact." Ivlyn told Word Is she made the decision to reach out to people who cannot talk about Jesus. "I am a contemporary artiste who will be singing about everything and not just Jesus," she said. Ivlyn said interacting with secular artistes was hard and her perspective about some of them was totally different.
