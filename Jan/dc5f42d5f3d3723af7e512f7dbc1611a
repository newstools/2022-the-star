The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development has released a new list of English Literature and Kiswahili Fasihi set books that will be examined from 2022 to 2026. This means students in Form 2 are to begin reading the selected set of literature and fasihi books. Most English set books are new while the Swahili Fasihi enters the second year as they were introduced in 2021. In letter dated January 7, 2022, the institute said that the new set books will replace literature books that have been in use since 2017. The set books serve a cycle of five examinable years. "The new texts are replacing those that have been in place since 2017 as per the circular MOE/QAS/5/19/16. The duration of the study of set books is five years," the circular reads. The circular is titled 'Approved Secondary Literature in English and Fasihi ya Kiswahili Set Books for 2022-2026.' Paul Vitta's "Fathers of Nations" published by Oxford University Press replaces Henry ole Kulet's "Blosooms of the Savannah" as the compulsory novel. In the English optional books, "Artists of the Floating World" will replace John Steinbeck's "The Pearl." The book is written by Kazuo Ishiguro and published by Longhorn. "A Silent Song and Other Stories" replaces Chris Wanjala's the "Memories We Lost" in the anthology of short stories genre as optional set book. The short stories are edited by Kenya's literature guru Godwin Siundu and published by Spotlight Publishers. In Fasihi, Pauline Kea's Kigogo is now replaced by Bembea written by Timothy Moriasi in the play category [Tamthilia] while Nguu za Jodi makes it to the novel category replacing Asumpta Matei's Chozi la Heri. On the other hand, Mapambazuko ya Machweo na Hadithi Nyingine published by Mountain Top publishers takes the place of Tumbo lisiloshiba in the short stories genre. (edited by Amol Awuor)
