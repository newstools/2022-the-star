Former Attorney general Charles Njonjo’s body has been cremated in a private ceremony attended by family members. His interment comes barely five hours after he passed on. Njonjo’s body arrived at the Kariokor crematorium at 9.30 am accompanied by about 25 family members. The cremation was preceded by a brief service by the family. The media and non-relatives were not allowed access. All the family members have already left the crematorium. The former minister's death was announced on Sunday by President Uhuru Kenyatta who said Njonjo's death is big blow to the country. The President prayed for comfort to the family and friends of Njonjo whom he described as a national hero, as they go through this difficult period. The passing away of Hon. Njonjo is a big blow not only to his immediate family, friends and relatives but to all Kenyans and indeed, the entire African continent because of his leading role in the founding of the Kenyan nation at independence," Uhuru said. "As a nation, we owe a debt of gratitude to Hon. Njonjo and his generation of independence era leaders for their selfless contribution to the laying of the solid foundation upon which our country continues to thrive." Njonjo was the only surviving member of Kenya's independence cabinet.
