The National Sevens circuit will return with the George Mwangi Kabeberi Sevens on May 7-8 after a two-year hiatus. The popular six-leg tournament was temporarily put off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Christie Sevens will be played on May 14-15 at RFUEA grounds with the Kakamega Sevens set for May 28-29. The Driftwood Sevens is slated for Mombasa Club on June 4-5. The circuit will then take a two-week break before resuming with the Dala Sevens on June 18-19 and the Prinsloo Sevens in Nakuru a week later, the final installment of what is expected to be a competitive series. Kenya Rugby Union chairman Oduor Gangla was delighted to have the seven series back and the union has started looking for sponsors for the circuit. "We have started looking for sponsors and the clubs and players will be delighted to have the Sevens Series back after two years and judging by recent history, it's going to be competitive,” added Gangla. KCB won the 2019 edition after amassing 119 points following wins at four stages of the six legs on offer — Kakamega, Dala, Christie and Driftwood. Mwamba finished second with 92 points and two tournament wins — at the Kabeberi and Prinsloo Sevens. Homeboyz finished third with 92 points with Nakuru a further two points behind. Impala completed the top five with 81. Elsewhere, Strathmore Leos are set to miss the services of centre Shem Okola, who underwent an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) surgery following an injury picked during Saturday's 19-7 loss to Menengai Oilers at Strathmore Complex in Madaraka. The club revealed that a successful surgery was done to fix the player’s broken tibia. ORIF surgery is used for serious fractures that can’t be treated with a cast or splint. These injuries are usually fractures that are displaced, unstable or those that involve the joint.
