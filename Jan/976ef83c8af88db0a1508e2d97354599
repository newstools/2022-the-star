Mandera Senator Mohamed Mohamud on Thursday declared that he will be vying for the governor seat. Late last year, Mohamud’s Furkesha subclan of the Garre clan endorsed Feisal Abdirahman as the community’s sole gubernatorial candidate. Mohamud who was present at the function accepted the elders verdict and promised to abide by it, however he has now rescinded his decision saying that it was due to demand from his supporters to contest. The Garre community forms the majority in Mandera and is made up of four major subclans namely Ali, Adola, Asare and Furkesha. Incumbent Governor Ali Roba hails from the Ali subclan which is the largest. Other clans are the Murules and Degodias.

I started out as a civil engineer, then served as resident engineer. I was privileged to be appointed Kenyan ambassador to Egypt with accreditation to Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Eritrea,” he said. He added:  “Thereafter, I served as a permanent secretary in the ministries of regional development, home affairs and roads and public works,” “I now offer myself as a gubernatorial candidate for Mandera. I have the experience, competence and requisite network among the communities in Mandera,” he said. Senator Muhamud will now battle it out with Mohamud Adan khalif and Hassan Noor from Asare clan.
