Former Sports CS Rashid Echesa has dismissed claims that the System will not allow their camp to form the next government. A System is a term used in Kenya to refer to a cabal of influential government officials who have the ability to influence major decision making in the economy and politics. He claimed that the so-called system in the government was hugely dominated by the people who were chased from the government by president Uhuru Kenyatta. "Rais wewe sikiliza bwana, sisi ndio tulikua system hapo ndani na tumetoka na hiyo system (Listen Mr. President, we were the system in your government and we left).” “…where was your system when your victory was nullified by former Chief Justice David Maraga? Where was the system when you used to call us at the State House for the way forward?" he posed. Echesa spoke on Friday during a UDA, ANC and Ford Kenya mega rally in Bungoma County. Echesa further claimed that the president favoured the Nyanza region in development projects and sidelined their region. “We have nothing personal with our brothers in Nyanza, but developments should have been equally distributed," he said In June last year, ODM leader Raila Odinga defended projects implemented in the Nyanza region saying Nyanza like any other region deserves development. “Odinga finds such talk retrogressive, divisive, dishonest and against the spirit of building one prosperous nation out of its diverse nationalities and regions,” Raila said in a statement by his spokesman Denis Onyango. Raila also said the era of setting up communities against one another was long gone. “Odinga appeals to leaders to enable and allow Kenyans to imagine an ideal future and hold big dreams for their country instead of standing in their way,” the statement by Onyango added. Echesa was fired in March 2019 by the president when he reshuffled his cabinet. The Ruto ally blamed Raila for being behind his dismissal from the government. Edited by B. Marita
