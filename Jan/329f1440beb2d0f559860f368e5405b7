The long-drawn savage war between the Pokot, the Marakwet, the Turkanas and the Tugen is spiraling out of control in a country that pretends to place a high premium on law and order. In the past one week, seven people have been gunned down in a deliberate cold-blooded campaign for hegemonic control of large swathes of the countryside by an ethnic army hiding behind cattle rustling as a social-cultural phenomena and commercial enterprise. We have a contingent of soldiers in Somalia, but ordinary folk in Marakwet are shot at will like deer every passing day. They live in fear in a country whose politicians and technocrats are long on promises and hopeless at delivery. The ragtag thugs rule Marakwet confident no one will come for them because they enjoy the protection of muttonheaded politicians incapable of thinking beyond their tribes. The Kenyatta administration handed out guns to police reservists in 2013 and the senseless killings abated until 2016, when ill-advised bureaucrats reversed the order and started a disarmament campaign. The net effect was the balance of power that kept aggressors off knowing the people they targeted were equally armed disappeared and emboldened the blood-thirsty politicians behind the never ending killings. Interior CS Fred Matiang’i is a man who takes his job seriously. We beseech him to arm all the parties in the conflict equally through the well-established police reserve service and let county commissioners and the police bring an end to this ruinous war.
