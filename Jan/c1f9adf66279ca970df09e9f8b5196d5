Eight people died after the matatu they were travelling in rammed into a stationary lorry on the Webuye-Eldoret highway on Sunday morning. Police said there were no survivors. The accident occurred a few minutes past 5am in Musembe, Lugari. Those who died were seven adults and a child. The 14-seater matatu belongs to 2NK Shuttle that plies the Bungoma-Nairobi route. Police said it had eight people on board. Western regional police commander Perris Kimani said investigations into the cause of the accident are ongoing. “It is like the driver panicked on seeing a stationary lorry and tried to swerve but the lorry ripped off the roof and the metal decapitated all the occupants,” Kimani said. The driver of the lorry, Nicholas Mwangi, said he had stopped behind another trailer that had stalled on the road when the matatu crashed into his lorry. “I saw a truck that had stalled and because I know the driver, I stopped behind it. But moments after I alighted and placed the warning signs on the road, I heard a bang. The roof of the matatu was torn,” he said. Mwangi was travelling to Mombasa from Uganda. The bodies of the accident victims were moved to Webuye Subcounty Hospital mortuary. Dorcas Ilamwenya, who lives near the scene of the accident, said she heard a loud bang and when she rushed out, she saw the roof of the matatu had been ripped off. Jackson Ananda said he heard a bang and assumed it was a tyre burst. “I rushed out and what I saw was appalling. The matatu’s roof had been ripped off completely. It’s not a good sight as the New Year begins,” he said. Pastor Mark Museve of the Pillar of Hope Church said they were in church for overnight prayers when they heard a huge blast. He said he rushed to the scene and called the police to inform them of the accident. “We are begging drivers to be careful on the road as people return to their places of work after the New Year celebrations and schools are about to reopen,” he said.
