Deputy President William Ruto  has said Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka should join him in his bid to build the next government. Ruto said Kalonzo shares similar Christian values as him therefore making him the best fit to work with. ..."Huyu ndugu yangu Kalonzo, sababu yeye anaamini Mungu kama mimi, si tushikane ndio tungeneze hio serikali ingine ya mwaka ujao," Ruto said. Loosely translated as (My brother Kalonzo belives in God like I do, shouldn't we join hands and build the next government). The DP spoke on Saturday while in Makueni County where he marketed his bottom-up economic model. He also said his major rival in the State House race ODM party Raila Odinga has not done any development for the people of Makueni. "Mimi nlimsukuma mpaka akakua Prime minister. Nikafanya Uhuru akakua Rais. Mimi sina shida na mtu. Nmesema mara hii wacha nisaidie mahustlers," the DP said. Meanwhile, Raila today took his campaigns to Narok county ahead of the August elections.
