Mojito is the epitome of a refreshing cocktail. It is a bubbly rum-infused cocktail that marries well with other fruits. It has tones of sweet yet minty and sparkling taste. A classic mojito is essentially the base cocktail for several fruitier variations such as the passion or garden mojito. And as with most great rum drinks, Mojito’s origin is known to be from Havana, Cuba. The best part is you can basically muddle in any fruit of your choice and curate a cocktail flavour of your choice. The club soda added stretches out the flavour of the cocktail to give it a soft fizz. As with most cocktails, it’s easy to prepare and doesn’t require a lot of ingredients. And you can play with the ingredients to suit your taste buds. Ingredients Method Stir, garnish with mint leaves and enjoy
