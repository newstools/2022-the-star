Last month, the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) announced a new maize purchasing price of Sh3,000 for a 90kg bag. Joseph Kimote, NCPB managing director, said the board was purchasing the maize for its commercial function and that all farmers within regions that are currently harvesting or have already harvested were encouraged to deliver their grain to the nearest NCPB depot. The middlemen flooded the region to buy the produce following the announcement by the NCPB. But some regions are not reporting a drop in maize prices, while some record a sharp increase.
