Contrary to popular belief, scotch eggs are not from Scotland. They're actually a traditional British dish consisting of a hard-boiled egg (that has been shelled) wrapped in sausage, covered in breadcrumbs, and then deep-fried until crispy. However, they were not originally covered in sausage meat in the beginning but in a rich, creamy fish paste then sprinkled with breadcrumbs. Ingredients Method Place eggs in a sufuria then fill it with water until they are fully covered. Boil oil over medium heat for about 15 minutes. As the eggs boil, in a bowl, remove the casing from the packed sausages and put the meat in a bowl. Add crushed garlic, salt, black pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt and red chilli. Using a spatula/fork mix all the ingredients. Add in cheddar cheese and mix again. Note: If it's too sticky, drizzle a bit of flour on the sausage meat and mix well. Remove the eggs and let them cool for a while, then peel off the shells. Scoop a tablespoon of the sausage meat, pat your hands with a bit of flour, and knead the meat slowly with your hands, squeezing it flat with your hands then laying the egg on top of the meat. Cover the egg with the meat then roll it slowly until the sausage meat completely covers the egg. Note: for a crunchier feel at the top double dredge. After you have worked on all the eggs, mix one cup of breadcrumbs with half a cup of flour in one of the bowls, put the beaten egg in another, then lastly, put in half a cup of breadcrumbs in another bowl. Dredge the egg in the flour and breadcrumb mixture, roll it then dip it in the beaten egg then dredge it again in the bowl with the breadcrumbs and roll. Place a saucepan with oil halfway filled on medium heat, and place the eggs. Turn them as they cook, to cook evenly. Let the eggs cook until they are golden brown and appear crispy at the top. Set them aside in a tray covered with kitchen towels to cool and drip off excess oil. Garnish, serve and enjoy.
