As ODM leader Raila Odinga marked his 77th birthday at the Bomas of Kenya, one thing that stood out is the cake he shared with those present. Interestingly, the cake had five layers, with the top most bearing Raila's image on top, and the words '2022 and beyond' on the side. The Star has established that the cake was not just the usual cake, and every layer had a special meaning behind it. Now, Raila is seeking to become the fifth President of Kenya in the August 9, General Election. If elected, this will make him the first President from outside Central Kenya and the Rift Valley regions. The first layer of the cake was labeled 1964 - 1978 symbolising the time the founding father of Kenya, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta led the country. Jomo Kenyatta died in his sleep in 1978, paving way for Daniel Arap Moi who was the Vice President at the time to act as President for three months before an election was held, which he won to become the country's second president. His tenure was labeled on the second layer of the cake, 1978 - 2002. Moi ruled for 24 years before he retired. The third layer was written 2002 - 2013 indicating the tenure of retired President Mwai Kibaki, who completed his two terms. The fourth layer, 2013 - 2022 indicated the tenure of President Uhuru Kenyatta that ends in August 2022. The topmost layer which also had Raila's image, symbolised his tenure as the fifth President of Kenya, if elected on August 9. The layer was labeled 2022 and beyond to show that he is the incoming president beginning 2022. The Kenyan Constitution only allows a president to serve for two terms and retire. Other than the symbolic cake, Raila's birthday was also celebrated across the counties with several cutting cakes in public. The cakes were labeled 'Raila the 5th'.  Edited by CM
