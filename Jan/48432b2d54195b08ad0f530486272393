Deputy President William Ruto was on Friday received with cheers upon arriving in the Western region. The DP was accompanied by his two allies from the region ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangula. He was also accompanied by more than 50 MPs, a host of MCAs and aspirants. Ruto said the key agenda to unite the country is not for the benefit of leaders but to tackle the challenges facing our nation. "Through our unity, we will take our country back to the progressive path. This is our opportunity to put ordinary Kenyans in the driver's seat of our economy," Ruto said.
