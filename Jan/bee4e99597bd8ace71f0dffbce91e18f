Churchill Show comedian Jasper Muthomi, alias Mc Jessy, will be vying for Imenti South parliamentary seat on a UDA party ticket. The comedian confirmed on Wednesday that he has officially joined DP William Ruto-led party after wider consultations. MC Jessy said the DP called him and invited him to the UDA party. "It’s now clear where the vision is heading. After many days of consultative meetings with my South Imenti people, I have officially been invited to join UDA," he said. He added that he could not resist joining UDA because it is where his people want him to belong. "The groundwork that has been done has finally landed on the side of the winning team. When I got the call from the chief Hustler Inviting me, I had to heed my People’s call and his call to join the winning Team. And may the work of redefining South Imenti Now begin," he added. Another person from the entertainment field who is in UDA is singer Ruftone. He is eyeing the Nairobi senatorial seat.
