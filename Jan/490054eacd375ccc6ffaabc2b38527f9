UDA has accused Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi of being too slow in taking action against perpetrators of Sunday's violence at deputy president William Ruto's rally in Jacaranda, Nairobi. Secretary-general Veronica Maina said Matiangi had turned a blind eye to the chaos because he supports ODM leader Raila Odinga's presidential bid. The party is accusing ODM of instigating the violence that was witnessed at the event. "Matiangi has publicly supported Raila. We are asking him to take off the political hat and save Kenyans from political intolerance. His ministry has remained silent on the matter but has acted very swiftly in other incidences," Maina said. She said UDA will be writing to Inspector General of Police Hilary Mutyambai demanding a report on the progress of investigations if there is any that has been done. Former Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama dismissed claims by ODM that UDA was behind the violence to win the sympathy of the city voters. "It is very clear that ODM orchestrated the violence. We had no reason to do that to our supporters," he added.
