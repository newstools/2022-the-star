Kenya's top-ranked junior Angela Okutoyi will play at a warm-up tournament in Melbourne ahead of the Junior Australian Open in the same city. The teen sensation, who leaves the country on Saturday, will have five days to acclimatise to the hot and warm conditions expected in Australia's most populous city. Speaking Tuesday, Okutoyi's coach Thuku Rogoi said the teen sensation has trained well and she is relishing the challenge of playing in the first major grand slam tournament of her career. “We had good preparations towards the end of last month and having played quite extensively last year we are ready for the task ahead,” he noted The warm-up tournament serves off on January 14 with the Junior Australian Open set to concurrently with the Australian Open starting January 17. Rogoi said Okutoyi will be targeting to win at least two matches to boost her chances of playing in future junior grand slam tournaments including the French and US Open later in the year. “As a coach, I have told her to enjoy the moment and avoid unnecessary pressure, ” Rogoi noted. Okutoyi has played at the ITF Training Centre in Bujumbura since age 11 before relocating to Nairobi three years ago and moving to Casablanca in Morocco last year. Rogoi believes the experience will be a big boost, especially at the grand slam Junior tournaments. "Her experience between 2011-2021 has been a journey and it will aid in her push to move up the rankings,” said Rogoi. Okutoyi, currently ranked at 142, is expected to play in an ITF junior tournament in Italy in February and the Africa Junior Championship in Tunisia in March.
