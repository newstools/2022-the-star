Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has ordered motorists to surrender all red Kenya Garage (KG) number plates by April 1. In a statement on Friday, the CS announced that the red KG plates will be replaced with Container Freight Stations (KC), Kenya Towing (KT) and the green KG plates. "All the Containers Freight Stations dealing in motor vehicles and towing services providers must surrender the red KG plates and replace them with digital green KC plates and KT plates, respectively by April 31," he said. He said that the government had established an Inter-Agency Team drawn from transport and security to validate all the motor vehicle/motorcycle dealers, manufacturers, repairers of motor vehicles, and tow truck owners. The team recommended a digital register of all motor vehicle dealership in the country, among other things. All the dealers who qualify will be issued with digital licensing cards, and the existing licenses will be revoked at the expiry of the period. “Existing plates will be rendered obsolete at the expiry of the period,” he said. The CS said that registration and management of motor vehicles’ records are critical in facilitating legal ownership and documentation of the relevant transactions. He added that the exercise also impacts the economy and the nation's security.
