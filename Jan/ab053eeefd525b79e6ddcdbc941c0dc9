Youths under the ‘Vijana na Rao’ banner have urged fellow youths in five Maa counties to support Raila Odinga’s presidential bid. The youths said Raila’s development record in various capacities speaks for itself and the country is safe in his hands. Led by the chairman Eduardo Githaiga, they said the handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila brought unity, cohesion and peace. “We are rallying all the young people in Narok, Samburu, Laikipia, Baringo and Kajiado to support him. He is best-placed to bring change and the only hope for a better future,” Githaiga said. They spoke to journalists in Narok town Secretary Hezena Lemaletian said they will traverse the five counties to ensure they vote as a block and take Raila to Statehouse. “We will leave no stone unturned. We will ensure we put our votes in one basket,” she said. Lemaletian commended the President for putting up infrastructure first, saying the country needs a development minded leader to continue with his legacy. “Raila is an engineer by profession and has a history of development. It is only prudent for the youth, to vote him in office,” Lemaletian said. Allan Ming’ati, Narok North constituency aspirant, said Odinga has stood with the Maa people even when he was in opposition; he helped protect the environment. “We will not leave Raila now that he needs us because he stood with us even in our weakest points. As young people, we will stand with him,” Ming’ati said. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
