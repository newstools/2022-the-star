It’s still mango season and I’m here to rescue you if you think you’ve experienced all there is and are feeling tired of this wholesome juicy fruit. A slushy is a frozen drink made with crushed ice and sweet, fruit pulp or fruit flavoured syrup. The beauty of this slushy is, it can be served either as breakfast, a snack or dessert. Its taste is a blend of sweetness with a minty burst. It is a treat that you can make on any occasion and it's not time-consuming at all. Aside from its amazing taste, this slushy is very nutritious. Kiwi is high in vitamin C content, fibre and antioxidants while mangoes are low in calories and loaded with vitamins like vitamin A, B6 and E. Ingredients 1 - 3 centimetres fresh ginger Method Note: The more ice you add the more like a sorbet this will become. If you don’t want to use ice cubes, then the use of frozen fruits is an excellent alternative. Freeze your fruits (while peeled and cubed) preferably 24 hours before you begin preparation. You can add syrup or sugar if you're a sweet tooth although added sugar interferes with the original sweetness and flavour of the fruits Simple and yet incredibly tasty. Enjoy.
