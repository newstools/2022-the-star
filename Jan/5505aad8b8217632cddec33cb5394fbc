The inaugural Kenya Airways cargo flight to Europe set to depart Saturday evening from the Kisumu International Airport. Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) in their Twitter handle stated "We are excited as plans to start airlifting fresh produce from Kisumu International Airport have been finalised. Kenya Airways is set to airlift 1.8 tonnes of dress green chili to the outside world. A farmer Balminder Sokhi, who is running a 4 hectares of land under chili in Siaya county harvested his chili on Friday, for placement at the Peche Foods cold rooms, which is located in close proximity of Kisumu International Airport before the flight. Kisumu Lakefront Development Corporation chairman Edward Ouko had earlier on said that farmers in the lake region, including fishermen, will benefit immensely through the new development. “This step is very important for the region’s economy and development,” he said. Ouko noted that they want to ensure all the products that will be leaving the airport are quality assured and secured. "We will also ensure the products are in line with all government instructions and particularly, that of the importers." Farmers are expected to venture into value addition and fish processing to tap into existing markets locally and internationally. Among the commodities earmarked for export from the airport include avocado, fish, chili pepper and mangoes. Others are pineapples, peanuts, traditional green vegetables and organic beef. Last year, the national government allocated Sh1.2 billion to expand Kisumu International Airport. The airport has been expanded to encompass a cargo handling and cold storage facility through a public-private partnership.  Edited by B. Oruta
