Railways Golf Club will host the ongoing Johnnie Walker Golf Series, marking the return of the series following the festive season break. This will be the fifth event of the series’ calendar with over 100 golfers expected to participate. Action at the 9-hole, par 72 golf course will start at 7.00 am and will be played in the competition’s four-ball Stableford format. The top three winning teams from the competition will book their slots to play in the competition’s Eagles Round. Here, they will seek to make the cut to play in the Series’ Grand Finale, whose ultimate prize will be a fully paid trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland. So far, 12 teams have already qualified to play in the next round following the events held at VetLab Sports Club, Thika Greens, Windsor, and Nakuru. Kenya Breweries Limited’s marketing manager for spirits, Josephine Katambo said: “We are very delighted to be back for the Johnnie Walker Golf Series following the Christmas break and we look forward to having the series at Railways, particularly given the long and special relationship KBL has with the club." "We are glad that participation has been very positive so far and we hope going forward, more golfers will come on board. "This being the first event we are having this year, we expect to be treated to a very exciting event on this iconic course as golfers aim to make the cut for the next round,” said Katambo. The Johnnie Walker Golf Series dubbed ‘Road to Gleneagles’ is the latest move by KBL to leverage sport to create avenues for positive interaction with customers of their brands.
