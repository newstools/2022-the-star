The battle for Bungoma governor's seat has continued to attract more aspirants after businessman Zacharia Baraza on Monday declared he will run on the UDA ticket. He said he had decided to join UDA because it is the only party with grassroots support. Baraza is set to square it out with incumbent Wycliffe Wangamati, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka and Kibabii University dons Peter Khakina and Sophy Waliaula in the August polls. Lusaka and Wangamati have not yet disclosed their parties of choice. Baraza was received by UDA Bungoma county chairman and Sirisia MP John Waluke at Bungoma Members Club. Waluke was accompanied by MPs Mwambu Mabonga (Bumula) and Webuye West's Dan Wanyama. Baraza said UDA will produce the next president in August. He said after carrying out research for over six months, he settled on UDA as the party that county voters identify with. Baraza, also a human rights activist, said he has held consultative meetings with different groups in the county and has arrived at a party that is popular and will propel him to power in August. "I have chosen UDA as the main vehicle that I will use as I seek to be the third governor of Bungoma," he said. Baraza has been instrumental in initiating development projects in Bungoma. "I have constructed roads in rural areas, I have participated in harambees and paid school fees out of my pocket," he said. Waluke said the county has had two governors and the third one will be Baraza. "We need to realise change and development in Bungoma, let's support Baraza," he said. Mabonga asked Baraza to continue supporting the party. "UDA is the frontrunner, you have high chances of beating other gubernatorial candidates. You have made the right choice," the lawmaker said. Wanyama said Baraza had joined UDA after learning that it carries the aspirations he wants. "He has followed the right path, he has seen the light, let others follow suit and join it," he said.
