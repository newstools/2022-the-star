Former Masinde Murilo University of Science and Technology (MMUST) winger Tyson Juma has quit rugby to venture into athletics after incurring a head injury. Juma, 23, suffered a head depression injury during the KRU Championship semifinals against Mean Machine in 2019 after helping MMUST qualify for the Kenya Cup. Juma, who also played for Shamas Foundation Rugby is keen to emulate Africa 100m record holder, Ferdinand Omanyala, who also quit rugby for athletics. “I started running while in primary school at Ober Boys and continued with the sport Ringa Secondary School. When I got the injury, I decided to quit athletics for rugby because I didn’t want to risk my life again considering rugby is a physical and contact game,” he said. Juma, also a former national under-20 rugby player, was a top scorer in the three seasons he played rugby. He finished second and third respectively in 100m and 200m during the Kenya National Inter Universities games held at Kibabii University in Bungoma in December. “That was my first competition and with intense training, I’m sure I will perform better. I’m looking forward to the Athletics Kenya track and field weekend in Nairobi in February where I expect to face off with my role model Omanyala and other big boys,” noted the Disaster Management student. Juma added: “I sometimes train with Omanyala and I’m confident I will do well in sprints. My dream is to represent Kenya at World Athletics Championships and Olympics.” Juma is also a dog breeder. “I do dog breeding as a side hustle and a hobby,” added Juma. Ends
