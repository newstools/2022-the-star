Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru has said that it will an honour, if she would be picked as Deputy President William Ruto's running mate ahead of the August elections. Speaking on Tuesday, Waiguru said that the decision will solely depend on the deputy president, but her main focus is to serve the people of Kirinyaga. "I think it's a great honour to be picked as running mate for the UDA party but right now, all my efforts are on Kirinyaga county," she said on Spice FM. "In the discussion of the choice of who should be running mate, I'm not a party to such conversation but what I know is that decision of who will be running mate is the decision of one William Samoei Ruto." Waiguru noted that their only concern is the issue of where Ruto's running mate will come from, but the agreement they have so far is that he or she will come from the Mt Kenya region. She said that is because of the region's strength in numbers when it comes to voting. "We all know the numbers that come from there, we look at the support he is getting. Politics is a game of numbers." Waiguru is highly seen as one of the favorites to be picked by Ruto as his number two, alongside Mathira MP, Rigathi Gachagua, among others. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, who has declared his presidential bid, is among key figures that have previously been mentioned as possible running mates for the DP. Nearly all leading presidential candidates, including ODM leader Raila Odinga, are considering picking a running mate from the Mt Kenya region.
