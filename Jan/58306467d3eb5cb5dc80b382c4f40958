Officials in Mombasa are on high alert over the influx of fake Covid-19 certificates in the region. County public health chief officer Pauline Oginga on Thursday said unscrupulous individuals are issuing fake Covid-19 certificates to residents. "We therefore wish to notify residents that genuine Covid-19 certificates can only be obtained when you actually get vaccinated in an authorised health facility or outreach camp,” she said. Oginga said any other place that is not authorised and purporting to be vaccinating or issuing certificates is illegal. “We are weeding out those certificates and legal measures will be taken against those who issued and those who received them,” she said. Oginga urged those in possession of fake certificates to present them to the nearest health facility for verification. “We will use them to track the source,” she said. Mombasa county was given a target of vaccinating 402,000 people. So far, more than 292,000 people have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine with only 95,598 people having received their second dose. In a report issued by the health department on Thursday, Mombasa county has vaccinated 113,412 people with the AstraZeneca vaccine out of which 61,638 have received their second dose. The Moderna dose has been administered to 40,461 people out of which 29,343 have received their second dose. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine has so far been administered to 37,238 people.
