Kenya has suspended all inbound and transit passenger flights from the United Arabs Emirates for seven days. The suspension took effect on January 10, for an initial period of seven days. "Inbound and transit passenger flights from UAE are suspended for a period of seven days. We are doing this to reciprocate a ban on Kenyan passenger flights to UAE," Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said. The ban will not affect cargo flights which will continue with normal operations. Last year, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority temporarily suspended all air transport services with inbound and transit passenger movements from Kenya. DCAA said customers will not be accepted for travel on Emirates flights in Nairobi during this time. Outbound passenger operations from Dubai to Nairobi remain unaffected. "Affected customers do not need to call us immediately for rebooking. Customers can simply hold on to their Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with their travel agent or booking office to make new travel plans," DCAA said.
