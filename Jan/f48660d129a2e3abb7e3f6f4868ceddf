A Nairobi court on Monday deferred the sentencing of a student who started a fire that led to the death of 10 of her colleagues at Moi Girls School, Nairobi, in 2017, until January 14. This is after the probation officer told Milimani deputy registrar Jane Kamau that a report on the girl was not ready. Kamau directed the case be mentioned on January 14 to confirm if the probation officer’s report is ready. The student, who is now 18 years old, was in December last year found guilty of manslaughter by Justice Stella Mutuku. The judge was not sitting on Monday. At the time of the incident, the accused was a minor aged 14 years. She was housed in Kabarnet dormitory, where the inferno occurred. The girl has been remanded at Langata Women's Prison. In convicting her, Justice Mutuku said the accused did not start the fire with the intention of killing her schoolmates, but did so in a desperate attempt to get transferred from the school by any means. "Her aim may have been just to cause a fire and burn the building without hurting anyone, but it was ill intentioned, given that the building had two floors and there were going to be casualties as a result of the fire," she said. The judge said the accused in her naivety may have overlooked the consequences of her actions. Her attempt to wake some of her friends up was aimed at rescuing them from the fire. The judge said the prosecution, having failed to prove the element of malice aforethought, was unable to find the accused guilty of the offence of murder. The judge found the accused not guilty of the offence of murder in all 10 counts she is facing. "She is hereby acquitted of the 10 counts of murder she is facing. Instead, I find the offence proved beyond reasonable doubt to be manslaughter in all the 10 counts." On September 1, 2017, Kabarnet dormitory was gutted by an inferno that left 10 of the students who had just reported back to school dead and their families grieving the loss of their daughters.
