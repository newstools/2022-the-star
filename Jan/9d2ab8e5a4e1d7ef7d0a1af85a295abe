Three months ago, Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici was among the critics of ODM leader Raila Odinga. Who would have thought that one day, Ngirici would be wishing Raila a happy birthday, no less a day before the actual event. However, as the saying goes, there are no permanent enemies in politics. Raila will be celebrating his 77th birthday on Friday, January 7, 2022. On Thursday, Ngirici was among leaders who took a head start in wishing the ODM leader a happy birthday. “Happy 77th birthday Jakom,” Ngirici posted on her Facebook account. Ngirici was a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto until late last year when she was irked by the DP’s move to welcome her rival Governor Anne Waiguru to UDA. Ngirici has expressed interest in Kirinyaga governor seat in the August election and will be seeking to battle it out with the incumbent Waiguru who has served her first term. Recently, the MP said that she will be vying as an Independent-Candidate, but there is speculation that she might join the handshake team as Jubilee and ODM seek to form a coalition. The Woman Rep swiftly changed her comment about the votes of the Mt Kenya people, saying that the people can either choose to vote for Ruto or Raila. Earlier this week, Ngirici wiped out all signs, colours, and symbols associated with the party from all her campaign material. Her Kerugoya-based private office gate wall has been repainted in white and black. The office was previously branded with the party's yellow, and green colours, a wheelbarrow, and inscribed with the party’s slogan. The office was designated as the county’s party headquarters. Her campaign truck, mini-vehicles, and sound system truck which were all heavily branded with UDA campaign posters have also been peeled off.  Edited by CM
