Diamond Platnumz is releasing an EP and an album. The Tanzanian singer announced this on Instagram, saying his album will be a 12-track project. "51 songs on my album folder, while all I needed was just 12 songs for the album," he wrote. Adding, "I think I'll release an EP before my 12 lucky songs album." Diamond released his last album in 2018, titled, 'A Boy From Tandale'. He has, however, not given more details on the names of the two projects or when exactly they will be released in the course of the year. Meanwhile, his longtime rival Alikiba has announced he is also releasing another album this year. He dropped his 'Only One King' album in 2021.
