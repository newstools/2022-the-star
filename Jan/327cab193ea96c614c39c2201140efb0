American TV presenter Steve Harvey has promised to adopt Kenyan comedian Elsa Majimbo as his niece. The renowned presenter hosted Elsa in his Steve on Watch Show, where the 20-year-old shared how her comedy journey started. Elsa says she did not dream of being a comedian, nor is she considered funny by her family members. "Most people from Africa do not follow their dreams because there is a certain path that has been laid for them. I am glad I am doing what I am doing because I get to show dark skin girls that they can also be successful," she told Steve Harvey. The presenter encouraged Elsa to pursue her dreams regardless of the negative energy she comes across. "I want you to stand your ground and be strong coz there is only one you," Steve advised Elsa. Steve Harvey then announced that he will adopt Elsa as his niece so that he can help her mould her career. "This is what I am going to do to you...I am going to adopt you as my niece, I will give you my phone number ... I don't care what you need, I am going to give you what you need. You need a place to go...some help...some advice...you wanna talk to somebody... you call me. I am serious and I don't wanna let nothing happen to you," he said. "One of my main goals has been to bridge the gap between Africa and African-Americans. Elsa, you got an uncle in the United States...anytime you need something, I got you." Born in Kenya, Comedian Elsa Majimbo moved to South Africa then to the United States of America where she currently resides. She recently started a podcast named Bedtime with Elsa.
