Grammy Award-winning star Burna Boy has apologised to his fans for what he termed stooping so low that he exchanged words with Ghanaian artiste Shatta Wale. "I'm sorry everyone. I don't do this type of ***sh, fighting a pig will only leave you dirty, the pig is used to dirt," he wrote on Instagram. "I really let this pig get to me. But I promise, this is the last time I will ever allow myself to stoop to this level. "I sincerely apologise to everyone. I will not be seeing social media at all this year. I'm out. See you all in real life." His message comes after he and Wale exchanged bitter words on social media. It all started when Wale threw shade at Nigerian artistes then Burna Boy challenged the rapper to a one-on-one duel. In response, Wale wrote that he was ready. "Let's do this Accra Sports Stadium. I just call shots, you be man. Don't come sing your song, let's do freestyle!" Burna Boy then responded that he didn't want a rap battle but a physical fight. “It’s a fist battle like the type real men do. We can do it anywhere you want; behind closed doors or in stadium for the world to see," he wrote. “Fool wants to come and sing rubbish. I’m tryna see your teeth and blood on the floor, boy. You talking about singing.” Burna Boy apologised after he included Wale's mother in their beef. “Remember my mother doesn’t control my career. I run my own shit street way," he wrote. “So if your mother dey watch you diss me today and she go forgot I saved your a** up when police was all over you in Naija. No wonder I don’t know your father. “I don’t think you really got father training. You are hiding your father from everyone because you said you don’t want people to know he is a fitter."
