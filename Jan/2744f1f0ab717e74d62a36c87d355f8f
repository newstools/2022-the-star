Kiambu governor James Nyoro has said the Mount Kenya region will vote for ODM boss Raila Odinga almost to the last man. The governor said the region will not accept divisive leaders but will instead elect Raila as a stabilising factor in the country. He said the more than 1000 leaders who met Raila earlier at the Mount Kenya University will be his ambassadors in spreading the Azimio La Umoja gospel. " Nobody should now even doubt the ability of former prime minister Raila Odinga in ascending to the presidency," Nyoro said. The governor who is hosting Raila in his Kiambu turf for the launch of the ODM boss' presidential campaigns, said time is ripe for a Raila presidency. "Baba has climbed the mountain and now he is at the peak, he has proved wrong all the doubting Thomases," the governor said. Nyoro spoke as Raila made a grand entry into Thika Stadium where he is due to address a mega rally and launch his August 9 presidential bid. Raila is accompanied by a host of political leaders from the Mount Kenya region and at least six governors. The former prime minister has just concluded leaders meeting with politicians from the Mount Kenya region at the Mount Kenya University. Some of the leaders present include governors James Nyoro(Kiambu), Nderiti Muriithi(Laikipia), Hassan Joho(Mombasa) and Francis Kimemia of Nyandarua. Other governors include James Ongwae(Kisii), Anyang Ngong'o of Kisumu and Cyprian Awiti of Homa Bay,  Nakuru governor Lee kinyanjui, Kajiado's Joseph Ole Lenku, Siaya's Cornel Rasanga, Kakamega's Wycliffe Oparanya, Embu's Martin Wambora among others. -Edited by B.
