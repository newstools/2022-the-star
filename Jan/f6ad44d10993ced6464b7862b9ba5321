ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday welcomed a delegation of Rift Valley leaders to his Aziumio La Umoja movement. The team included Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar, Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) of Livestock and fisheries Linah Jebii Kilimo Linah Chebii Kilimo, former MP Aldai Mp Sally Kosgey and former police IG David Kimaiyo. The leaders met Raila at Chungwa House office in Nairobi. Senator Kamar had already announced that she will be vying for the Uasin Gishu governor seat in the August 9 polls. Kimaiyo on the other hand is eyeing the Elgeyo Marakwet senator seat. Earlier in the day, ODM's director of communications Philip Etale had said they were set to receive new entrants into the party. "Today we shall receive more into the party. And we shall continue growing," he said. The Rift leaders were joined by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos. Tolgos has been candid in his support for the ODM leader after he fell out with deputy president William Ruto. Kamar on the other hand has been leaning on the Handshake team ever since the DP's relationship with the President went south. Other leaders present during their welcoming to Azimio include Governors Ali Hassan Joho (Mombasa) and Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru). Suna East MP Junet Mohamed was present. The MP took to social media shared the above picture and said: "Inawezekana". Edited by B. Marita
