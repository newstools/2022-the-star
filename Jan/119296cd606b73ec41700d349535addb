Citizen TV's longest-serving presenter Kambua Manundu has left the station after 12 years working for them. The singer, who had been hosting the Sunday morning show, 'Rauka', delivered the news to her fans and followers on her last show today. Giving her last speech at the station, she thanked her fans for standing with her for the entire journey she has been through. She praised every fan for their encouragement, loving her and cheering her on. "I would like to take a bow and hang my boots and say kwaheri to all of you who have allowed me to come into your homes for 12 good years," she said. "I have come into your homes through you know just gospel Sunday and just the whole journey that it has been over those years. Thank you so much for loving me, for encouraging me, for cheering me on, for allowing me to speak into your lives as well." She, however, did not reveal her next move. Kambua hosted the show alongside singer Timeless Noel, who wished her well. "It won’t be the same without you, but we’ll do our best to make sure we carry on the work you’ve poured into this place. All the Best K, I'll miss you."
