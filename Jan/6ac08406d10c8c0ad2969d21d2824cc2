The government will deal firmly with anyone found cuplable of having written the contentious letter that agitated for the removal of Harambee Starlets from the Africa Women Cup of Nations qualifiers. In a terse statement released on Saturday, Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed reiterated government's commitment towards the team's Awcon campaign. Amina was emphatic that nobody would be allowed to derail the team's mission, which has been a big success thus far. “We have learnt that there is a suspected fraudulent letter that was purportedly written to Caf to withdraw our heroines, Harambee Starlets, from the Africa Women Cup of Nations [Awcon] qualifier against Uganda,” read the statement in part. “The Harambee Starlets have worked so hard to get to the last hurdle to the Awcon finals in Morocco later in the year and any attempt to interfere with that must be condemned and not be allowed to succeed. “Anyone found to have been involved in any such attempt will be held fully accountable,” the statement warned. Harambee Starlets are already in camp preparing for the first leg in Kampala, Uganda, on February 17 and the return leg in Nairobi five days later. Amina said they had allocated sufficient resources to support the noble cause. “As Ministry of Sports, Culture and Heritage, we have mobilised every resource under the guidance of the FKF Caretaker Committee led by Justice [Rtd] Aaron Ringera to ensure Harambee Starlets are ready for the fixture against Uganda,” Amina continued. The CS Saif they were on constant communication with the relevant bodies to unlock the stalemate. “The Ministry is doing everything possible to contact the relevant authorities at the Confederation of African Football [Caf] and the world football body, Fifa. Harambee Starlets will continue with their preparations as we seek to correct this misrepresentation.”
