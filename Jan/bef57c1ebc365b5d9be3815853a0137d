A 23-year-old man who was kidnapped on Tuesday morning  in a suspected frame-up has been rescued by detectives. During the rescue mission, three suspects were also arrested. They include; Dickson Mwendwa, 24, Robert Kioko, 23 and Philip Kilonzi, 28 years. According to police report, the victim had travelled from Mwingi East to Githurai to visit a couple who came from the same rural area, only to arrive  and find the woman of the house alone. As the two chatted, the alleged husband stormed in accompanied by three other men, who landed on the young man with blows and kicks on allegation of having a romantic affair with the wife. In a statement via Twitter, Director of Criminal Investigation George KInoti said the three men frisked the victim taking Sh5,000 from him, before hurling him out of the house and whisking him away to the empty room. "The victim was forced to contact his family members to raise the Sh300,000 ransom, threatening dire consequences if they failed to comply," Kinoti said in the statement. "Sleuths who got the report from the victim's father rigorously trailed the suspects to the scene, casting an ambush that netted three of them." The victim who had been stripped naked and injured on the face was rescued to safety, as the three were taken to custody. "As detectives probe further to establish the crux of the incidence, the suspects are pending arraignment for their crime," Kinoti said.
