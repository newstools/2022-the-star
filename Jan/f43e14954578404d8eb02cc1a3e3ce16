YouTuber Milly Chebby says she nearly walked out on comedian Terence Creative. Milly celebrated her 35th birthday this week  and Terence promised her five gifts. The first was renewing her ring that he bought her five years ago. Terence asked if Milly regretted dating him, to which she responded saying she almost left years ago. "Now I don't regret marrying you or dating you, before...yes," she said. "There were years I actually wanted to leave. You were not a dreamer, you didn't care anything about life. You used to tell me you have been raised in poverty, money is not a problem." The comedian further asked her what made her stay in the relationship, which has lasted 10 years. "I never used to blame you. I used to blame your upbringing. You were never brought up in a family set-up. I knew there is something in you that if it was ignited would blow," Milly said. In the past, the mother of one opened up saying she wanted to dump Terence after he cheated on her.
