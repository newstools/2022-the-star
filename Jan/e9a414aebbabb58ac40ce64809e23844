The European Union and IFAD have invested Sh35.3 million in food security, livelihoods support and climate change mitigation projects in Kitui. Six earth dam projects aimed at cushioning 32,000 most vulnerable community members and over 54,000 livestock are being built. The county National Drought Management coordinator Francis Koma said his department was implementing the projects through the support by the donors. Koma, who spoke to journalists in Kitui town on Monday, said last week he visited the six earth dams and was impressed that all but one had harvested substantive volumes of water from the October-December short rains. “Although they might not have filled to capacity, at least the communities have got some water,” Koma said. The six earth dames projects include Mbarani in Mumoni ward, Kaveta in Ikanaga ward, Kilimboni in Kyamatu ward, Ikakaani dam in Kanyangi ward, Kililuni in Chuluni ward and Ngengi in Kyuso ward. “Residents will use the water to address issues of climate change, for example, growing irrigated drought tolerant crops, pasture conservation, tree nursery establishments and environment conservation,” he said. Koma said the projects were not imposed on residents as they were picked through a participatory approach in which community members identifies the challenges they faced and suggested remedies.
