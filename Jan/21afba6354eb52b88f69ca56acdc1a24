Kiambu governor James Nyoro has revisited the political symbolism of Kiambu county saying it has always heralded a new dawn for the country. The governor said that founding president Jomo Kenyatta held his final rally before the colonial power declared a state of emergency in 1954 in the county. "Kiambu is not an ordinary place, this is a historic county that has set history," he said at the Kiambu stadium. Speaking during a campaign rally organised for ODM boss Raila Odinga, Nyoro said the fact that the ODM boss is launching his presidential bid means that he is headed to State House. "You are not in Kiambu by accident, this first meeting you are holding here will take you to State House," Nyoro told Raila. He went on: "Now start the journey for the presidency," he told Raila. The governor said Kiambu is significant in the country's political landscape because Kanu was launched in the county. "It was here that Jomo Kenyatta was made president of Kanu, Jaramogi Oginga vice and Tom Mboya secretary-general," Nyoro added. He also said the county often offered political refuge for multi-party democracy crusaders from the Moi regime clampdown. "When James Orengo and Paul Muite were fighting for the second liberation they used to come here when they were being chased away from Kamukunji grounds in Nairobi," he said. At the same time, Nyoro asked voters in Kiambu not to transfer their votes outside the region for fear of any violence in the August 9 General Election. "We are the real reflection of this country, over 45 per cent of the people living here come from other regions," he said. He went on: "We have said that this is your home and feel at home. From tomorrow start registering as voters because we are a rainbow county and we want those who stay elsewhere to feel at home." -Edited B. Marita
