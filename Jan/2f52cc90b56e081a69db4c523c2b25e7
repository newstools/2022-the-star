If you have watched the popular Netflix series of Emily in Paris, you will definitely fall in love with the cast’s fashion sense. The show, which recently came out with its second season and has already announced two more seasons stars, Lily J. Collins, as Emily, an American marketing professional who is in Paris for a year. She works in a luxury marketing firm ‘Savoir’and also dresses the part. Styled by legendary stylist Patricia Field and costume designer Marylin Fitoussi, Emily’s fashion is not only dramatic but also weirdly colourful, and hyper-feminine. So let’s take a look at some of Lily Collins’ dramatic outfits from Emily in Paris. Above all, it was the polka-dotted, ruffled, bright red tulle dresses in Season 2 that contributed massively to the sartorial impact that the show’s widely-debated wardrobe had. But that’s not all.  Going monochrome in yellow, Emily wears a strapless mini dress from Self-Portrait topped by a similarly-toned blazer from Zara in this scene Camille's father accidentally chops his finger off  She wears all the primary colors at once, leaning into her color of choice: yellow. Accessories include her ever-present beret, hoop earrings, a Prada bag and Seymoure gloves from the brand’s collaboration with Patricia Fields. Going for contrasting colors, Emily rocks a pink striped polo top and green printed mini skirt bottom, anchored by a statement green belt. Mixing prints like a pro, Emily slips into a checkerboard top from Zara, a multi printed mini skirt, knee-high purple boots from Maison Skorpios, and a printed chain bag.
