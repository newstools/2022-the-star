Choreographer Aggie the Dancequeen is yet to stop dancing, making complex steps and movements despite being in her third trimester. To Aggie, dancing is not only a hobby but a profession that she enjoys partaking in. Speaking to Word Is, Aggie said she wants to overcome stereotypes that pregnancy prevents one from keeping up with their normal routine, more so, doing vigorous exercises, such as dancing. The choreographer, who rose to fame after featuring in the Short and Sweet video by Nyashinski and Sauti Sol, is still dancing in heels despite being seven months pregnant. "I was scared after hearing stereotypes that I should not engage in vigorous activities after four months, but I just couldn't help it. I toned down at around the sixth to seventh month. Right now, I do a few stretches in the house,” she said. Aggie owes her flexible body to a fitness routine that she has developed in her dancing career. "If you build your body for long, it stays flexible for long. I think I am okay because I have done exercises for long. I love dancing in heels, it strengthens my body, I am yet to stop it.” Having dated for eight years, Aggie says she had not planned to have a child with her boyfriend, choreographer Oscar Mwalo. "This pregnancy was not planned. I was not on any contraceptives for over eight years. We never had the thought of having a baby," Aggie said. "It took me like a month to find out I was pregnant because I would have achy breasts.” The dancer is a member of the Sarakasi dance group, where her boyfriend Oscar Mwalo is the chief choreographer. She describes Oscar as her pillar of strength since he has trained her and challenged her to be her best ever since she joined the Sarakari crew.
