More than 100 top golfers converge at Sigona Golf Club for the 6th edition of the Road to Gleneagles Johnnie Walker Golf Series. They will battle it out at the 18-hole, par 72 golf course as they seek to make the cut for the series’ semi-finals dubbed the Eagles’ Round and ultimately the Grand Finale, where a fully paid trip to the iconic Gleneagles Golf Course in Scotland will be up for grabs. The tournament will tee off at 7 am and will be played in the competition’s four-ball stableford format, with the top three winning teams qualifying for the next round. So far, 15 teams have already qualified to play in the next round following the events held at VetLab, Thika Greens, Windsor, Nakuru, and Railways. Speaking ahead of the tournament, Kenya Breweries Limited’s marketing manager for spirits, Josephine Katambo said:  “We just had a very successful event this past weekend at Railways Golf Club and now we are very excited to be heading to Sigona for the sixth leg of the Road to GlenEagles Johnnie Walker Golf Series.”
