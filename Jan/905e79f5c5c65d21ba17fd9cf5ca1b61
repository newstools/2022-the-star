A Nairobi court on Monday issued a warrant of arrest against National Youth Service scandal suspect Phylis Ngirita. Milimani Senior principal magistrate Bernard Ochoi accused Ngirita of failing to appear in court for the hearing of the Sh20 million tax evasion case. "I hereby issue a warrant of arrest against the accused and summons to the investigating officer and the accused to appear in court," ordered Bernard Ochoi. Ngirita, trading as Njewanga Enterprises, faced four counts of failure to submit a tax return contrary to the law. Particulars of the charge are that on December 31, 2017, Ngirita, trading as Njewanga enterprises, jointly with others not before court deliberately failed to pay cooperation tax amounting to Sh13.7 million in 2017.
