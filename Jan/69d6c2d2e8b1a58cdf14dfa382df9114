The 2021 Africa Junior champion Angela Okutoyi will face Yan Yin of Australia in the J1 Traralgon Junior international tennis tournament in Melbourne, Australia today. Okutoyi, who is using the tournament as a warm-up for the Junior Australian Open tournament which kicks off in a week's time, is upbeat and focused on the event. “It's been a dream come true to play in a grand slam tournament of this nature and so I am very excited," said Okutoyi. The 2018  Kenya Open champion said she is fully adjusted to the hot conditions down under and had a couple of training sessions to acclimatise. “The conditions are quite tough but I am now getting used to them and I can't wait for my first match,” added Okutoyi. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion who is ranked 60th for the tournament will be aiming to move up to 30. “I’ve realized that the level I am in doesn’t allow my mindset to think like a junior. "I play with parents, experienced players and that means I have to put up double the effort if I am to reap results. I’m aiming for a top 30 bracket and I believe I’ll achieve it," said Okutoyi. The Junior Australia Open starts on January 22-29th and Okutoyi said the build-up event will be ideal. "There is a good chance the players I am playing against in the warm are probably the ones I meet in the main event. So I will be using this event to get to know their strengths and weaknesses," he added. Okutoyi is among 46 players enlisted for the main draw in the girls’ category. This will be her first Australian Open Junior Championship.
