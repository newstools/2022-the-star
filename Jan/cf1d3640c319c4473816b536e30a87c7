ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Monday take his Azimio la Umoja campaigns to Murang'a county. Prior to meeting and speaking to Murang'a residents, the former Prime Minister will first hold a meeting with leaders from the county at Thika Golf club. After the meeting, he will proceed to Thika greens where he will have a meeting with area residents. This comes a day after Raila camped in Nakuru county where he held a series of meetings with area leaders allied to the Azimio la Umoja Movement. Deputy President William Ruto meanwhile on Monday received Starehe MP, Charles Njagua as he joined the United Democratic Alliance party. The DP received the MP at his Karen residence. "Starehe MP Charles Njagua alias Jaguar joins the United Democratic Alliance. The Hustler Nation continues to grow," Ruto said. "...a time has come and decisions have to be made, the welfare of the people has to be considered. Starehe is a cosmopolitan constituency with many Small Medium Enterprises(SMEs) and the bottom-up idealogy suits them best," Jaguar said. The MP said he felt that working with the Deputy President in his party as he runs for his presidential bid and as he works towards implementing his policies is the best option for the Starehe people. On Sunday, Ruto attended the ANC party's National Delegates Convention where Musalia Mudavadi was endorsed as the party's flagbearer.
