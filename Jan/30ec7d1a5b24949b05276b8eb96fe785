Huge crowds have already gathered at the Eldoret Sports Club for Deputy President William Ruto's mega rally on Saturday. The rally will be used by elders and locals to bless and send him off for the presidential campaigns. An estimated 50,000 people are expected to fill up the venue with more than 90 MPS allied to the DP having confirmed attendance. Ruto arrived at the venue at 11 am in a convoy of the MPs and UDA party officials. He was escorted from his Sugoi home in a convoy through Eldoret to the venue located on the Eldoret-Kisumu road. Among those present are governors, senators and MPS including Ann Waiguru, Jackson Mandago, Oscar Sudi, Kimani Ichungwa, Isaac Mwaura, Mithika Linturi, Ali Mohammed, Aisha Jumwa, Caleb Kositany, Aden Duale, Kipchumba Murkomen, Jane Kihara, Stephen Sang, Alice Wahome among others. "We are set and we have mobilized adequately to give the DP a befitting send-off and blessings," said Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago. More than 5,000 aspirants of the party are also expected at the meeting. Elders from the Kalenjin, Kikuyu and other communities as well as church leaders will perform blessings for the DP. Last night, hundreds of UDA supporters thronged Eldoret town to celebrate ahead of today's rally. Hotel owners reported booming business as supporters travelled overnight to wait for the mega meeting. Ruto is also expected to make announcements on his plans ahead of the August 9th polls. The DP's UDA party is expected to be dominant in the Rift Valley region which has more than 3.5 million voters ahead of the August polls. Edited by D Tarus
