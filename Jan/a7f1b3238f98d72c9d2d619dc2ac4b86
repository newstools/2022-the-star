Fast-food chain KFC has opened up on why they cannot buy potatoes grown by Kenyan farmers. The company's CEO for the East Africa region Jacques Theunissen, in an interview with a local daily, cited quality approval procedures as the reason why they cannot source local potatoes. “The reason we cannot buy local at the moment is all suppliers need to go through the global QA approval process and we cannot bypass that even if we run out to ensure that our food is safe for consumption by our customers,” he told Business Daily. The CEO also revealed to the daily that the stock ran out as a result of a hitch in the global supply of potatoes. He noted that there have been delays in the shipping lines because of the Covid pandemic and said efforts are underway to restock. “Ships have been delayed for more than a month now, but we are working hard to restore as the first containers are arriving in the port today (Tuesday),” said Theunissen. KFC, on Monday, announced to its customers that they can not serve them their favourite fried chips owing to lack of stock. The company, known for selling distinct fried chicken and French fries locally referred to as chips, announced alternative meals it is now offering Kenyans even as they pledged on restocking as soon as possible. "Fam it was truly a Furaha December. Mlikula sherehe with your KFC faves. Ya'll loved our chips a little too much, and we've run out," KFC tweeted. "Sorry! Our team is working hard to resolve the issue. In the meantime here are some SWAP options for combo meals if you are craving our Kuku." The fast-food outlet imports most of its food products reportedly in a bid to give their customers across the world "same quality and taste" and to also "to keep up with international standards". They source their potatoes from Egypt which is one of the largest producers of the product globally.
