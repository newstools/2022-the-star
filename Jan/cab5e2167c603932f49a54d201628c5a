Nairobi Governor Anne Kananu has attributed her success as city governor to ODM party leader Raila Odinga. Kananu was speaking during Raila Odinga's 77th birthday celebration feted at Bomas of Kenya. She noted that if not for Odinga she would not be governor. "I am the firstborn of the handshake, If it was not for baba, you would not have a woman governor in Nairobi," Kananu said. She further thanked the party leader for the current state of Nairobi County. "Ninataka tuambiane ukweli leo ndio watu waache propaganda mingi; Baba amesimama na Nairobi,” Kananu stated. The county boss said the peace and stability being witnessed in Nairobi is because of Raila's support. She added that Nairobi is fully behind the Azimio la Umoja. "Wale wanasema tuko na rally ingine huku, hio ni yao," she added. Kananu promised Odinga her full support in his presidential bid. "We are going to use our resources, me, My family and everybody in Nairobi to ensure we vote for baba on August 9, 2022,” she said. Kananu was sworn in as Nairobi's third and first female Governor on November 16, 2021, after former Governor Mike Sonko was impeached. Kananu recently declared that she will defend her seat this year, telling her competitors that they will meet at the ballot. Edited by D Tarus
