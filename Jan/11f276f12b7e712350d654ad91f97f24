Deputy President William Ruto is mourning Father Francis Xavier Opondo. In a statement on Sunday, Ruto describe Father Francis as a leader of great faith, whose preaching was spiritually nourishing. He went on to say that the clergyman was a dedicated Samaritan who offered divine counsel to the community and uplifted the lives of many underprivileged people. The DP prayed for comfort to his family, friends and the church he served. "Our love and prayers to the family, their loved ones and the St. Francis Xavier Kapkoi Catholic Parish fraternity and the entire Catholic Diocese of Kitale during this painful time. Rest In Peace, Father Opondo," Ruto said in a tweet. Father Opondo died on Friday after a long battle with prostate cancer. His death was confirmed by the Kitale Catholic Diocesan Vicar general Father Micah Kemboi. "The entire Diocese is shocked by the death of our Reverend Father. A priest who has served this diocese with a lot of dedication, a generous man who inspired even me to join the priesthood," he said. "Father Opondo passed on, Friday after a long time illness of prostate cancer. We want to commend him to our Lord Jesus Christ." He will be laid to rest on Thursday.
