Churchill comedian Akuku Danger is fighting for his life after one of his lungs collapsed. Akuku was born with sickle-cell anaemia. Fellow funnyman Hamo said Akuku has been ailing for years as the condition is hereditary. "Many are the days he stood on the Churchill Show stage to make Kenyans laugh while he needed the joy," Hamo wrote while pleading for financial help. "He is a fighter and I believe God will heal him. He gave us laughter, let's give him our support." Fellow comedians and friends are fundraising for his medications on their WhatsApp groups. During the New Year's Eve show, Churchill took some time off the show and requested those in attendance to stand with the comedian. They managed to raise more than Sh400,000.
