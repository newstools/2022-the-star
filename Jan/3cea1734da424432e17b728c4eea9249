Rapper Prezzo says his mother comes first in his life as she endured a lot to raise him and his siblings after she lost her husband. Speaking to Mpasho, Prezzo paid tribute to his mum saying no woman's love can beat his mum. "My mum comes first. Whoever said the best way to a man's heart is through the stomach lied. The best way is through his mother," he said. "Once you are OK with your mother-in-law then things will be smooth but if not then it's not up for discussion." Asked whether he is a mama's boy, Prezzo said nothing is gonna change what he feels for his mum. "There is no other artiste who has suffered media brutality as I have," he said. "If I was soft I would have broken down by now. My dad passed away while I was 13 and my mum had to play the role of both mum and dad. She has been through a lot and I love her for that. It does not matter whether you are 40 or 17, you are always your mother's child. People who pull the 'mama's boy' card are just miserable." Prezzo also spoke about his grill company, called Grills By Prezzo. "The grills are customised. A mama's boy cannot do half the things I do," he said. "I will always give her the respect she deserves. She has always been there for me during the bad and good times."
