Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka's meeting at his Yatta farm home, in Machakos County, was interrupted briefly by a snake that emerged in a tent where leaders had sat. The incident caused a huge commotion as a section of those present at the tent moved with speed to kill the snake. Here is the video: No one was hurt. The Wiper leader hosted leaders from the Kamba region in a bid to chart their political future as the country heads to 2022 polls. Hundreds of leaders from the Eastern region attended the event. However, governors from the three main counties snubbed the meeting. Governor Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Charity Ngilu (Kitui) and Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) dismissed the meeting terming it personal. In a statement, the group said a community political meeting should not be held at someone's home but in public field.
