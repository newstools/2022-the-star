Shujaa's dismal showing at the Malaga Sevens continued, losing 26-17 to minnows Japan in the 13th place semifinal on Sunday. Kenya had dropped to the classification matches after winning one pool game — 26-15 against France — before losing 19-17 to Canada,19-14 to Wales and 17-12 to Scotland in the ninth and tenth place playoff. A disjointed Kenya opened the scoring against Japan with Levi Amunga scoring an unconverted try for a 5-0 lead. Japan replied immediately with Kazuma Nakagawa scoring two quick tries, both converted by Taiga Ishida for a 14-5 lead at halftime. On resumption, Amunga reduced the deficit with a well-taken try to 14-10. Japan stepped up a gear as Shun Tomonaga sliced open the Kenya defence to dive over with Ryoto Kano adding the conversion for a 21-10 lead. Shotaro Tsuoka then put the icing on the cake with another try for a 26-10 lead. Johnstone Olindi scored a late consolation try, which he converted to close out the game. Skipper Nelson Oyoo was disappointed with the performance over the two days with one win in five matches a poor reflection of their performance. "We did not play well. We have a few days to correct our mistakes and bounce back in Seville this coming week. We know we can play better and once we have done our review in the next few days, we will come back stronger," Oyoo said.
