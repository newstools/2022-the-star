The Nairobi Metropolitan Services has halted the construction of 870 bed sitter units in Kilimani. In a letter by the director lands, housing and urban renewal S.G Mwangi, NMS said the construction of 870 units on a 0.463 ha was not “acceptable since they exceed the ratios provided.” NMS said its officers visited the building on December 10, 2021 and established that the building plans were not properly drawn. NMS noted that the drawings did not provide sufficient information and that lounges were not ventilated. It also observed that no traffic management report had been provided. The construction was being undertaken by a Chinese firm. “Consequently, the approval granted on 31st October, 2021 and the application pending by NMS vide plan reg. no. CPF AS 740 are hereby disapproved,” wrote Mwangi. The cancellation followed a complaint by a number of residents and owners of property in the neighborhood of Kindaruma road, Kilimani Nairobi. The residents, through Lesinko Njoroge & Gathogo advocates asked NMS to establish if the construction of the high-density bedsitters, studios and one-bedroom units along Kindaruma road was inline with existing zoning policy of Nairobi City County zone 4. The residents also asked NMS to establish if there was a violation of the provisions of Physical Planning and Land use Act No 13 of 2019. They also asked NMS to establish if there was violation of the Environment Management and Coordination Act alongside the Environmental Impact Assessment and Audit Regulations. The residents said the scale and scope of the project was likely to overwhelm the utilities and amenities such as narrow roads arising from increased traffic.
