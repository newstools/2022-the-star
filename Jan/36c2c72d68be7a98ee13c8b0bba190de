Bar and restaurant operators have called on judiciary and churches to support the Covid-19 vaccination drive. This, as they commit to the protocols put in place to limit the spread of the virus. The call comes after last month's High Court order stopping the government from requiring everybody seeking in person government services to show proof of being fully vaccinated. A section of the church has also said it will not stop anyone un-vaccinated person from attending services. “We are calling on Judiciary to stop these orders against the vaccination. The church should also support the drive so that we can have as many people vaccinated as possible,” said Boniface Gachoka, Secretary General Bar, Hotel and Liquor Traders Association (BAHLITA). Last October, the association signed an MoU with the government which allows hotels and bars to be used as vaccination centres. Yesterday, Gachoka said the association is coming up with a system that allows confirmation of a client's vaccination status using a mobile phone. BAHLITA supports proof of vaccination before entering public buildings, an initiative that has been implemented by some malls and businesses. Last month, Justice Anthony Mrima issued the order stopping government from requiring everybody seeking its services physically, to show proof of being fully vaccinated. He directed the matter be heard today (January 4.) Some hotels have been admitting only fully vaccinated persons as they hope to attract international visitors. “Allowing people to resume business is the first step towards attaining the economic prosperity that we all crave,” said Gachoka. The hospitality industry is among the worst hit by the pandemic where more than 200,000 jobs have been lost. The lifting of the nation-wide curfew during the last Mashujaa Day celebrations however gave hope to the industry which saw increased operating hours and movement.
