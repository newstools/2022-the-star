Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya on Friday urged residents of Kakamega county to support Azimio la Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. During the tour, Oparanya surprisingly thanked deputy president William Ruto for bagging the support of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. "I thank Deputy President H.E William Ruto for offloading ANC Leader Hon Musalia Mudavadi who has been a burden to the Luhyia community for many years," he said The Governor held a series of meetings in Mumias addressing residents on the economy and selling Raila to his people. Oparanya expressed confidence that Azimio movement is strong having bagged the support of several area MPs and MCAs. "I took campaigns to popularize Azimio la Umoja and a presidential bid of former PM Rt Hon Raila Odinga to Mumias town and the reception was overwhelming," Oparanya said. He also used the opportunity to thank MPs who defected to Raila's camp after their party leader Mudavadi declared that he will work with Ruto. The MPs who defected from ANC to Raila's camp include Titus Khamala (Lurambi), Tindi Mwale (Butere), Christopher Aseka (Khwisero) and Peter Nabulindo (Matungu), former Shinyalu MP Anami Lisamula and tens of MCAs were among them. According to Oparanya, the defection was fueled by the need by the MPs to heed to voters' demand to quit ANC and support Raila's presidency.
