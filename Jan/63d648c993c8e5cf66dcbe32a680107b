Sofapaka coach Ken Odhiambo is hopeful of a good outing ahead of Saturday’s fixture against soldiers Ulinzi Stars. Odhiambo has expressed uneasy confidence ahead of the clash, saying they are facing a tough opponent. “Ulinzi are not in a good run and that makes Saturday’s fixture a tight one. This match is a good way to show character by bouncing back after a setback,” said Odhiambo on Sofapaka’s official portal. "We were so unlucky against Bandari but we have an opportunity to get ourselves back on track on Saturday against the soldiers. The match is very important for us because a win will have the team within reach of our competitors at the top." With his side six points off top spot, Odhiambo remains hopeful they can string together a good run to move right into the title fight. “We are optimistic our title hopes are within reach because the team is just six points off KCB, who are at the top of the log,” added Odhiambo. Sofapaka will miss the services of Said Tsuma, who was sent off on Tuesday after a second bookable offence. However, they will be glad to have Geoffrey Ojunga back in training after the midfielder from recovered malaria in time for the encounter.  Wilberforce Lugogo, who underwent a minor surgery on his left knee, is a long term absentee.
