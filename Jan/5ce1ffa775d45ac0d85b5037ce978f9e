American female rapper, Cardi B, is a happy woman after winning her libel lawsuit against Latasha Kebe on Monday. According to TMZ, Cardi B was awarded $1.25 million (Sh141.9 million) in general damages and $250k (Sh28.3 million) for medical expenses. Cardi B claimed the blogger made up harmful lies about her on the internet. Latasha K was sued for posting videos where she alleged that Cardi was a prostitute who dabbled in drugs and had contracted STIs among other things. She was also sued for defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. "After a week-plus long trial, Latasha was found liable on 3 separate claims, and ordered to pay Cardi $1.25 million (Sh141.9 million) in general damages," TMZ reported. Cardi sued the blogger in 2019. The judge presiding over the trial said a hearing set for Tuesday will determine what Latasha might have to pay in punitive damages and what would pay in attorneys fees.
