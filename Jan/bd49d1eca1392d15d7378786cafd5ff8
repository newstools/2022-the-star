Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria has hit out at the Azimio la Umoja movement led by ODM leader Raila Odinga. The Azimio is seeking to strike a deal with the ruling Jubilee party ahead of the August 9, elections. In a social media post on Wednesday, Kuria said the movement is doomed to fail. "Azimio is a bad idea, fronted by the wrong people, for all the wrong reasons. Its fate is Jehanum and Judgement Day is here," Kuria said. His latest remarks come as a surprise to many who were speculating that he could join the Azimio movement soon. Kuria, who is recovering abroad after he suffered third-degree burns when his Sh250,000 electric blanket burned his feet, is due to hold a prayer rally at Thika Stadium on February 19. The lawmaker is expected to declare his August 9, elections plan especially after he last year declared he would not run for any elective seat this year. Kuria who is also the leader of Chama Cha Kazi differed with deputy president William Ruto last year after the DP suggested that the Mt Kenya region parties should be dissolved and its members join UDA. However, the recent agreement between UDA, ANC and Ford-Kenya indicates that the DP might have softened his stand on working with parties being perceived as small. Kuria criticised the suggestion and said Mt Kenya region residents should not be taken for a ride. Raila is on Saturday set to have a mega rally in Murang'a where several MPs from the region are expected to attend and endorse him.
