Rights groups based in Isiolo will stage a peaceful demonstration in Isiolo on Tuesday, January 11 to protest the killing of fellow women’s rights activist Elizabeth Ibrahim Ekaru. Isiolo Gender Watch will join hands with the Center for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW) and other Human Rights Defenders in Kenya to petition the government to hasten the investigations into Ekaru’s murder. In a letter of notification to the officer commanding the Central Police Station in Isiolo, the activists said that they would deliver their petition to the county commissioner of Isiolo county. “The Human Rights Defenders will also use the platform to follow up on other femicide-related deaths,” read the letter. Ekaru was found dead at her home in Isiolo on January 3, with stab wounds after an alleged confrontation with her neighbour over land. The neighbour, Patrick Nawit, is still in police custody, nursing wounds at a hospital in Isiolo after he was assaulted by a mob following the discovery of Ekaru’s death. The activists said the procession would begin at 9:00 AM taking the route from Isiolo Catholic Mission through town and end at the County Commissioner’s Office. “We, therefore, request for state security during the peaceful procession,” it read further. They added that a petition will be delivered to the Office of the President through the Office of the County Commissioner of Isiolo.
