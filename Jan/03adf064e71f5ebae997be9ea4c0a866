The latest figures from the Ministry of Health indicate that the new cases of coronavirus in the country keep soaring, with the presence of the Omicron variant that was identified in the country in December last year. This comes amid intensified political campaigns in the country ahead of the August General Election. As always in any country during the election period, false information is rampant. On Tuesday, a post from a prominent blogger went viral on social media claiming that Deputy President William Ruto and one of his allies, MP Kimani Ichung’wa, tested positive for coronavirus. According to blogger Robert Alai’s claims, Kikuyu legislator Ichung’wa had agreed to quarantine for 10 days before continuing Ruto campaigns. “Ruto has decided and told his team that he cannot afford to quarantine and as he must campaign,” Alai claimed. However, the fact-checker has confirmed that the claims are false and that neither of the two mentioned individuals tested positive for the virus. A member of Ruto's communication who sought anonymity said the DP does not have Covid, and termed 'propaganda' claims he had the virus. By the time the propaganda was being spread, the DP was campaigning in the Western region, accompanied by a number of MPs allied to him. Previously, when Covid cases were higher, Ruto took a break from campaigns just as the government announced a ban on political gatherings. While the blogger said that the MP had accepted the outcome and decided to take a 10-day period of quarantine, the MP was among the legislators who physically attended the National Assembly Special Sittings on Wednesday.
