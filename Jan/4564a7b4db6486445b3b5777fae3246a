Deputy President William Ruto has been enjoying a commanding leading in the race to State House for some time now, according to various opinion polls. Despite recent opinion polls indicating that ODM leader Raila Odinga, his fierce competitor, is closing the gap, the DP appears to be the man to beat. Considering the ODM leader declared his presidential bid less than two months ago, the two leaders are poised for a major showdown ahead of the August 9 polls. While Raila has made several attempts in the presidential seat, the DP will be eyeing the top seat for the first time in his political career.
