Former TV presenter Terryanne Chebet says she worked with toxic colleagues in the media. Through her socials, Terryanne said a male colleague made most of them cry. "There were some toxic people, like one who perhaps every female TV journalist cringed to work with," she said. "He was the bully.com and sadly got away with everything. He made so many journos cry in the newsrooms! "Horrid memories, but, I’d probably work for a media house only if I owned it so I could make it a place where people loved to go to, every single day." Terryanne added that she would never return to being a full-time anchor. "Filming today made me miss my anchorwoman job! But would I do it again? Nope," she said. "At least never full-time again. It was great but the bad times were bad."
