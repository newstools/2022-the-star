A poor pre-season is the reason why Kisumu All Starlets are struggling in the Kenya Women's Premier League this season, according to team manager, Beryl Oketch. The lakeside club has had the worst possible start to the 2021/22 season with no victory in the opening two matches while conceding 12 goals. Kisumu fell 6-0 and 6-2 to Gaspo and Zetech respectively. They are bottom of the WPL standings with zero points having managed only two goals as they try to cope in the absence of dynamic midfielder Mercyline Wayodi who joined former champions Vihiga Queens. Oketch, who doubles up as the chairlady of WPL, wants the players to shoulder responsibility and solve the set-piece problem that has beset the team. "I don't like giving excuses but honestly, we didn't have a thorough pre-season as a team.  It is evident our players lack endurance in the games we have played and look fatigued especially in the second half." "Set piece defending is an area that needs to be addressed. We have given away easy goals because of a lack of maximum concentration but I hope we can find our footing when we play Kangemi Ladies, Wednesday." "Players are not mentally prepared, owing to the busy festive schedule but it's time to start producing results." Oketch further revealed that clubs are expected to receive Sh300,000 each this week for a six-month period courtesy of the caretaker committee. "KPL and WPL clubs will likely get funds before this weekend. It will be a big relief for the clubs that have been struggling financially. We have  traveled with a few players to our away matches because of the logistical challenge." "The amount is sufficient for clubs to prepare for three or four matches a month and it's strictly for logistics" All the 12 teams in the top tier will be back in action on Wednesday with six matches to be played.
