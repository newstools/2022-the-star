Terry Anne Chebet has introduced her bae on social media. She shared a photo followed with the caption, 'Te Amo' and her fans flooded her with congratulatory messages. Maureen Waititu said yes to love. Speaking to Word Is, Terryanne laughed off the question. In a past interview with Grace Msalame, she vowed to keep her love life away from the public eye to avoid unnecessary criticism and bad energy. "I believe there is a reason why personal is actually called personal and there are things that are your personal life that should remain that way.  And if you put too much out there, it invites criticism and bad energy," she said. "So as for me, I said I will protect my dating life, I will protect the people I date because they are not public personalities."
