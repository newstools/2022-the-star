Nigerian superstars Davido and Wizkid hugged at a popular club in Lagos, Nigeria, proving they have set aside their differences. For a long time, fans have speculated there is beef between the two artistes as they have not been seeing eye to eye. In 2020, Davido congratulated Wizkid on his album 'Made In Lagos', calling him 'King', but he did not get a response. In 2017, it was reported that the two singer's camps got into a fight after the One Africa Music Festival in Dubai. The same year, Wizkid brought Davido on stage at his concert and vice versa happened the same year. The two have had a bittersweet relationship as the cause of their long-time beef is only known to them.
