Cheptais MCA Jane Chebet on Monday ditched UDA and joined Moses Wetang'ula's Ford Kenya. Chebet, who has declared interest in the Mt Elgon MP seat, has been a staunch follower of Deputy President William Ruto. Political pundits believe that Chebet left UDA for fear of being defeated by current MP Fred Kapondi who is also a close ally of the DP. Mt Elgon is one of the areas where Ruto expects to harvest votes as the area is mainly occupied by the Sabaot community. Chebet, a second time MCA, was first elected in 2013 on the ODM ticket. She bagged the seat again in 2017 on the Jubilee ticket. After Chebet defected, she was received by Bungoma county Ford Kenya chairperson Catherine Wambilianga, who is also the area Woman Representative. "I have been soul-searching. I made this decision after seeking advice from my supporters who asked me to join Ford Kenya since it is popular in the county. This is to avoid humiliation in UDA during nominations," the ward rep said. Wambilianga assured Chebet of fair and free nominations in Ford Kenya,  adding that she had made the right decision. "We are happy and proud of you and Ford Kenya as our party and heritage, you are home and dry. I wish you all the best in your next political journey," she said. Edited by A.N
