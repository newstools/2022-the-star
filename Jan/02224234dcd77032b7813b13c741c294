ODM leader Raila Odinga now claims Deputy President William Ruto has sensed defeat ahead of the August 9 polls. The Opposition Chief denied Ruto's claims that he planned the Jacaranda chaos. He accused UDA of sponsoring last Sunday's chaos after sensing defeat. The former Prime Minister said he will vanquish the DP in the State House race. "Our competitors are now claiming that ODM is planning violence...there is nothing like that, " Raila said. "We will defeat them on the ballot, the tsunami is coming." Raila spoke Tuesday at City Hall when he launched the countrywide enhanced voter registration exercise. Raila also scoffed at Ruto's city forays saying Nairobi is locked under his Azimio La Umoja movement. He said the movement will get over 1.6 million in Nairobi alone. "I got over 900,000 votes in the last election, President Uhuru got 700,000. Cumulatively we got over 1.6 million votes. In the coming elections we will get more," he said. Ruto resumes his tour of Nairobi county on Tuesday, with rallies planned across sub-counties perceived to be ODM leader Raila Odinga’s strongholds. This will be the DP’s fourth day traversing Nairobi as he seeks support for his presidential bid, as well as popularising the United Democratic Alliance party. In his programme, Ruto is expected to make at least eight stops, in Lang’ata, Kibra, Westlands and also Dagoretti North and South constituencies.
