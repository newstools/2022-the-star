Nameless and a number of Kenyan artists have released a tribute song to  E-Sir. The video of the song Bandana Ya E-Sir stars Wahu, Wyre, Jua Cali and Nyashinski. Rapper King Kaka is said to have designed the bandana used in the music video. Speaking about the song, Nameless said the project is very close to his heart. "We celebrate our brother E-Sir with a cross-generation of artists! Some Veterans made a cameo to show love for our fallen friend," he said. Habib, E-Sir's brother, said what he misses most about his famous sibling is his hard-working nature. "I was happy when I heard the idea to feature in 'Bandana Ya E-Sir because I remember E-Sir telling me the reason he did music was so that he is remembered forever. So I was for the idea from the word go," he said. "I remember how he [E-Sir] was hard working. There is a time he would trek from home to where the studios were." On Nameless and Wahu’s reality show, Nelly The Goon said he had been working on the tribute song for two years now. "I have written this song for like two years. I needed to do this for a legend that has done it for the music. He inspired me so much, he needs to be taken as the legend he is." Wahu, who had accompanied her husband Nameless, said, “It is an interesting song because it bigs up E-Sir and I like that idea.” E-Sir, born Issah Mmari, died on March 16, 2003, in an accident on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway on his way back to Nairobi from a concert in Nakuru. He was accompanied by his colleague and best friend Nameless.
