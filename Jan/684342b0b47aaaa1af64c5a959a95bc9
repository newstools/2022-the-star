The construction of a new renal unit at the Taveta Subcounty Hospital is 95 per cent complete, Taita Taveta health executive John Mwakima has said. Mwakima said the new unit shall be commissioned by April. He said it will be a reprieve for kidney patients who have been travelling to Moi County Referral Hospital in Voi and Moshi in neighbouring Tanzania for dialysis services. The executive said the dialysis services centre will be equipped with medical equipment which have improved diagnostic and various medical procedures. “The Voi renal unit is already overwhelmed. This will be a key facility meant to serve people in this region,” Mwakima said during an inspection tour of the facility on Thursday. The facility has attracted patients from Makueni and Kwale counties, making it overstretched. The Voi renal unit is manned by 51-year-old Dr Heriberto Acosta Rodas, a Cuban nephrologist. Mwakima said the health department has recorded remarkable strides in achieving the Universal Health Coverage initiative by implementing various infrastructural development projects. The renal unit, he said is among strategies put in place to advance health services in Taveta subcounty. “Once everything in this renal unit is complete and machines installed, renal patients will no longer incur expenses travelling outside Taveta,” he said. To boost service delivery in the hospital, Mwakima said the department has posted two more specialists to supplement the existing staffers. They are Cuban general surgeon Dr Claudio Pablo Jimenez with over 33 years of experience and Dr Juma Oduor, an obstetrician-gynaecologist. “Dr Claudio, who is barely 3 weeks old in this station has performed eight specialised surgical procedures,” Mwakima said. He said the two specialists had positively boosted specialised health care in the county. The executive promised to support the medics and urged them to share their knowledge and skills with local medical practitioners. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
