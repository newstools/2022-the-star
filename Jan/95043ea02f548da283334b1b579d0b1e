New Public Service Commission chairperson Anthony Muchiri on Friday pledged to reposition the public service as the employer of choice. “We must go the extra mile to re-position the public service as the employer of choice for those who opt to join it because they are driven by nothing else but the call and will to serve,” Muchiri said. He spoke during his inaugural meeting with the PSC secretariat at KICC. Muchiri said there are plans to strengthen networks between the three arms of government, the private sector, donor agencies and the youth, women, persons with disabilities and the diaspora. Muchiri assured staff he would build consensus across all levels to strengthen the secretariat’s capacity to deliver. “I will eliminate, through decisive administrative decisions, the low morale, stagnation and low wages and in return expect a return to the 'call and will to serve' mantra,” he said. He said the "call and will to serve” mantra is not fundamentally different from the “Reform, Perform, Transform Kenya” mantra that the Commission staff are familiar with. “In fact, they are complimentary of each other. In my view, the 'call and will to serve' is simply a return to the basics,” he said. He said the basics that defined public service as a calling were driven and inspired more by the will to serve than personal interest. Muchiri said the Commission had already set out a clear trajectory, eloquently articulated in the strategic plan. “We will continue with it, scale up and work together to transform the public service into a dynamic, anticipatory, responsive and influential organisation,” he said. Present during the meeting were PSC vice chairperson Charity Kisotu, commissioners, CEO Dr Simon Rotich, directors and secretariat staff. Muchiri took over as chairperson of the Public Service Commission in December last year. He replaced the late Stephen Kirogo, who passed away in May 2021.
