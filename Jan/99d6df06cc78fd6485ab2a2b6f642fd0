Kiambu county has embarked on improving markets by spacing traders. Governor James Nyoro said his administration will build modern markets so that traders and customers are accommodated. He said since Covid-19 was reported in the country, traders and customers have been suffering because they have to obey the government's directive of observing social distance. Nyoro said that for many years, traders in the county have been working in open air markets with poor working conditions. "Our traders have been working in poor conditions and in the open air. They are scorched by the hot sun and rained on," he said. "We are going to build them markets with roofs, and with good and modern facilities like running water, tanks, modern lavatories and good drainages." "Whenever it rains, we are forced to close businesses owing to the terrible conditions. Our market has no roof,"Joel Ng'ang'a, a trader, said. Ng'ang'a also said that the market will accommodate hawkers who attract customers who buy from them. He said even if they are not sure when Gitaru market will be complete, they are sure that they will get a modern facility. Some of the complete markets are Kihara, Kikuyu, Ruiru, among others. "The idea is to improve working conditions, accommodate more traders, improve hygiene and motivate our traders," the county chief said. Nyoro was speaking at Gitaru market in Kabete subcounty on Friday, where his administration is rehabilitating one of the county's old open air markets. The governor, who toured Gitaru town on foot to Kikuyu town, interacted with traders and hawkers who also listed their challenges. He was accompanied Deputy Governor Joyce Ngugi and Kikuyu subcounty administrator Michael Mutuku, among other county officials. (edited by Amol Awuor)
