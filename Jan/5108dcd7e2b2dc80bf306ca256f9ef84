Schon Ahmed Noorani has been battling to recover the amount loaned to a friend Rajendra Ratilal Sanghani over a decade ago. Documents filed in court show that Noorani loaned his friend turned foe the money between August 2012 and April 2018 and the money would be repaid with interest. The total amount loaned was Sh477 million and Rajendra paid the amount leaving a balance of Sh167million. Rajendra admitted the debt but said he fell into financial difficulties owing to prevailing harsh economic conditions. What followed has been court battles as Noorani sought to recover the debt.

Justice Okwany ordered the directors or agents of the eight companies to furnish the court with financial documents and account of money or dividends due to Sanghani.

Others are Gut Ventures ltd, Shivali Holdings ltd, Jyotin Investments ltd and Granada Trading Company ltd. The matter will come up on March 23 to confirm whether the cite companies have complied with the directive. In 2018, High Court judge Francis Tuiyot told Noorani to wait before taking any action against Rajendra who owed him Sh167 million. Rajendra owed Noorani Sh167, 270,500 as the balance for a Sh477,100,000 unsecured loan advanced between August 1, 2012 and April 26, 2018.
