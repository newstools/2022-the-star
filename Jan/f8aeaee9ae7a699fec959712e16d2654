Former National Assembly Majority Leader has described as mischievous the push to give timelines for the formation of the coalition parties. The Garissa Township MP said some external forces are hiding behind the Bill to force some political players into a coalition ahead of the August vote. Duale has moved to delete Clause 8(b) of the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that seeks to provide the formation of the coalition political party. The clause also compels Parties to submit the coalition agreements to the Registrar six months to the general election, which basically means by February. However, proponents of the Bill are against Duale’s amendment but are instead pushing for a review of the timeline for submission of agreement to four months. “My honest opinion is that this House should not be used as a decoy to achieving selfish interest and sanitize the character of certain leaders and parties known for political deceit every time they enter a coalition with other leaders,” Duale said. “The legislation should not be used to sanitise some leaders who have used parties for conmanship.” Earlier, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi directed the use of electronic voting ahead of the debate on the Bill. Muturi directed members without chamber electronic cards to contact the Clerk’s office. Electronic voting is viewed as the only way to defeat the filibustering tactics of pro-Deputy President William Ruto MPs who have been making deliberate attempts to frustrate the Bill.
