It’s the weekend, time for that pamper and skincare routine. A full body scrub should also be on that list, for that silky soft skin. Body scrubs are mechanical exfoliants, meaning they physically remove dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin. Scrubbing stimulates skin cell turnover, resulting in smoother, brighter skin. A good scrub is gentle and complements the balance of your skin. First, rinse your skin with warm water, then put a small amount of body scrub in your hand. Gently scrub in circular motions using your hand or an exfoliating glove. Make sure you don’t scrub longer than 30 seconds. Rinse, cleanse, pat your skin dry and moisturize. Scrubbing once or twice a week is advised and opting for a fragrance-free scrub is recommended for sensitive skin. Avoid using scrubs on sunburns, damaged skin, or irritated skin as it makes the situation worse. Don’t be tricked into overdoing it on oily skin. If you strip the skin of too much oil, you can actually trigger more production by the body to compensate for the lost oil.
