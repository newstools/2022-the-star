Vihiga Queens coach Boniface Nyamunyamu has cautioned his charges against resting on their laurels  after they thumped Zetech Sparks 5-0 in a one-sided Kenya Women's Premier League match at Ruaraka grounds on Saturday. Tereza Engesha and Christine Nafula netted a brace each to set Queens up for the big win on a day that former Kibera Soccer midfielder Lorna Nyarinda also got her name on the scoresheet. The win — their sixth in seven matches — fired them to the top of the table with 19 points from a possible 21. They only dropped a point against Gaspo last weekend after playing out to a barren draw at Mumias Sports Complex. Nyamunyamu, who took over from Alex Alumira, said his team played according to the script, adding he will continue to tweak his squad to enhance competition. "The win was satisfactory but we cannot dwell on today's performance. We have to remain focused, take one match at a time and see what happens," said Nyamunyamu. "We were 2-0 up at halftime and the plan was to safeguard the result, play without pressure and wait for our chances. Engesha Janet Bundi and Moureen Achieng started in attack. “There's also Nyarinda and Situma. Rotation will be key with matches coming thick and fast, he added. "His counterpart Benard Kitolo blamed poor officiating for deflating his players."We need professional referees in the women's game. Most of the decisions went against us and it was clear from the start that the referee was biased," Kitolo bemoaned. “Vihiga played well. Experience was in their favour and they punished us with our mistakes. We have to polish our finishing if we have to return to winning ways against Wadadia,” he asked. The season is almost hitting the halfway mark with teams expected to recruit in the mid season transfer window. Engesha's double takes her tally to nine goals as the race for the Golden Boot hots up. The county-sponsored side take on minnows Kangemi Ladies next week.
