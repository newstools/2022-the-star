Kenya Power has announced a power supply outage following the collapse of towers on transmission power lines. "We have lost power supply due to collapsed towers on the Kiambere-Embakasi highs voltage transmission power line at 10:45 am this morning," the company said. In a statement on Tuesday, Kenya power said their engineers are working to restore the electricity supply. "An update on the restoration progress will be issued in due course. We wish to apologise to our customers for the inconveniences caused," it said. KPLC has not given a timeframe within which power supply is expected to be back. A company spokesperson confirmed the outage was nationwide. The power outage was also experienced on Monday with Kenya power not giving the exact reasons for the blackouts. Kenya Power is the country's sole electricity distributor and the bulk of its power comes from Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen). In May 2020, Kenya experienced a similar nationwide outage after a section of a high voltage power line that transmits power to Nairobi from the Olkaria geothermal power plants, some 75 km (45 miles) from Nairobi, broke. In late December, a section of another transmission line known as Loyaingalani-Suswa, collapsed, knocking out some power supply from the grid and leading to power rationing in some parts of the country while it was being repaired. In 2016, a single monkey caused a nationwide blackout after falling onto a crucial piece of equipment. The monkey fell on a transformer at the Gitaru hydroelectric power station. This made the transformer trip, resulting in the loss of 180 megawatts of power and triggering a blackout across Kenya. Power was restored almost four hours later and the monkey survived its adventure.
