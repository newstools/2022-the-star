Experienced Harambee Starlets forward Tereza Engesha  could soon land a pro deal in Europe after signing a representation agreement with Bulgarian Player Agency LTA, on Friday. The fleet-footed striker is rumoured to be on the radar of most European clubs after starring for Vihiga for the last four seasons. Engesha scored five goals in the Cecafa Club Champions League qualifiers as Queens clinched the title. She was also named woman of the match in Vihiga's 2-0 win over Morocco's AS FAR in Egypt last November. "We are delighted to announce the signing of Vihiga Queens and Harambee Starlets striker Tereza Engesha by LTA agency. Welcome to the team Tereza," a statement from the agency's Twitter account read. Engesha becomes the second Vihiga player to ink a deal with the renowned  agency after Jentrix Shikangwa did so in October last year. Shikangwa ultimately secured her dream move to Turkish top division side Fatih Karagumruk earlier in the week, with LTA central to the deal. Goalkeeper Lilian Awuor will also further her career in France after signing for Soyaux Women Football Club. Engesha currently leads the Kenya Women's Premier League goal scoring chart having found the back of the net on nine ocassions. She was named Kenya Footballers Welfare Association (KEFWA) player of the year in 2019 after guiding Queens to their third WPL title with 36 goals. Vihiga Queens chief executive officer Mike Senelwa has previously reiterated their willingness to become a global force in exporting players overseas. He added that the club won't stand in the way of the player should a suitable offer be tabled.
