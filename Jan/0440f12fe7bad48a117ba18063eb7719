Gospel singer Rose Muhando says she is searching for a financially stable Mzungu man to marry her. On her social media handles, the Nibebe hitmaker said that is her major prayer item this year. "Ombi langu mwaka huu nataka nipate mume mzungu na mwenye hela (My main prayer item this year is to get a white husband who is financially stable)," Muhando posted. In a past interview, the mother of three said she was satisfied with being a single mum. "I have never gotten married since I do not think I can live with a man and handle him well," she said. "I travel a lot and so my work cannot allow me to be with him always. Maybe I find one who is very understanding, but I am very careful with my job and I protect it so much." Muhando said she got pregnant with different men while she was living in the streets. The baby daddies left her when she was either pregnant or the child was young.
