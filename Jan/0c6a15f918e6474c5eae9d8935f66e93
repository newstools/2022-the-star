She said the sky is the limit as she accepted the Oscar award for best-supporting actress in the film 12 Years a Slave, but she's proving that maybe the sky ain't the limit after all. Lupita Nyong'o is clearly all about winning and hitting us with those breathtaking surprises. The Blank Panther star has all the reasons to smile as her 2022 has started on a high note. Lupita is starring in the film, The 355 (Work together or die alone), which was released to the theatres on January 7. Taking to Twitter, an excited Lupita shared a clip of behind the scenes, thanking the stunt team for helping her face her fears. "Sometimes COURAGE sounds like this! Grateful to my incredible The 355 stunt team for helping me face my fears head-on. The 355 Movie is in theatres now!! She also stated that the fight scenes are definitely more badass than what she had shared. The movie stars Oscar-nominated actress Jessica Chastain, Penelope Cruz, Diane Kruger and Lupita. Universal Pictures describes the movie as a dream team of formidable female stars coming together in a hard-driving original approach to the globe-trotting espionage genre. When a top-secret weapon falls into mercenary hands, wild card CIA agent Mason “Mace” Brown (Jessica Chastain) will need to join forces with rival badass German agent Marie (Diane Kruger), former MI6 ally and cutting-edge computer specialist Khadijah (Lupita Nyong’o), and skilled Colombian psychologist Graciela (Penélope Cruz) on a lethal, breakneck mission to retrieve it, while also staying one step ahead of a mysterious woman, Lin Mi Sheng (Bingbing Fan), who is tracking their every move.
