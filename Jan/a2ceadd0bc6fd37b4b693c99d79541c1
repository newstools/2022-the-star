Shujaa' s chances of advancing to the Main Cup quarterfinals went up in smoke following their 14-10 loss to Scotland in the Seville Sevens on Saturday. It was the second consecutive defeat for Kenya at the hands of the Scots who had earlier beaten them 17-12 in Malaga last weekend. A well taken try by Gavin Lowe — which was not converted — handed the Scots a 5-0 lead. Vincent Onyala leveled matters for Kenya with the match tied at 5-5 at the interval. The Scots came out firing on all cylinders and it wasn't long before Ross Mcann crossed the whitewash with Harvey Elms adding the conversion for 12-5. Kenya rallied and Johnstone Olindi finally scored to reduce the deficit to 12-10 with unconverted try. Shujaa rallied for a third try but the Scottish defence held firm to close out the win. Innocent Simiyu's charges will now play in the classification matches on Sunday for the second consecutive weekend.
