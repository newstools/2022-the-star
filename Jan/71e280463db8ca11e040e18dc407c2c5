A mimosa is a delicious combination of champagne and orange juice. Its name is derived from mimosa, the plant as the colour of the drink resembles the plants colour. It is simple to prepare, fruity, fun, and perfect to serve to company, with its origin dating from France. Mimosas are commonly served during brunch but can be enjoyed (just like wine) at ones leisure. Note: For best results avoid using ice cubes as they'll dilute and diminish the wines carbonation. Instead, use chilled wine and orange juice for the cocktail, you can refrigerate them the day before you plan on preparing the cocktails. You can chill your flute glass as well, minutes before you serve the drink for extra chillness. Ingredients. Method; A mimosa calls for an equal ratio of sparkling wine to orange juice. But this can be altered to ones preference, you can have more wine than juice or the other way round. Freshly squeeze orange juice then strain it into a pitcher to sieve out the pulp, you can also use store bought juice but freshly squeezed has a lighter and slightly tart yet delicate taste. When making a mimosa, always add the sparkling wine first, then top with orange juice otherwise the mixture might overflow and make a mess. Slowly pour the wine into a tilted champagne flute allowing it to run down the inside of the glass so as it doesn't loose carbonation. Then top the wine with orange juice, this way the cocktail mixes on its own and doesn’t make a sticky mess at the top of the glass. Note: Do not stir the cocktail as this will lead to the wine going flat. Also use wine that you actually like the taste of. Ensure that you serve in a champagne flute as they're designed to preserve carbonation making your drink extra bubbly. Enjoy.
