Deputy President William Ruto will this afternoon hold a mother of all rallies at Jacaranda grounds, a day after ODM leader Raila Odinga’s campaigns campaign launch in Thika. Ruto who attended a church service at PCEA Pipeline will lead a strong delegation of Tangatanga leaders to Jacaranda in a spirited move to make claim of Nairobi’s over three million voters. The DP also addressed a rally at Pipeline estate as he builds momentum for the afternoon rally. Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga – Ruto’s close confidant – said the city will today be painted yellow as a show of solidarity with the Ruto led UDA party. “Hustlers will throng the ground to welcome and listen to H.E William Ruto as he sends a subtle message of victory, economic recovery and social transformation,” Omanga said. The Star has established that Ruto’s strategists have mapped the city’s electoral areas and hope to challenge ODM boss Raila Odinga’s dominance of Nairobi politics. Ruto has dedicated six days to tour the county estates as he seeks to popularise his presidential bid and market his UDA aspirants. Some of the Constituencies the DP team is eyeing are Kasarani, Roysambu, Kamkunji, Dagorreti South, Lang’ata, Embakasi South, Embakasi North, Embakasi Central and Embakasi West.
