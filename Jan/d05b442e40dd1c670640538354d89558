National men’s team Morans will assemble today to start training for the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 qualifiers. Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) secretary Ambrose Kisoi disclosed that the sessions will start after Covid-19 tests. “The training will be held at Nyayo Stadium between 8pm and 10pm. The players will also sign a code of conduct,” Kisoi said. Kenya are in Group ‘D’ alongside DR Congo, Egypt and hosts Senegal. The three-day tournament is slated for Dakar between February 25 and 27. Kigali-based tactician Cliff Owuor, who handles APR of Rwanda, and Thunder’s Sadat Gaya, will handle the side at the tournament. Meanwhile, University of Nairobi Terrorists and Kisumu Lakeside have vowed to continue their good run in the play offs. UoN coach Eugene Genga said they will prepare adequately for Game Two after upsetting Equity Bank 71-67. “It was a tough game. Equity are a top side with lots of stars. We had a game plan which the boys executed well and we stole Game 1,” said Genga. “They are now wounded so we expect them to regroup and come out hard on us in Game 2.” Kisumu Lakeside are coming to put their playoff series against national champions Ulinzi Warriors to an end. According to coach Dismas Oketch, Game Two is the most important match in the series. Lakeside beat Ulinzi 73-61. “We are looking forward to putting this series to an end early. In as much as we will be on the road, a Game 3 is the last thing we want,” he said.
