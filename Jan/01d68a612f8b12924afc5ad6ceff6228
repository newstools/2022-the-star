President Uhuru Kenyatta has condoled with the family of former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende following the death of his mother Dorina Omukanda Marende. Mama Dorina Marende, 87, passed away on Monday night at a Kisumu hospital after a short illness. In his message of comfort to the Marende family, Uhuru mourned Mama Dorina, a retired teacher and cleric of the Anglican Church of Kenya, as a successful teacher, evangelist and matriarch who raised a generation of successful Kenyans. "Mama Dorina was a shining star in her community. As a long-serving teacher and cleric, Mama Dorina raised a generation of highly successful Kenyans who continue to contribute to the progress of our nation," he said. Besides her exploits as an educator and evangelist, Uhuru remembered Mama Dorina as a woman of great faith and influence whose success can be seen through her family and benefactors. "Mama Dorina belonged to a rare generation of women trailblazers whose selfless service, deep faith and influence helped set a firm foundation for our country's progress through the years," the President mourned as he wished the Marende family God's comfort as they come to terms with the demise of their matriarch. "To my friend Hon Kenneth Marende and your entire family, I pray to God to grant each one of you comfort and fortitude to bear the loss of your beloved matriarch," he condoled.
