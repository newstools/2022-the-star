France has asked its citizens who are in Kenya to be vigilant while visiting public places. It said that there is a real risk targeting public places frequented by foreign nationals, particularly in Nairobi. In a statement released on Thursday, France said that restaurants, hotels, places of leisure, shopping centres are among the targeted places that should be avoided by its citizens. “Therefore, people in Kenya are advised to exercise extreme vigilance and avoid frequenting these public places in the coming days, including this weekend.” Last year, France said that the conflicts over land and drought have escalated in Kenya in recent months, north of a line from Kitale to Garissa, causing victims among the local population, but also the evacuation of certain areas welcoming tourists. It listed the counties of Samburu, Isiolo, Laikipia, Meru, and Baringo as the most affected, and that travelers should be more vigilant while visiting them. “Travelers planning to visit these counties are recommended to inquire about the situation with their tour operator or place of accommodation beforehand.” It continued that: “…particular vigilance, in the current context, must be exercised for any travel to the west of Laikipia County, in the areas of Rumuruti Town, Kinamba, and Ol Moran. For the record, it is not recommended to go north of the Kitale / Archers' Post / Garissa line, unless there is an imperative reason.”
