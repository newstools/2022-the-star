Rationing will be necessary if residents of Nyahururu and environs and the Aberdares fail to conserve the environment to prevent water levels from dropping further. That's what Nyahuwasco MD Peter Mwangi and other officials said on a tour of water projects in Nyahururu subcounty. He said company will be forced to reduce the supply of water to rural areas of Mairo-Inya, Nyandarua, Rumuruti, and Laikipia University so it can supply water to the town's population. He said the company spends about Sh2 million to clean the water before distribution. Mwangi said the quality of water at the intake was so bad and polluted that they are using more and more chemicals. "It is sad we are using more chlorine and other chemicals than before. This shows the quality of water we are getting from our source has gone down, leaving us with no option. We are receiving less water and it is of bad quality," Mwangi said. Laikipia county commissioner Joseph Kaniri cautioned against environmental degradation that has caused water levels at Thompson's Falls to drop drastically in recent years. Drought is not to blame, he emphasised. He said felling trees, pollution and bad practices of cultivation along the riparian land and riverbanks has reduced water levels at an alarming rate. "However much we want to blame the dry weather, we have to accept that we have bad practices as well, which have greatly reduced the quality of water. We have polluted our rivers which in turn has reduced the amount of water we receive here," Kanyiri said. The chairman of the county development implementation and coordination committee said the Nyahururu Water and Sanitation Company had received Sh1.2 billion from the African Development Bank to expand  infrastructure. He said that if the environment is not conserved, such a big project may not realise optimal benefits as a result of dwindling waters at the intake at Thompson's falls. (Edited by V. Graham)
