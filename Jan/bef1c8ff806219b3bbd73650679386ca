A man has died while another sustained injuries after the motorbike they were riding on was hit by a car in One Kenya Alliance's motorcade in Machakos County. Machakos subcounty police commander, Moss Ndiwa, said the incident occurred along Kyumbi-Machakos road, a few metres from Montezuma Monalisa Funeral Home on Saturday. The vehicle involved in the accident is said to belong to one of the senior politicians who accompanied Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and his KANU counterpart Gideon Moi to OKA's voter registration mobilisation exercise at Mulu Mutisya Grounds. The incident happened when the motorcade was headed to Machakos town for the event. "The incident happened between Lysak Hotel and Montezuma Monalisa mortuary when a vehicle in the politicians' convoy hit a man on a motorbike and his passenger, " Ndiwa told the Star on the phone on Saturday, a few hours after the incident happened. The police boss said one of the men died at Machakos Level 5 Hospital where they were both rushed for medication. He said the body had been removed to the same hospital's mortuary awaiting postmortem while the injured man was admitted at the same facility where he was receiving treatment.
