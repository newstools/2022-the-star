Twenty students from Kisumu Boys Hight School will benefit from Sh200,000 donated by the institution's alumni association. The donations was made to the needy and bright students to aid them in payment of their fees. Kisumu Boys High School Alumni Association president James Aggrey Mwamu said the first batch of the funding will benefit 20 students. Addressing the students while presenting the cheque at the school, Mwamu said the association will soon give more funds to help more needy and bright students get an education. He said most of the beneficiaries were from the informal settlements. On the unrest that had been witnessed across schools in the country, the alumni thanked the school head for ensuring that such were not witnessed within the institution. “We want to sincerely thank the principal of Kisumu school and the entire teaching staff together with students because this is one of the schools within Nyanza region that did not experience unrest in term two of last year,” he said. Mwamu also urged the government to avail funding for putting up infrastructure within secondary schools in preparation for the Competency Based Curriculum transition to secondary school next year. The school's principal Peter Obuogo lauded the move by the alumni and urged them to continue with the gesture of helping needy learners. “I have been in many schools but what I am seeing here is different from what I have seen in other schools where the alumni come back and give back to the school.” He assured that only genuine needy and bright students will benefit from the donation, adding that most students in the school come from humble backgrounds. “We look forward to receiving more because we know Kisumu school is an institution whose catchment area is from the slums and most of the students we have come from needy families, they are well behaved and they want to be in school.”    -Edited by SKanyara
