Harambee Starlets and Vihiga Queens goalkeeper, Lilian Awuor, is hours away from completing her dream move to French top tier side ASJ Soyaux-Charente. A statement shared on Vihiga Queens' social media page confirmed Awuor's departure, adding she had boarded a plane to France on Tuesday night. The hawk-eyed custodian landed the plum deal with the French club following her stellar performance at the Confederation of African Football Club Champions League in Egypt. A good number of Vihiga Queens' players have attracted considerable interest outside the country following the team's impressive run at the Cecafa Zonal Qualifiers in Nairobi and the Caf Women's Champions League in Cairo, Egypt. Awuor, 24, rose to prominence after bagging the ‘woman of the match’ gong in their 1-0 loss to South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns where she pulled off some world-class saves. The three-time Kenya Women's Premier League title winner becomes the latest player to grace the European stage after Essy Akida, Mwanahalima Adam and Dorcus Shikobe.
