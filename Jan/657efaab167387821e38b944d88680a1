A Nairobi court has issued a warrant of arrest against businessman Jimi Wanjigi. The court further issued summons to his wife and five others accused of conspiring to commit forgery. Milimani Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi directed Wanjigi's wife Irene Nzisa, Himanshu Dodhia alias Velji Premchard, Kaneez Noorani, Mohammed Hussein and others to appear in court on Monday. The prosecution, through investigating Officer Patrick Maloba, had requested the court to have the arrest warrants issued against the accused persons. He said he intends to apprehend the accused persons and bring them to court. He said police has tried to reach out to them, but their phones are switched off. He also said he wants other government agencies to assist in arresting the suspects. But the magistrate considered the application filed by the police and said that all other accused persons might not be aware that they are required in court. He noted that the accused persons were not bonded and so they need to be summoned. According to the charge sheet, Wanjigi and seven others are accused that between April 9, 2010, and June 5, 2018, at an unknown place within the country, conspired to forge a title deed for a land under the name of Horizon hills limited. They face another count of forging the title deed for land measuring 0.3314ha under the name of Dodhia Foam Limited, purporting it to be a genuine and valid deed issued and signed by a surveyor G.S. Gitau. The eight are also accused of forging a grant contrary to law on the same dates and place. The case will be mentioned on January 24.
