The body of a 54-year-old fisherman was on Thursday retrieved from Lake Victoria after he went missing on Wednesday. Michael Osano was killed by a hippopotamus at Alum Beach in Kayoo West, Homa Bay county. Osano went fishing on Wednesday evening but failed to return home. His family members who got worried started looking for him on Thursday. The family joined fishermen in search of him and later found his wrecked boat. The searchers then located and retrieved Osano's body. It had serious injuries inflicted by hippo bites. Speaking on Friday, West Karachuonyo Beach Management Unit chairman Samuel Osendo said the hippo overturned Osano's boat during the attack. “The hippo broke the deceased's legs and removed his internal organs before it disappeared into the water,” Osendo said. He expressed concern over frequent hippo attacks at the beach calling on the Kenya Wildlife Service to intervene and curb the human-wildlife conflict. Rachuonyo North deputy police commander Nelson Omwenga asked fishermen to avoid operating in areas invaded by hippos. The officer thanked residents for standing in solidarity with the family during the search. “The family reported the matter to us and the body has been found in bad shape due to injuries inflicted by the wild animal,”  Omwenga said. The deputy police boss said he had liaised with the Kenya Wild Service to handle the matter. “They have gone to the ground to assess the situation so that appropriate action can be taken,” Omwenga said. He urged residents to be careful when using the lake to prevent human wildlife conflict. The body was moved to Kendu Adventist Mission Hospital mortuary. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
