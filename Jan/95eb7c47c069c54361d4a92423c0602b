East African Community Secretariat has applauded the leadership and governments of Rwanda, and Uganda for their efforts towards re-opening of the Gatuna-Katuna border post on January 31, 2022. In a statement on Friday, EAC Secretary General Dr. Peter Mathuki hailed the move, terming it as a boost to regional integration. Mathuki noted that strengthening bilateral ties between the two partner states will revitalise social, economic, and political relations. “Re-opening this strategic trade route is in line with the provisions of the EAC Common Market Protocol and is set to accelerate economic and social development of the Partner States by reviving the free movement of goods, persons, capital, and labour,” Mathuki said. Mathuki said that the re-opening of the border would also promote peace and security across the region. “The move is a reflection of the deep commitment and existing goodwill among the EAC Heads of State to widen and deepen cooperation in the bloc, particularly as the Community expands with the anticipated entry of the Democratic Republic of Congo.” He also said that the community is committed to supporting initiatives that promote regional integration within East Africa. “The Secretariat is ready to provide any technical support that may be required to ensure sustainability on the movement of goods and services across all the borders.”
