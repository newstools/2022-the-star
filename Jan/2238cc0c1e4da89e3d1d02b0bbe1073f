The protracted two-year power feud at the Law Society of Kenya came to a screeching halt on Thursday with the formal ousting of Nelson Havi as the society's president. The chairmen of the society’s regional branches also took over as the new council of the lobby with lawyer Linda Kiome- Gitonga getting elected as the president. Gitonga is the chairperson of the Mt. Kenya branch of the lobby. Havi has since given up the fight for the position and is now focused on his Westlands parliamentary seat bid. He has also been part of Deputy President William Ruto's campaigns in the UDA party. Under the banner of branch chairs caucus, the eight-member team now becomes the substantive outfit to man the lobby whose running has been a theatre of violence and drama. Other members of the team caucus include Mathew Nyabena (Coast Branch), Justus Mutia (South Eastern Branch), Eric Theuri (Nairobi Branch), Sussy Rautto (West Kenya Branch) and Joshua K. Martim (North Rift Branch). Others are John Ochang’ (Rift Valley Branch) and Wilkins Ochoki (South West Branch). Nyabena is the new vice president of the society. They replace vice President Carolyne Kamende, council members Herine Kebita, Esther Ang’awa, Aluso Ingati, Carolyne Mutheu, and Faith Odhiambo. Others are Riziki Emukule, Beth Michoma, Berhard Ng’etich, George Omwansa, and Ndinda Kinyili. The action by the regional bosses follows a High Court ruling on December 20 that ordered the Havi council to convene in 21 days to attend to the affairs of the society. -Edited by B. Marita
