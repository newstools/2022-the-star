There are three Kenya Basketball Federation fixtures to watch as play offs quarterfinals continue this weekend. With five teams seemingly having a clear path to the semi finals, the direction of three matches in the three-game series could be determined on Sunday. A tough tie pits national champions Ulinzi Warriors against the visiting Kisumu Lakeside. The soldiers lost Game One 73-61 away and must come out firing or relinquish their title. Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) will host Eldonets Platinum at their Makande Welfare Hall. The porters won away 86-66 and remain favourites. Equity Bank face University of Nairobi Terrorists in a cracker. The campus lads won the opening tie 71-67. Strathmore University Blades were cut in the two regular season fixtures by Thunder, but Tony Ochieng’s boys regrouped to humiliate their rivals 68-39. The only ladies' match up that was not a one sided affair was the showdown between Storms and University of Nairobi Dynamites. Liz Okumu, the UoN floor leader struggled in that 47-31 loss where storms Dee Dee Were and Jemimah Knight had a solid game. Women top seed Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) had too much offensive power for Strathmore Swords easily winning 67-27. A sweep is in the offing. Women champions Equity Bank whipped Africa Nazarene University (ANU) 73-36 and should be too strong for them once again. Zetech University Sparks should also be home and dry against Eagles Wings whom they ruthlessly torched  62-29 last week.
