This nice, rich, and creamy delight will definitely knock your socks off. Gelato is an Italian frozen dessert that is so easy to make. It's better than ice cream as it has fewer fats and a distinct richness. The sweetness and flavour of both the mangoes and bananas are just perfect for this recipe especially if you're looking to not use a lot of added sugar. Ingredients Method In a blender, add the bananas, mangoes, and 100ml of milk and blend giving it a few pulses till you get a creamy smooth texture. (Squeeze half a lemon into the mixture and pulse for a few seconds. Bananas tend to change colour quickly,  the lemon helps stop that) In a cooking pot over low heat, pour in 100ml of milk and heavy cream and bring to boil. For the slurry, add sugar, the cornstarch and pour in the remaining 100 ml of the milk in a small bowl and whisk till the corn starch and sugar dissolves. Pour the slurry into the boiling pot and stir slowly, allow it to simmer for a few minutes till it starts to thicken. In a bowl add in the yolk and whisk vigorously, scoop some of the boiling mixture and temper the egg (this prevents you from cooking the egg yolk by slowly pouring a bit of the hot mixture into the egg and whisking it) Continue pouring the rest of the mixture into the egg yolk bowl, mixing till everything is fully blended. Using a sieve, strain the blended fruits into the cream mixture and stir generously. With a hand mixer, mix the cream mixture for 2 minutes, it helps with giving the gelato a smoother and velvety texture. Put 2 tablespoons of your spread of choice (whether chocolate or strawberry) in a small container and microwave for 1 minute. Transfer the mixture into a small airtight lid container then pour the chocolate spread into the mixture, making swirls using a wooden skewer. Let the mixture sit in the freezer for a minimum of 4 hours. After freezing, your gelato is ready to be enjoyed as you please.
