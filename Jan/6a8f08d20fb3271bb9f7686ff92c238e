Alex Nderi, alias Dj Lithium, will be laid to rest on Friday. The spinmaster lost his life inside the Capital FM offices on January 19. His postmortem was done a day later. Family and friends are congregating at Kahawa Sukari for the funeral planning and meeting every day from 4pm. The 33-year-old will be buried in Embu county at his parents' home in Mugwambogo village, where a graveside funeral service will be held. The family mourned him, saying, "He was a nephew, cousin, uncle and friend to many. Those we love live in our hearts forever." One of the DJ's colleagues, Nadia Favre, described him as spectacular. "Alex was a kind, gentle and creative man. A patient producer and spectacular DJ. I will miss seeing his face every morning. Rest in peace, DJ Lithium." Lithium described himself as a 'music lover'. He is known for having a bias for RnB to hip hop, but his strength and passion were in playing EDM and Afrohouse. He was also a producer on the radio station and hosted various gigs in top urban venues in Nairobi. In high school, he loved chemistry and hence decided to use Lithium as his stage name.
