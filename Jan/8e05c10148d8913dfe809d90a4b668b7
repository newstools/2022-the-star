Sensational gospel singer Christopher Nyangwara Mosioma, alias Embarambamba, had another opportunity to entertain ODM leader Raila Odinga on Thursday in Kehancha stadium, Migori County The artist is well known for his unique dancing styles when he performs on the stage. The ODM leader was moved by the artist's performance, so much so, that he took to his social media handle to question where Embarambamba came from. “Lakini kusema ukweli, huyu  Embarambamba anatoka county gani? Enjoyed my day in Kuria, Migori County,” Raila said. Embarambamba, who was dressed in a blue dotted suit has lately had chances of gracing Raila's events. During the launch of the Azimio la Umoja convention event at the Kasarani Stadium last month, Embarambamba was among the invited artists to entertain the people. The artist left hundreds of Azimio supporters in disbelief when he disappeared from the stage. Raila was in Migori county on Thursday to drum up support for his bid ahead of the August 9, elections. He was accompanied by his wife Ida Odinga among other ODM leaders.
