Mayfair Holdings Limited was established by the late business mogul Gilani in 1967 for economic development in the region. Munira Gilani, the Holdings Director, however, noted that Peche Foods was an establishment to advance the economic development of the Lake Region and provide jobs to many young people in the region. "Our main target was from the fishermen and women, delivery people and factory personnel," Gilani said. She said the collaboration is a milestone and they are happy to be part of the inaugural flight for the export this weekend. "We are optimistic that the export project will broaden the region's horizons further in both human and capital terms and achieve greater status and economic development for the region and the nation at large.” Kenya Airways is set to lift 1.8 tonnes of dress green chili on Saturday evening to the outside world.
