TikTok has become the internet sensational app that has positively impacted the lives of content creators. The social media app has become one of the most used apps globally, especially during the Covid -19 pandemic period. According to Google, TikTok became the most downloaded app with over 656 million downloads, overtaking Instagram with 545 million downloads. As more netizens download the app to overcome boredom, TikTok content creators have benefited from the creators' fund, a system used to pay the creators after hitting a certain level of views, likes, comments or shares. Not giving out the actual amount, the creators' fund has promised to help out creators investing in over $1 billion into paying them to earn a living. Speaking in an interview with Netflix for the show Hype House, Thomas Petrou, the co-founder of Hype House, who has over 2.1 million followers on the platform, says that the Hype House management employs TikTok creators to just produce content for their social media platforms and in return, the creators get to be paid by the company, mortgage and luxury living already taken care of. Larri Merit alias Larray, currently a former member of the Hype House, tells the story of his upbringing from a humble home with just his mother and grandmother before starting a YouTube gaming channel for the video game Roblox, which ended up landing him into the Hype House. For stars like Charli D'Amelio, who happens to be the most followed person in the app, her life changed for the better after doing a couple of viral dance trends on the app. She currently has 130.4 million followers. She was the first creator to reach 50 million followers on the platform, which she achieved in only seven months. Depending on your interests, the app also provides safety guidelines to protect very explicit content from reaching the eyes of the unintended audience, hence it is safe for your children to use the app freely.
