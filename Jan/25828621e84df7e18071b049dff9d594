Ugandan rapper Gereson Wabuyu, known as Gravity Omutujju, says people will die if the Ugandan government doesn't lift the ban in the entertainment industry brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking to NBS TV, the rapper said, "I have a music launch in February dubbed 'Tusimbudde 2022'. If the entertainment sector’s ban is not lifted on the 24th as the President had promised, we are going to take poison, hang ourselves and die." Adding, "Some of us are choking on heavy debts. You see even the shoes, watch and outfits I am clad in, I am still being demanded for some payment." In his New Year's speech, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said the performing arts, concerts, bars and discotheques will be opened two weeks after schools open on January 10.
