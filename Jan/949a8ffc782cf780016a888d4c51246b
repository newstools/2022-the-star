In every electioneering period, politicians emerge with different styles of campaigns and fresh manifestos in their bid to woo voters to elect them. The style of campaign and the candidates vying for the top seat especially the presidency plays a big role in influencing how people will participate in the polls. Some might take part in voting when one of their own, in terms of tribe, stands a good chance to clinch the top seat. However, others are never interested in politics and they would keep off from campaigns and even voting exercises.
