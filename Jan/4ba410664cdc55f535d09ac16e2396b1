A family in Embakasi’s Tassia estate is mourning after their three-year-old son was abducted by his biological father and killed in cold blood. In the sad incident that plunged, Nancy Adhiambo and her husband Christopher Okeyo into mourning, DCI boss George Kinoti stated that Adhiambo’s former husband Victor Ayieko, 30, had sneaked into their house in Tassia estate and left with the boy before he killed him and hanged himself. Adhiambo and her husband had left in the morning to fend for the family, and when they returned home in the evening, they found their son missing. Kinoti added that she inquired from her neighbours on his whereabouts and learnt that a man whose description fitted her former husband had been seen leaving with the baby on a motorbike. "They immediately rushed to Ayieko’s house in nearby Mukuru kwa Njenga. And when they broke the door, they found the baby's lifeless body was found sprawled on the suspect’s bed and Ayieko’s body hanging on an electric cable close by," Kinoti explained. A suicide note from Ayieko and Sh500 were found on the table, instructing Adhiambo to buy airtime worth the amount and inform the entire family of his demise. Owing to the increased cases of missing children in city estates, Kinoti urged parents and guardians to guarantee the safety and security of their children by leaving them in the hands of responsible adults whenever they are away. Report any case of child disappearance or abuse to DCI’s Anti Human Trafficking and Child Protection Unit for action.
