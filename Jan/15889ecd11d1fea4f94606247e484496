Discovery Kenya Cross Country Championship champions Daisy Cherotich and Robert Kiprop are among 1,500 athletes who will be in attendance at the 31st edition of the annual competition set for this Sunday at the Eldoret Sports Club. With no other races across the country this weekend, race director David Letting says they are expecting a bumper entry. “This will be one of the most competitive races now that we don’t have any other race across the country,” said Letting. The long-serving coach, however, admitted it will be challenging to host such a big field of runners from across and beyond the country, many of who will be using the event to prepare for the Agnes Tirop Memorial World Cross Country Tour. The one-day — named after 2015 World Cross Country champion Agnes Tirop — will be held on February 12 at Lobo village, Eldoret. “Some athletes may use this big challenge as part of their preparations for the World Cross Country Tour following the conclusion of the national cross country. But as a team, we are well prepared for big events and the challenges of hosting such a large number of athletes,” he said. This year, there will be only four categories unlike in the past when the championship used to have ten categories. They include the 10km senior men and women, 6km junior women and 8km junior men. Categories that have been scrapped include the under 15, under 10, and under 6 years, which were used as a way of promoting and nurturing young talents. “This year, we will only have a few races because most young children are in school and the issue of coronavirus is still with us so we need to protect these young people,” said Letting.
