Vihiga county has signed an overdraft deal with Equity Bank to avoid salary delays caused by late disbursement by the National Treasury. Alfred Indeche, the finance executive, said the deal will enable them to pay county workers their dues on time, in case of delays by the Treasury. He said the county has been battling with salary delays that most of the time originate from either the Treasury, Controller of Budget and sometimes county Public Service department. Indeche said when the county was struggling with pending bills, the Controller of Budget made it mandatory for counties to allocate the amount of money set aside for pending bills. “After allocating the funds, CoB still blocked us from accessing the money,” he said. “At the county level, the public service department sometimes failed to hand in the payroll on time. Such mistakes should not occur in the finance department.” He said it’s not their wish to delay funds but the challenges they encounter. Indeche said the court was another disaster, people with selfish interests blocked county funds through daily cases. “Let the public service department up their game to ensure all workers get their payments on time with the Equity Bank deal in place. No delays will be witnessed,” he said. The executive said December payments were made on time, however, people did not want to disclose if they had received their dues. Indeche dismissed claims by the county secretary Ezekiel Ayiego that they were not complying with Governor Otichillo’s directive of paying workers before Christmas. He urged Ayiengo to counter check the entire system before making claims. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
