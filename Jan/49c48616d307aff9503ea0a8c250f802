Tigania East MP Gichunge Kabeabea has urged the state to stop giving false hopes to ODM leader Raila Odinga. Kabeabea dismissed th alleged cooked presidential results showing Raila will win if he gunners 30 per cent of Mt Kenya votes. The MP said it was a big blow to Raila's bid after losing his perceived strongholds, especially in Western, Northern and Coastal regions to Deputy President William Ruto after Musalia Mudavadi joined Ruto's camp. He spoke on Saturday at Kirumone Primary and Kiguru Secondary school in Mikinduri where he laid the foundation stone for Sh7million to construct classes. The MP urged Raila to prepare for and accept defeat during the election. “Raila is known as a leader who does not accept the will of the people. DP Ruto is generous to those faced with disasters and fundraises to build churches,” he said. “They say Raila needs only 30 per cent but Ruto has captured and has support here. ” Kabeabea said the state has turned to threats and intimidations to MPs allied to Ruto because the Azimio la Umoja vote tally arithmetic to capture the presidency do not add up. “DP Ruto is not afraid of the dynasty, I am supporting him and confident he will win the presidency. We will never allow anyone to shed the blood of innocent Kenyans. He must accept the results,” the MP said. Kabeabea, who is facing competition from CS Peter Munya's foe turned ally Mpuru Aburi, asked Munya to vie for the governor’s seat. “I am seeking votes for a second term. I have no problem if the governor’s seat returns home,” he said. Munya was the first Meru governor serving between 2013 and 2017. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
