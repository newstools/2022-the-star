Tanzania actress Frida Kajala has warned gospel artiste, Ringtone, to stop sending her messages. Kajala also warned the artiste against sending messages to her daughter Paula Kajala, who is currently dating Rayvanny. "Nikome kunitumia messages na kumtumia mwanangu Paula Kajala. Wanaume wa Kenya sijui ni nini mbaya na nyinyi." Frida was last year dating Tanzanian star Harmonize. The relationship caused a stir online, given Kajala was much older than Harmonize. The two have since parted ways. Ringtone also tried to get with Diamond Platnumz's baby mama, Zari Hassan. Zari was however quick to turn down Ringtone's advances, something that left him with egg on the face. "I don’t know Ringtone and I have never met him. This is actually news to me. I have over 3.9 million followers on Instagram and I wouldn’t know who follows me."
