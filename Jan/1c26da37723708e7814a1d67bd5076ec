In case you did not know, onion googles do exist but now you will not need them anymore thanks to a new type of onion that won't make you shed tears. The race to develop a tearless onion dates back to 30 years ago. UK citizens will now officially get to shop the new sunions. Reports reveal that once harvested, sunions follow a tightly controlled flavour protocol and are tested throughout storage until they reach maximum tearlessness and peak flavour. It is until then that onion growers ship them to retailers around the country. More about the onion is linked on their website here. Sunions were developed for the first time in the US more than 3 decades ago and had been developed to cater for people with sensitive eyes and to make cooking easier and fun. Sunions are a brown variety with a mild flavour, ideal for cooking dishes just like the regular onions as well as salads due to their crunchy nature. The onion is certified tearless by both BASF and the Ohio State University Sensory Evaluation Center. Why the regular onion makes you tear “There are volatile compounds in onions that are responsible for tearing and pungent flavour. The amounts of those compounds remain the same or increase with time, but in Sunions, the compounds do the exact opposite and decrease to create a tearless, mild and sweet onion,” Alternative ways to prevent onion tearing If you cannot afford to look crazy when preparing that dish, you might as well freeze your onions before cutting for about 15 minutes. If you dunk them in cold water before chopping it can also help because cold helps prevent eye irritation by reducing the number of chemicals released through cutting. Another trick is peeling the onions and sprinkling a bit of salt before chopping away. The salt dissolves the Sulphur in the vapors.
