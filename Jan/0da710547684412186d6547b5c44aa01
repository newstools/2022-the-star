Kikuyu elders on Thursday endorsed Nairobi Assembly Majority leader Abdi Guyo for Embakasi Central MP. The elders under the Kiama Kiama umbrella endorsed the long-serving Matopeni MCA in a traditional Kikuyu event at Afro Sayari Hotel in Ruai. He has held the seat for 15 years. Guyo was first blessed by the Borana Council of Elders led by their chairman Ali Jilo before he was blessed by their Kikuyu counterparts. "Guyo has proved capable in work and that is why we elders have decided to bless him for the seat," Kiama Kiama Nairobi branch secretary Josephat Mwangi said.  The elders gave the aspiring MP an arrow, shield and traditional hide to symbolise their endorsement. Elders from all the five wards gave him symbolic keys to freely campaign throughout the constituency. "We have now blessed you and given you the go-ahead to campaign and knock on every door as you look for votes," Mwangi said. The elders then said a prayer while facing Mt Kenya. The endorsement sets the stage for a major battle for the seat held by Jubilee's Benjamin Mwangi. Mwangi will be defending his seat. Guyo expressed gratitude, saying he will focus on improving the lives of the constituents. "It's God's favour that has made this happen. I thank the elders and I am humbled. My focus, as always, will remain the people of Embakasi Central," Guyo said. The event was attended by many Nairobi MCAs, several elders from Kikuyu and Borana and residents of Embakasi Central. The MCAs promised to campaign for him until he becomes MP. "We as the people of Embakasi Central will not care about tribe. We want development," Kayole Central MCA Jeremiah Themendo said.
