Some elders from Suba North constituency have urged residents to reject politicians who cause chaos during campaigns. The elders said they would not want to witness any chaos. They spoke on Tuesday at Nyamasare social hall in Kasgunga ward Ahead of the 2017 general election, supporters of rival politicians engaged in fracas during campaigns. The two rival groups engaged in fights in Lambwe ward. One youth died. The elders urged residents to punish politicians who perpetrate violence and intimidation by rejecting them at the ballot. The members of the Luo Council of Elders led by Daniel Oketch and Ouma Otondo appealed to political parties to deny such politicians tickets. Other members were John Otieno and Elizabeth Atieno. “Let’s get rid of electoral violence promoters in Suba North by ensuring they do not win any party ticket and we don’t elect them as independent candidates,” Oketch said. The elders asked aspirants contesting various seats in the constituency to avoid interfering with activities of their perceived political opponents. Last week, supporters of rival camps engaged in a fracas during a football tournament at Urianda Primary School in Lwambwe ward. The tournament was organised by Water Secretary Samuel Alima. Oketch said they will not allow politicians to resort to violence to win votes. “Action should be taken against the people responsible for the chaos at Urianda,” Oketch said. Otondo asked the electoral commission and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission to take action against politicians accused of violence. “We’re ready to report politicians who cause violence because we know them. We don’t take sides but we are peace promoters,” Otondo said. Atieno asked youths to refrain from violence as they will be most affected should they elect bad leaders. “Peaceful campaigns will enable more women to venture into politics,” she said.
