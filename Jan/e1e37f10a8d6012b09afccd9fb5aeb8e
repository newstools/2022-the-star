Lugari MP Ayub Savula has said his bid to succeed Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya is still on. The lawmaker will face Ferdinand Barasa, Samuel Omukoko, Amukowa Anangwe and county assembly clerk Laban Atemba on the ballot. Others are Deputy Governor Philip Kutima, former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, incumbent Senator Cleophas Malala and Shinyalu MP Justus Kizito. “Most of these politicians do not have much political experience. They will not give me a hard time at the ballot,” Savula said. “Kutima has never won an election as an individual since he started attempting politics,” he said. Savula said Kutima tried three times to become Malava MP but failed. “Kutima lost Malava parliamentary election three times to Soita Shitanda (now deceased). Barasa is a political novice. I have been around and was elected twice with the highest number of votes in Western Kenya,” he said. Savula said he is prepared for the race and is optimistic that he will clinch the seat. “I'm supporting the Azimio la Umoja and we want Raila Odinga to take over from President Uhuru Kenyatta so that he can transform this country and revive our economy as he has said,” the legislator said. Savula abandoned ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi in December last year and said he would back Raila as President. The MP, however, clarified that he still remains in ANC that sponsored him to Parliament. "I have not defected from ANC, but I have today officially joined the Azimio la Umoja," Savula said. "I have also abandoned the One Kenya alliance, I am tired with that nonsense," he added.
