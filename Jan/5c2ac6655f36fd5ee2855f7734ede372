Left-back Dennis Wanjala is keen to cement his place at Kenyan Premier League side Nairobi City Stars. Wanjala, who joined Simba wa Nairobi from Nzoia Sugar, says he is fully settled and is out to aid the team to achieve its set objectives. He signed for Nairobi City Stars in September 2021 on a three-year deal taking up the slot vacated by Bolton Omwenga, who crossed the border to join Kagera Sugar in Tanzania. Wanjala is currently a regular at Stars, having started in their last 14 games. He has only missed the last four minutes of their match against AFC Leopards, in which he limped off injured. “So far so good. I am loving it here at Nairobi City Stars. When I arrived I was received very well and a few months later, I can confirm that I am fully settled at the club,” said Wanjala. “The environment at Simba wa Nairobi allows me to fully concentrate on my game and as the matches progress I hope to step up a gear and push the club to greater heights.” As he transitioned between Nzoia and City Stars, Wanjala was called up to the provisional Harambee Stars team for the away and home games against Mali in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. “That was a big call. I went to the Harambee Stars camp for a few days which was a first. Unfortunately, coaching changes at the national team followed soon after, and I am still waiting for a recall,” he said. “That is a platform I wish to play in, the national team. The right time will come but until then, my focus is to give 100 per cent at my club... be it in training or in competitive games.” Save for his astute defending, Wanjala is a dead ball specialist and even though he is yet to score, he says: “It’s just a matter of time, the goals are coming.”
