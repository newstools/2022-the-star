DCI sleuths have arrested a suspect wanted for defilement on Monday after engaging police officers in a cat and mouse game in Maragua, Murang’a county. Andrew Ngugi Wairimu, alias Makai, was cornered after escaping from lawful custody on June 4, 2021. The 20-year-old suspect had been arrested last year for gang rape and has two separate defilement charges, pending before Kigumo Law courts. Consequently, a warrant for his arrest was issued by the same court. Police officers who had been informed of Makai’s whereabouts ambushed him at the border area of Maragua township, but the machete-wielding suspect resisted arrest and attempted to flee. One of the officers engaged in the operation shot him on the left buttock, bringing to an end Makai’s six months of temporary freedom. The suspect is currently admitted at Maragua sub-county hospital under the tender care of medical personnel, who have since declared him out of danger. The Officer Commanding Station, Maragua, has assigned one officer to Makai’s hospital bed. The detectives in Murang’a South have taken up the matter and are preparing the suspect’s file to arraign him, immediately he leaves the hospital.
