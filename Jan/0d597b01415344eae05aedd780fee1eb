Two murder suspects wanted in the United Kingdom have been arrested in Nairobi’s upmarket Kilimani area. The two identified as Mohamud Siyad Abdihakim,24, and Tariq Kennedy Mangal, 21, were arrested by Transnational and Organized Crimes detectives following intelligence leads. DCI Director George Kinoti said Abdihakim was busted at AL-DAR apartments while his accomplice was seized from house No. A803 in Mideya Gardens, where they have been hiding since sneaking into the country in 2019. British officials have been looking for fugitives to answer to murder charges, after the brutal murder of a young man who was stabbed and left for dead in the U.K. The suspects are currently being processed at DCI headquarters before being extradited to the U.K to answer to their crimes.
