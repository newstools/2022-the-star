Gospel singer Smith Mwatia, popularly known as Rufftone, has revealed that his brother Daddy Owen almost attacked him with a machete in 2007. During an interview with NTV, Rufftone said, at the time, they were supporting different political parties. “In 2007, I remember very boldly my blood brother Daddy Owen was supporting ODM, and I was supporting PNU, and when we disagreed in the morning, Daddy Owen and his friends ran out to the streets with machetes targeting me,” Rufftone explained. When asked what is it about ODM that doesn't resonate well with him, Rufftone said, "there is a movement of hooliganism." "I came to believe that politics is about ideologies, and if we defer with you politically, you don't have to harm me, whether verbally or physically," he said. Rufftone is among celebrities who are eyeing various political seats. The artiste has declared interest in the Nairobi senator seat. "You are looking at the new incoming senator, Nairobi, Mr Roy Smith Mwatia. I will be vying in 2022 elections," he said in a past interview. Rufftone said he is particularly keen on empowering the youth, most of whom are jobless and immersed in antisocial behaviour. The singer has been in the music industry for more than 20 years.
