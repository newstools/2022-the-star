Kenyan Premier League debutants, Kenya Police, have acquired three seasoned players from rival clubs to bolster their squad ahead of the second leg of the top tier competition. Harambee Stars left-back David Owino headlines the star-studded transfer list that has also roped in former Kariobangi Sharks skipper and centre back Eric Juma and youthful Mathare United custodian Job Ochieng. Owino experienced a splendid run with KCB in the preceding season, guiding them to the runners-up podium after finishing behind winners Tusker. Juma has been a key feature in the Sharks lineup for close to two decades now, having also played a major role in their promotion to the top tier. This is the second time the law enforcers are plunging vast resources into the market to strengthen their playing unit after going on a similar shopping spree at the beginning of the season. They currently place ninth on the KPL log after five wins, five draws and an equal number of defeats.
