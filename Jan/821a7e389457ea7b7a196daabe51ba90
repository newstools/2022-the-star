Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has signed for reigning Asian champions Al Hilal, the Saudi Arabian club said on Sunday. The Nigeria international, who spent a year on loan at Old Trafford from Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, has signed an 18-month contract with the Riyadh-based club after a 12-month stint at Saudi rivals Al Shabab. The 32-year-old is currently the Saudi Professional League’s joint-top scorer, with 12 goals alongside Al Nassr’s Anderson Talisca. Ighalo replaces former France international forward Bafetimbi Gomis, who left Al-Hilal last week after helping the club win the Asian Champions League in both 2019 and 2021.
