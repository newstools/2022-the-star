The Metropolitan Police have launched an investigation into parties held in No 10 during the coronavirus pandemic. Commissioner Cressida Dick said they were looking into "potential breaches of Covid-19 regulations" in Downing Street and Whitehall since 2020. She said the investigation was launched as a "result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office inquiry team", led by civil servant Sue Gray. The Cabinet Office said Ms Gray's own inquiry would continue. But the BBC understands the report will not be published while the Met are investigating, and it is not clear how long the force will take. The news comes after fresh allegations of a birthday party being held for the prime minister in June 2020. Downing Street has admitted that staff gathered inside No 10 to celebrate Boris Johnson's birthday when the first Covid lockdown was still in place. But ministers have disputed the number of people attending, and called for "patience" while Ms Gray's inquiry is carried out to establish the facts. Deep concern Dame Cressida made the announcement about the police investigation while facing questions from the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee on Tuesday. She said she understood the "deep public concern" about the allegations of parties inside No 10, along with the "huge sacrifices" the public had made during the pandemic. And she said it would "not normally be a proportionate use of time" for the force to investigate rule breaches as far back as two years. But the commissioner said the police would look at allegations that "appeared to be the most serious and flagrant breach" of regulations. She added: "As a result of the information provided by the Cabinet Office and secondly officers' own assessments, I can confirm the Met is now investigating a number of events that took place at Downing Street and Whitehall in the last two years in relation to potential breaches of Covid 19 regulations."
