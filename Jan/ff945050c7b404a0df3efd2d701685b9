Alego Usonga parliamentary race has taken a new turn following the withdrawal of Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. The Governor, who had announced he will vie for the seat, pull out and endorsed his former employee Nicholas Kut for the seat. Speaking at a funeral in Alego Usonga, Rasanga said he will henceforth be channelling his efforts in ensuring ODM leader Raila Odinga wins the Presidency. “I will ensure that my party leader ascends to power by getting maximum votes in Siaya so that I become part of his government at the national level in any position that Raila will deem fit for me,” Rasanga said. Rasanga had become a formidable candidate as soon as he declared interest in the parliamentary seat owing to his financial muscles and close ties he enjoys with the ODM leader. The parliamentary seat is currently occupied by Samuel Atandi who is eyeing the second term. The MP appears to be out of favour among a section of leaders from the area who have also endorsed Kut for the seat. ODM youth leader Austin Ogolla faulted the MP for underdevelopment saying he has become a letdown to his constituents and youths who believed in him. “He has disappointed all those who thought they had elected a young leader to serve as an example to the coming generation,” Ogolla said. Ogolla further claimed Alego Usonga constituency has lagged behind in developments matters hence the need to change leadership. MP Atandi's tenure has been marred with a series of assault allegations pitting him against some locals. In January 2019, he was accused of slapping a Teachers Service Commission officer based at the Siaya office branch. Modester Anyuor, the victim, said Atandi stormed the TSC offices and demanded to get her boss' phone number. When she refused to share the number, Anyuor claimed, Atandi slapped her. In January last year, Siaya police launched a manhunt for MP Atandi for allegedly assaulting South East Alego chief Joseph Ojala. -Edited by B. Marita
