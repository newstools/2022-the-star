Sun's out all the more reasons to have happy hours at the comfort of your home. Cocktails aren't complex, just a matter of finding a blend that marries well with your favourites. Below is a recipe for a brilliant drink that’s not only visually stunning, incredibly tasty but has deliciously tropical flavours as well. This layered cocktail is a blend of coconut rum, pineapple juice, and orange juice. You can add grenadine so as it layers into the gradient of the colours of a sunset giving your drink more life. One might assume due to the juices it’s intensely sweet, but it’s sweetened just enough, with a fruity finish from the coconut. Ingredients : Method Mix the juices together into a nice blend, add in rum and stir. They’ll mix together because they’re all the same density. Slowly pour the grenadine into the middle of the drink. It'll sink to the bottom because it’s denser than the other liquids. Stir gently once to get the gradient effect. This helps the colours to blend a bit however, don’t stir too much or the drink will become one colour. Top with ice cubes and enjoy. Note: If you don't want to use ice cubes, refrigerate the juices and rum overnight before use. Enjoy
