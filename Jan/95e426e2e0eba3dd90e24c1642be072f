ODM boss Raila Odinga on the last day of 2021 received a major boost in his quest to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta after bigwigs from Western Kenya backed his 2022 bid. This came as Deputy President William Ruto's  attended football tournaments in Bungoma and Kakamega as the two continued with what is seen as early campaign ahead of the August 9 general election. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has committed to deliver a free and fair election. “As we reflect on the election processes, the Commission re-assures you of its commitment to delivering a free, fair and credible August 9th General Election,” said IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati in his New Year message. “The Commission is on course in planning and putting in place measures and mechanism to ensure a simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable, impartial, efficient, credible and transparent General Election,” added Chebukati. Speaking during the football tournament sponsored by Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala, Ruto asked Kenyans to reject leaders imposed on them by those who want to protect their wealth. The Deputy President took issue with those  purporting to decide on behalf of Kenyans, saying it's voters who have the final say on elections.He asked those imposing leaders on the people not to underestimate their capability to elect leaders of their choice. "Who told them that we do not have the brains to decide for ourselves?. Because they have money, they think they have the authority to impose leadership on Kenyans. No way," said Dr Ruto. Ruto went on:"Did you send anyone to represent you in hotel meetings where they are interviewing candidates they will endorse?" On his part the ODM boss accused Ruto of sleeping on the job for the last ten years, only to claim to have the magic to revive the region's sugar sector if elected in 2022. "He has been in government for all that time, why is he again promising to restore the economy and yet he is there?"Raila said.
