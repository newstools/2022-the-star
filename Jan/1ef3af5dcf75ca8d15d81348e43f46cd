 After week-long campaigns in Western and Rift Valley regions, Deputy President William Ruto on Tuesday took a short break. DP's Director of Communication Emmanuel Talam told the Star that the second in command had retreated to his official Karen Residence to review 'past events.' He said the break would give the DP an opportunity to engage with his advisors and strategists on the next campaigns. "The Deputy President is in Karen reviewing the past events and planning for the next campaign circuit," said Talam. However, Talam did not indicate the DP's next campaign programme. The DP has for the past one week embarked on a frantic charm offensive to market his presidential bid. He toured regions perceived as backyards of his presidential rivals to popularise his bid. For six days, the DP held campaigns in Vihiga, Busia and Kakamega counties and urged Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi to work with him. He also visited Trans Nzoia County and later Bomet and Kericho counties to woe the electorates.
