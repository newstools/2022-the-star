The UK Times newspaper quotes unnamed government sources as saying plans are being drawn up to send hundreds of migrants to countries such as Ghana and Rwanda for processing and resettlement. The Times says this is one of the populist policies being drawn up to save Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s embattled premiership after he admitted attending a drinks party during coronavirus lockdown - something he had previously denied doing. "Ministers are willing to pay hundreds of millions of pounds a year to any nation willing to take up its offer, although none has done so," the Times reports. Separately, the UN has warned against the nationality and borders bill that's being debated by UK lawmakers, because it says it increases the risk of "serious human rights violations" and does not respect the country's obligations under international law.
