ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has reiterated the need for Kenyans to enjoy the freedom of association and expression as enshrined in the constitution. The party leader spoke on Tuesday after meeting Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali and former Kakamega Senator Bonny Khalwale at his party headquarters. Their meeting comes days after DP William Ruto's UDA party and ANC agreed to work together ahead of the August 9, elections "The earthquake was real. The freedom of association and expression should be upheld at all times," Musalia tweeted. During the meeting, the three discussed issues of general importance ranging from political to the socio-economic welfare of the Mulembe nation ahead of the Friday mega rally set to be held in Western. Also, the meeting comes hours to the first UDA, ANC, and Ford-Kenya joint rally that will be held in Nakuru on Wednesday. Ruto has pledged to work with Musalia saying he will also partner with Ford Kenya and like-minded parties keen on uniting Kenyans. "We will work with ANC, Ford Kenya, and all other parties that want to walk this journey of bringing Kenyans together," Ruto said. "We are going to raise the bar and standards of leadership so that deceit and conman ship doesn't become part of the equation of leadership in Kenya. Kenya must belong to everyone and not a preserve of a few in power." The DP said the two will have to make sacrifices so that they can be able to drive the nation to the next level. The move by Musalia to work with Ruto has ruffled feathers of a section of leaders who have condemned him. Most of the leaders allied to ODM leader Raila Odinga have criticised Musalia saying he has betrayed the Luhya nation.
