Five family members who were killed in a road accident at Mackinnon area on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway were on Friday buried in an emotional ceremony at Nyakegogi in Kisii county. Emotions ran high as the bodies of Ronald Bundi, his wife Veronica Ogake, daughters Veronica Ogake, Marion Moraa, Natalia Kemunto, and Claire Kwamboka were lowered into a common grave which was partitioned by a brick wall at 4.15pm. They died on the spot when the car they were travelling in collided head on at Engwata Area at 4am as they were travelling to Kisii for Christmas festivities. Moraa, a form four candidate at Star of Sea in Mombasa, died one week after the accident while undergoing treatment at Coast General Hospital. Their two sons survived the accident and are undergoing treatment in Mombasa. They did not attend the funeral. They suffered fracture injuries on the legs and hands. Bundi was buried on the left side of the grave with his wife buried on the left side. The daughters were buried in the middle of the grave with the eldest from the left side. Kisii Diocese Bishop Joseph Mairura and the priest in charge of Amasago Parish Christopher Oira conducted the emotional burial service at Nyakegogi Primary School which was attended by thousands of mourners. Bishop Mairura and Oira paid tribute to Bundi whom they described as an ardent Christian. No speeches were allowed from politicians present. Roads and Infrastructure Chief Administrative Secretary Chris Obure was the only politician allowed to take to the podium.
