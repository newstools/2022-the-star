Schools across the country will officially be opened this week for the third term. On Monday, parents flocked into supermarkets and shopping centres to buy goodies for their children. In Kisumu, parents were seen in long queues at bookshops buying stationery for their children. Form four and standard eight candidates are expected to sit for their final examinations this term. However, a section of parents has decried lack of enough time to raise fees for their children since schools were closed for nearly two weeks for the December holiday. Some parents had earlier pleaded with the government to allow them more time to prepare for the school reopening but the Education Ministry said the school calendar cannot be altered.
