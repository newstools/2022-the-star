Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichilo on Tuesday cautioned boda boda operators against being misused by politicians ahead of the August polls. He urged the riders to remain vigilant and focus on their growth rather than the politics of the day that does not add value to their lives. Ottichilo urged the riders to empower each other through saccos. “You have done so well through your saccos.” “I'm impressed with your organisation, and you are the first boda boda operators to come up with ideas of identification to curb insecurity. Ottichilo said the move has helped reduce robbery with violence and cases of motorbike theft. The governor was speaking at Ebunangwe resort where he met riders from Emuhaya subcounty on Tuesday evening. Ottichilo said the boda boda sector has contributed a lot to Vihiga's economic growth. “We shall ensure you are operating in a good environment, good roads, sheds, and instal lights for those who operate at night to curb insecurity,” he said.
