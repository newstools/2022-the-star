There was confusion on Tuesday after two courts issued contradicting orders over the arrest of businessman and presidential aspirant Jimi Wanjigi. One of the courts issued an order for his arrest while another stopped the arrest pending the hearing of a petition that had been filed. High Court Judge Anthony Mrima issued conservatory orders stopping Wanjigi's arrest in a petition filed under a certificate of urgency. "It is hereby ordered that pending the inter-partes hearing of the Notice of Motion, conservatory order be and is hereby issued restraining the 1st and 2nd respondents from instituting, arresting, preferring, registering and or continuing any criminal charge (s) against any of the petitioners in reference to the parcel of land known as Land Reference Number 1870/11/200 comprised in Grant registered as Number I.R. No. 65800/1," Mrima said. The case will be heard on February 2, 2022. A Nairobi court had on Tuesday issued a warrant of arrest against businessman Jimi Wanjigi. The court further issued summons to his wife and five others accused of conspiring to commit forgery. Milimani Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi directed Wanjigi's wife Irene Nzisa, Himanshu Dodhia alias Velji Premchard, Kaneez Noorani, Mohammed Hussein and others to appear in court on Monday. According to the charge sheet, Wanjigi and seven others are accused that between April 9, 2010, and June 5, 2018, at an unknown place within the country, conspired to forge a title deed for land under the name of Horizon hills limited. They face another count of forging the title deed for land measuring 0.3314ha under the name of Dodhia Foam Limited, purporting to be a genuine and valid deed issued and signed by a surveyor G.S. Gitau. The eight are also accused of forging a grant contrary to law on the same dates and place.
