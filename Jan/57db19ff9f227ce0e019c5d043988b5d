A different way of spicing up those eggs is making that spicy masala omelette. With a combination of ground spices, chillies and eggs, your perfect omelette just works with a cold glass of juice or a hot chocolate or coffee. This dish whose origin is from Persia dates back to 1600. There are actually four types of omelette; American style, French style, Soufflé and Frittata. With a Frittata, this Italian dish involves additional ingredients such as meats, cheeses or vegetables. The word Frittata translates to “Fried”. A Soufflé is fluffy and soft, with a melted cheese center. The American omelette is slightly thicker with heavy fillings while the French omelette is thinner and slightly undercooked.
