Bruising battles are awaited in the Kenya Women's Premier League with six matches lined up for Match Day 5. Defending champions Thika Queens host Zetech Sparks at Thika Stadium hoping to build momentum following their 2-0 victory over Nakuru City Queens last weekend. Thika suffered a setback in their title defence with a surprise 2-1 loss at the hands of Bunyore Starlets in matchday two. Zetech will hope to bounce back to winning ways after two straight defeats with just a single victory to their name. Kayole Starlets will be looking to capitalise on Vihiga Queens' goalkeeping blunders when they host the county-sponsored side at Stima Club on Sunday. The three-time former champions Vihiga, have lost seasoned shot-stopper Lilian Awour to French side Soyaux Women Club on a three-year deal. Vihiga have kept faith win teenage sensation Sophy Akinyi, who conceded three goals from set-pieces in their 4-3 win but has received the backing of coach Boniface Nyamunyamu. Nyamunyamu confirmed Akinyi will be number one and starts against Kayole as the inform team is keen to maintain their perfect win record this season. The Cecafa club champions have garnered 12 points in four matches. Red-hot Bertha Omita who has been described as the 'missing piece' in Gaspo's attack is tipped to torment Kangemi Ladies in a David vs Goliath battle. Newbies Kangemi are winless and could be in for a trial by fire with the Gatundu based Gaspo in free-scoring mode. But even a win for Kangemi won't be enough to remove them from the bottom of the standings. Goals are expected at Mumias Sports Complex as Wadadia welcome Kisumu All Starlets Sunday. Wadadia have registered mixed results and their opponents are no better. Bunyore Starlets who are yet to lose at home (Mumboha grounds) entertain Trans-Nzoia Falcons. Falcons' coach Justine Okiring said his charges will be going for victory even though Bunyore are hard to beat at home. Elsewhere, Nakuru City Queens target Ulinzi Starlets scalp.
