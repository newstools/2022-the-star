All small political parties in Mt Kenya must unite ahead of the August polls for better bargaining power, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has proposed. He said the region can capture greater political power united than in fragments. Muturi, who is contesting for president on a Democratic Party ticket, revealed he has been speaking with other parties over the issue. He said the region was likely to be shortchanged or join the opposition if they will not be united. "As a region, it would be prudent for us to coalesce to one strong party like the DP in order for our strength to be felt," he said. He was addressing the party delegates in Limuru on Tuesday. The speaker noted that Mt Kenya people shouldn't beg to be included in any coalition. "We have the numerical strength and nobody should take us for granted. It hurt me when I saw some leaders on Monday begging to be given the deputy president position," he said. "Let whoever wants to court us, approach us. We shall then give our condition and those who will accommodate us shall be our partner". He revealed that DP will hold it's National Delegates Conference (NDC) on 21st February, 2022, when they will declared who they may work with. "If there will be no suitable coalition partners, we are not cowards and we can go it alone as DP. We are however ready to reach out to other parties with a view of galvanising our votes", he said. The speaker exuded confidence that the DP which was formed by retired President Mwai Kibaki will be the main political vehicle for people of Mt. Kenya. During the event, 300 delegates drawn from the entire Limuru subcounty endorsed and declared their support for Muturi's state house bid. The delegates led by Njenga Kinyenje said that they will conduct door to door campaigns aimed at rejuvenating the party and campaigning for the speaker.
