United States International University Africa’s Martials coach Tom Lagat is confident his side has turned the corner after recording their second win of the season. USIU narrowly edged Kisumu RFC 16-15 in a closely contested game on Saturday. Lagat said: “It was a very tough game against a very stubborn opponent. Kisumu came here to play but I’m happy we emerged winners. It was a game which would have gone either way.” He said his team has been struggling this season after losing many first-team players, who are yet to be replaced. “We lost some players in the transfer window and, unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity to sign replacements,” noted the tactician. “I’m currently rebuilding the team and I’m impressed by the progress. We are aiming at a top-five finish in the league since the gap between us and the four-placed team is just five points ahead of us." Next weekend, USIU will be up against Western Bulls which Lagat termed as a very strong side. Following the win, USIU moved to ninth on the log with 10 points. After matchday six, former Kenya Cup side Catholic Monks are still in the lead on the log with 22 points followed by Mean Machine while newly-promoted Shamas Foundation are third despite their 19-17 loss against Eldoret RFC. On Saturday, Catholic Monks narrowly edged University of Eldoret’s Trojans 11-9 while Machine defeated bottom-of-the-table Egerton University 5-3. Egerton Wasps have only played three games due to the closure of the university. Newbies Kabarak University recorded their third win of the season after a 15-0 victory over Northern Suburbs while South Coast Pirates thrashed former Kenya Cup side 21-8 in Ukunda.
