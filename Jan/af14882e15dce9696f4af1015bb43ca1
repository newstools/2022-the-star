Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo and his deputy James Gesami have dispelled rumours that they have drifted apart. Gesami said he is a political siamese twin of his boss Amos Nyaribo. The two spoke after a consultative meeting with supporters from West Mugirango at Viongozi Pastoral Centre in Kebirigo town on Tuesday. Gesami and Nyaribo reacted to social media speculations of an eventual break ahead of the August polls. The two held the meeting to confirm that they were still together and will defend their seat together in the next general election. They urged their supporters to have faith in them and help them re-clinch the county leadership. “I want to confirm to the residents of Nyamira that we (Nyaribo and Gesami) are siamese twins. Separating us is a very hard task which is life-threatening,” Gesami said. Nyaribo assured supporters that the rumours being peddled have no truth and those doing it were only determined to cause confusion among their followers. “Those who are selling such untruths should sell their agenda for the people instead of telling people lies. They have already sensed defeat, that's why they are so anxious about our candidature,” Gesami said. Last February, Nyaribo nominated Gesami as Deputy Governor. The move had the assembly deeply divided. The office fell vacant after Nyaribo was sworn as governor following the death of his predecessor John Nyagarama. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
