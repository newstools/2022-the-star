Two huge jumbos from Kora National Park in Tana River county have strayed into Kyandoo area in Kyuso subcounty of Kitui, causing fear among residents. Chief Jane Mwende of Kamuwongo Location, whose area of jurisdiction the elephants have invaded, said the beasts arrived in the night and were hiding in the Kwa Msee Panu thickets. “People are scared stiff and fear that the jumbos may turn wild and attack them. There are fears that the animals may proceed into people’s shambas and cause destruction. So far, there are no reports of any attacks or damage to crops,” the chief said on phone. Kyuso deputy county commissioner Reuben Kimosop confirmed that the elephants came from Kora National Park hundreds of kilometers away and travelled in the night only to be spotted in Kyandoo Village in mid-morning on Thursday. “I am aware of their presence in Kamuwongo area. We are asking members of the public to keep off and not to try and provoke them in any way as they are likely to turn wild once provoked. Efforts are being made to drive them out of the habited area," he said. “The Kenya Wildlife Service personnel are on their way to drive out the jJumbos from the midst of the people. I personally reached out to them and they promised that they would within a very short time arrive and goad them back to their Kora National Park sanctuary,” Kimosop said on the phone around 1pm on Friday. In May 2019, a lone jumbo strayed into the neighbouring Itivanzou village sparking fear among the residents as it invaded farms and devoured crops. However, Kenya Wildlife Service officers managed to corner it and drove it back to Kora. In 2016, a tragedy hit Kyuso location when a boy was trampled upon and killed by a stray jumbo. He was about to sit his KCPE exam at Gai Primary School when he met his untimely death.
