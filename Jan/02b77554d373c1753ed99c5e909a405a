A family from Kipkelion in Kericho County on Thursday identified two of the 21 unclaimed bodies at Yala Sub County Hospital Mortuary. The corpses are those of their relative, Philemon Chepkwony, 37, and one of his three friends with whom the former was travelling with in his car on the day they disappeared never to return. Chepkwony's family explained that their kin and the three friends had been kidnapped on December 2, last year. "Inside the mortuary, we discovered that he had been tortured and even identifying him positively at first was very difficult," Cheruiyot's brother, only identified as Meshack, said. The distraught brother of the deceased explained that his brother had been tortured severely. Many more families also trooped to the Yala morgue with hopes of finding their loved ones, after reports of unclaimed bodies in Yala emerged. Siaya County Health Executive Dismas Wakla said that Chepkwony's family has been instructed by the hospital to visit Yala Police Station, which has the legal custody of all the bodies, for the processing of their claim, of positive identification. Twenty of the corpses were allegedly fished out of River Yala; one of them being female and the rest male. As of today, all the 21 bodies still lie at the Yala Sub-County Hospital morgue and the facility is currently overstretched beyond its capacity. Yesterday, the office of Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai refuted that not 21 but 19 bodies are lying at the mortuary, having been retrieved from River Yala. Also, they said that the 19 bodies have been retrieved over a period of two years and are not recent events. The office of the IG also called on Kenyans with missing relatives to show up at Yala and help with identification. Edited by B. Marita
