The sister of slain Dutch tycoon Tob Cohen now wants the court to strike out applications by Sarah Wairimu in which she used the name Cohen. In an application filed in court, Gabriel Van Straten said Wairimu never adopted the name while married to the late Cohen. Gabriel claimed that Sarah Wairimu Cohen does not exist and is a fictitious person. “The applications filed before this Court as far and to the extent that they have been filed by one Sarah Wairimu Kamotho Cohen are incompetent and untenable in the eyes of the law for having been filed by a fictitious person and a person unknown to the law and us,” reads court papers. Through Lawyer Danstan Omari, Gabriel says her brother’s relationship with Wairimu had been strained before his death following numerous abuses against him by Wairimu that had forced him to seek divorce. Gabriel claims that for the time Wairimu was married to Cohen, she never adopted any of his names and never opted to change her name by way of a deed poll as is required by law. “Thus, the reference of herself as Sarah Wairimu Kamotho Cohen in the various applications filed before the court is meant to confuse the court by obscuring the mind of the court and seeking unnecessary sympathy or empathetic treatment from the court,” Gabriel says. She further claimed that using the name is also meant to make a mockery of the man and the family of the man she is accused to have brutally murdered and concealed his remains in an underground water tank.
