Schools on Monday began reopening for the Third Term that also serves as the homestretch to the KCPE, KCSE examination set to commence in March. The term is set to run for nine weeks to March 4 with no midterm break; and will sit as the shortest term yet. These will also be the last KCPE and KCSE examinations done outside the traditional November-December period as the school calendar normalises. Those in Class 7 and Form 3 will sit their national examinations between November and December 2022. KCPE will run between November 28 and December 1, while KCSE will be done from December 1 to December 23.
