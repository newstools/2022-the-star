Several passengers had in 2021 raised concerns against rogue online taxi operators. The passengers claimed there was an increase in the harassment cases reported and called on the companies to crack the whip on rogue drivers. Some of the drivers of the taxis also reported that they were harassed by the passengers. There was a trending hashtag on Twitter calling on people to boycott the Bolt taxi platform. The company responded by saying that it would employ female drivers instead to curb the number of harassment cases. They even introduced a Women Only option for its female users. But how safe are these taxis? The truth is, you need to be vigilant when using them because you can never be too careful. So how do you stay safe? 1. Ask the driver their name. Did you order a Bolt from a driver called John, but a driver called Judas showed up? Do not board the taxi, ask for John instead. 2. Do not board a taxi that you did not order. This is such a common concern that many users raised during the online rant against Bolt #DeleteBoltApp. If the car you ordered has a different number plate, do not board. Simple. 3. Share your live location. Share your location with friends and families especially when driving at night or for a long distance. Your loved ones will be able to track your movement to your final destination as well as know the number plate of the car you took. 4. Pay attention to your surroundings. If the driver takes a suspicious turn, ask them why. If you are on high alert, you can be in a better position to act in case something goes wrong. 5. Take the passenger seat. As much as it may feel wonderful to be chauffered around as you lounge in the back seat, you may want to consider the passenger seat. If the driver locks the doors, the passenger seat door can still be opened, for a quick escape. If you wish to jump out of the car when you sense danger, you have a better chance in the front seat.
