Comedian Oga Obinna thought suicide was a way to solve issues. He said he tried to commit suicide twice to no avail due to struggles. "I’ve made mistakes and I’ve learned many lessons. I’m below a lot of people and a lot is below me," he said. "However, patience, planning hard work, persistence, discipline, and consistency have played a major role. "Don't be afraid to experiment. A lot of people will tell you to stay in your lane or fall in line. You have to ask yourself who defines the lane, you or them? Be daring, be curious, be experimental, for nobody has the blueprint to live the perfect life." Obinna said that although some days will be tough, the sun will always rise. "It’s not easy to make it when going by the book. It will take time a lot of time," he said. "You will have pressure and be stressed or even depressed. Like me, you might opt for the easier way out of suicide. Don't do it, you will allow them to win." He said suicide leaves behind such a bad headache to the family that anyone considering it should think twice about that decision. "I repeat, don't ever think in this direction. It will not only not solve anything but also cause a lot of pain and suffering to those who love you," he said. "I’ve owned a couple of material things, from cars to houses to clothes to land, etc. This is what I’ve learned: Celebrate every win as it comes and don’t explain yourself to anybody," he said. "However, there is more satisfaction in giving than receiving. (Without others knowing — You posting, etc.)."
