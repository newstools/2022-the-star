Kiss FM presenter Kamene Goro has told fans not to be defined by their past. Speaking on The Morning Kiss, she said the hardest part of her life that she doesn't want to share with anyone is because of stigma or fear of being judged. "I realised I have been very aggressive in my life, ensuring that that traumatic past is something I was not going to carry into the person I wanted to be moving forward." Kamene let her traumatic past guide her into what she wanted to be and realised that people allow themselves to become victims of circumstances. "Life is hard. No one has had an easy life, we just don't say it. You need to make a decision on whether to be a victim of your circumstance or a product of your struggle. " Kamene highlighted abusive households, daddy issues and dating the wrong people as traumas that have made them victims of circumstances "I hear people say, 'I have daddy issues, trust issues.' You take traumatic things that have happened into your life and you've made them form your character. Now, I want you to take the traumatic things, find the lessons and let it guide you into the positive person you want to be," she said. "A lot of ladies have grown up in abusive households. And a lot of them walk around with that abuse they saw while growing up and let it manifest in themselves, as opposed to letting that inform the kind of man you want to attract. The kind of love you want." She concluded that she wanted people to turn negative experiences into positives. "If something terrible happened, big up to you for surviving. Now take the positive and implement it."
