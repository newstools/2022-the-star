Nyeri governor Mutahi Kahiga has urged county officers eyeing political seats in the forthcoming General Elections to resign. The Governor directed that officers with political ambitions to give a one month notice as stipulated in their contracts so as to ensure service delivery is not interrupted. "No one will be allowed to campaign while still working for the county government," he said. “I expect seamless coordination of all county activities even as we head into the elections. I ask the technocrats to remain focused on their jobs and leave the politics and the politicians to do their things,” he said. Kahiga spoke outside his office in Nyeri town on Wednesday when he announced cabinet changes in his government. Those working in government and willing to run for elective seats have until 9 February to tender their resignations according to the law. The governor said residents should not suffer because the country is in an election year. "They deserve full services rendered freely and justly," he said. Kahiga also urged his officers to redouble their efforts in service delivery. “Despite us being about seven or eight months to an election, we would wish that the government continues to run seamlessly without any unnecessary delays.” -Edited by B.
