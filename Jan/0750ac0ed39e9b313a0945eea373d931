Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday told off his competitors saying they have done nothing to warrant their election in the August 9, General Elections. Speaking in Embulbul, Ngong, Kajiado County, the second in command said Kenyans will vote based on a leader's track record. "Si mashindano ya urembo, ni mashindano ya kazi na kila mtu anapimwa na ile kitu amefanya," Ruto said, which translates to "This is not a beauty contest, it is a contest on one's track record on development" He noted that he and ODM leader Raila Odinga have had the opportunity to serve the country as Deputy President and Prime Minister respectively but Raila has nothing to show Kenyans on his tenure in office. Ruto called on Embilbul residents not to allow divisions propagated by a few individuals through tribal parties. "Don't let them divide us into tribal parties let us unite so that we can face our challenges as one," the DP said. From Embulmbul, the DP proceeded to Gataka, Ongata Rongai, in the same county where he passed the same message. Kajiado's visit came a day after he held a series of campaign rallies in Nairobi on Wednesday where he also drummed support for his bottom-up economic model. The DP told his opponents that he would not accept a government that prioritises leaders and leadership positions, adding that his government will focus on the people by solving their problems, including creating employment for the jobless youths. "Our priority number is to set aside Sh100 billion for housing, agro-processing, value addition and manufacturing to enable us create employment for our youth," he said. "I want to tell the youth, there is a relationship between your vote and your future, there is a relationship between your vote and whether you get a job or not." Ruto added that it is the duty of Kenyans to ensure they vote for the right people.
