An elderly man who was kidnapped last year in Murang'a county has died. Thomas Mwaga, 103, died over the weekend in Murang'a county. Mwaga hit the headlines when he was abducted by two men who wanted to rob him of his belongings. The two men lied to him that there was a deal that would make him earn Sh200,000. But he became suspicious and attempted to escape before they forced him into a car. The two men knew that Mwaga was in a Sacco and attempted to force him to withdraw the money at the Maragua branch. But on their way, Mwaga began greeting residents and even acknowledging others. This made the men panic and took him back to the car before they sped off. The suspects were later arrested and arraigned in court.
