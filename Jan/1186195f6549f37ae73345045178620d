Jackson Makini, popularly known as Prezzo, has announced his resignation from Kalonzo Musyoka's Wiper Party. Taking to social media on Tuesday, Prezzo shared an approved letter he had submitted to Wiper Secretary-General seeking his exit from the party. "I write to you to inform you of my decision to resign from Wiper Democratic Party of Kenya under section 14 (1) (a) of the political parties act as read with article 38 of our Constitution effective Monday," the letter read. However, Prezzo did not reveal the reason behind his resignation nor the party he will join next. Prezzo joined the Wiper Party in 2019. Prezzo at the time wanted to contest in the Kibra by-elections on November 7 but Wiper decided not to field a candidate because ANC and Ford Kenya supported them in the Embakasi South parliamentary seat. The by-elections were held after the Kibra seat fell vacant following the death of Kenneth Okoth who succumbed to cancer, leaving the seat vacant. He was succeeded by his brother Imran Okoth.
