Malala claimed he was speaking at the Eldoret rally on behalf of the Luhya community. "Ruto appeared at my football tournament in Mumias recently and I was passing through the Eldoret Airport and heard that he has an event here. I decided by come and greet him," Malala said. He also hit out at opposition chief Raila Odinga saying the ODM leader would not be elected as president come August 9, elections. "They are calling him the 5th but let me tell them that he will fail terribly." Malala said the Western region would stand firm and will not back Raila during the polls.
