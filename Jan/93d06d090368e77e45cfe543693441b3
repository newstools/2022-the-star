An MP from Nyanza has sent shivers down the spine of senior staff at county in the region after he said most of them will be rendered jobless after the 9 August elections. The MP, who will be contesting for governor, is also said to have vowed that contractors will also face the same fate. The legislator has been arguing that senior staff and contractors have been the reason the county has dragged behind in development. Staff who are being targeted are said to be putting together a dossier that will expose the rot in use of NG-CDF monies by the MP. ** An MP from a Western county elected on a party not dominant in the area surprised many when he recently defected to a new political outfit and not to the dominant party as was expected. The lawmaker known to go against the wave is now a target of his opponents and party luminaries who have swore to teach him a political lesson. The seasoned lawmaker has told his associates  he has the ground and is sure he will bag whatever seat he runs for on whatever party. As plan to cut him to size, the party structure in the area has been mobilised to preach six-piece voting pattern in the region, where having the dominant party’s ticket is as good as being elected. It is a matter of time to see if the MP will survive the party’s machination. ** A vocal lawmaker is on the horns of a dilemma on whether to seek re-election or retire ahead of August elections. People close to Mheshimiwa told Corridors that up to three opinion polls results commissioned by the lawmaker put him a distance third in a race where a philanthropist with foreign connections is touted as the favourite. The MP is now said to be planning to bow out of the race and join his party leader’s national campaign with the hope he will be accommodated in the next government, if his boss wins the high stake State House race.
