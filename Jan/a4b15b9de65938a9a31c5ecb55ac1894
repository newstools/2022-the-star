Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli was forced to come clean over the agenda they discussed with ODM leader Raila Odinga during their meeting on Sunday. Atwoli had posted a photo on his Twitter account meeting Raila, Governor Ndiritu Muriithi, of Laikipia, Junet Mohamed (Suna East), Senator James Orengo (Siaya), Jubilee Party vice-chairperson David Murathe, former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, and ODM Executive Director Oduor Ong’wen. According to Atwoli, they had an Azimio la Umoja consultative lunch meeting at his home in Kajiado County. Reacting to the photo, Senior Counsel lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi claimed that the crisis meeting was on cards after Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka openly declared he will not play second fiddle to second fiddle. Dismissing the case, Atwoli said that Kalonzo did not feature on their agenda items. “There was nothing like Kalonzo on our agenda items. Those are wishful thinkers and daydreamers,” Atwoli said. He added that the Azimio la Umoja have the numbers and that all have seen and come to that realisation. “I can assure you that you'll be among the few Kenyans who will be at home shedding premium tears come August.” This comes after Kalonzo insisted that One Kenya Alliance is intact and that they will name the flagbearer before the end of January. Kalonzo said he will be on the ballot as a presidential candidate in the August 9, 2022, general elections. He trashed the narrative that the presidential contest was a two-horse race between Deputy President William Ruto and ODM leader Raila Odinga. "The time is now; this is the time. I am running for the President of the Republic of Kenya, " Kalonzo said.
