Intimidation by opponents is to blame for the closure of United Democratic Alliance offices opened in Rongo constituency by Deputy President William Ruto. Rongo parliamentary aspirant on UDA ticket John Zatta told reporters the office has been closed for weeks because of intimidation from ODM leaders and supporters. “We are yet to find staff who are brave enough to be in the office. We are intimidated by ODM supporters since they have told us they don’t want blemishes,” he said. He was speaking following complaints that his high gear campaigns involving hefty donations to women and youth groups had run out of steam. However, Zatta refuted claims that he was running out of steam before official campaigns kicked off. He confirmed that he was under pressure and has been advised by doctors to take a bed rest after he was involved in an accident earlier this month. "My doctors told me to take a bed rest because my pressure was very high, and I had an accident earlier this year. But I will bounce back," he said. He said he will continue with his "political right and civic duty” of interacting with voters despite the intimidation. However, the  incumbent Paul Abuor elected on ODM ticket criticised Zatta, saying he “opened a hotel where voters were eating for free, but  the hotel is closed.” “Zatta's claims against ODM are unfounded, we believe in democracy and we will not intimidate our rivals,” he said.
