Kitui county received extremely high rainfall in November and December due to a sudden shift of Intertropical convergence zone meridional winds. County director of meteorology Daniel Mbithi said Kitui and parts of Makueni had exceedingly high rainfall. The western region experienced no rains or very little rains during the same period. The ITCZ winds ordinarily blow from South to North bringing rains to the Western, Rift Valley and Lake Victoria regions. However, the course shifted leading to the high rains in Ukambani. “The epicentre of the ITCZ situation was Kitui because it received the highest rainfall in Ukambani in November and December,” Mbithi said. Speaking on Thursday, he said the ITCZ meridional winds had since shifted to Tanzania causing a decrease in rains in Kitui since December 29. He was giving a brief about the ending October-December season. Mbithi, however, said some light rains were expected in parts of Kitui in the next three days up to Saturday. He said, during the October-December season, Kitui generally received an average of up to 350mm of rains, distributed across all parts of the county. “The lowest rainfall recorded in our stations was 236 mm while the highest was over 400 mm. This was good for all crops including short-season varieties of maize,” Mbithi said. “Those who made sure the sowing was done by the first week of the onset of the rains will get maize yields since the moisture is enough to help maize crop grow to maturity.” Mbithi said farmers who planted millets, mung beans and cowpeas will get yields. His office had given an advisory that the October-December rains would come late and last for about four weeks. Mbithi said he had toured all the Kitui subcounties two weeks ago and that there was enough pasture and water for livestock. “The previous fear that cattle would starve to death for lack of pasture has now ended,” he said.
