West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi has urged ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi to be DP William Ruto's running mate and form the next government. Their combined strength will deliver the presidency without a doubt, probably by 8am on August 9, he said. Kemosi spoke on Sunday at Konge PAG Church where he assured Mudavadi of an early UDA victory if he joins hands with the DP. "As long as we support you, we are sure we will have a government very early if you decide to join his camp," Kemosi said. Mudavadi did not comment on being Ruto's running mate. He said the ANC will reveal its way forward to the general election during the National Delegates Council meeting next week. "We shall give a major announcement on where we will be during this year's general election. At the same time, we are waiting for a way forward from the party leadership on where we will be heading as a party," Mudavadi said. Kemosi joined Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja, Nyamira Governor Amos Nyaribo, his deputy James Gesami and North Mugirango MP hopeful Nathaniel Mong'are in appealing to Mudavadi. Talk of peace and unity dominated the Sunday service as leaders called for peaceful campaigns. "As we go on with our campaigns, let all of us maintain peace and unity, let us not talk politics that can lead to violence. We are past that," Mudavadi said. (Edited by V. Graham)
