Police say investigations into their activities in the country has commenced even as they remain in custody waiting to be arraigned on Monday. Police have cautioned employers that it is illegal for any foreigner to work in Kenya without a valid work permit. In 2018, Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said that foreigners should apply for work permits from their home countries before seeking work in Kenya. The CS also warned that Kenya will not issue work permits to foreigners for jobs that can be done by Kenyans. "We will also not issue or renew thousands of permits to those people pursuing courses such as accountancy and tour guide courses, among others, which are taught locally," Matiang'i said. He asked stakeholders in the immigration sector to work together to improve the sector.
