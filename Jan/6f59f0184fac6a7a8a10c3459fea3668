United States International University-A Spartans' defender Lynn Mwangi will draw valuable lessons from the African Cup of Nations as she seeks to improve on her overall performance ahead of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) league next month. The former Kenyatta University Titans right-back was one of the several new faces to debut at the bi-annual continental tournament last week, playing in all four matches. While she remains a work in progress, the 22-year-old has vowed to punch above her weight in training to beat the stiff competition at the club. Mwangi was an ever-present member of the Jacquiline Mwangi team and grabbed her chance. "I am not the finished article yet but there's room for improvement," the energetic defender opened up. "Game intensity at Africa Cup of Nations was on another level hence the need for intense physical training. My mental strength has improved but I have to learn how to handle pressure and deal with zonal marking." The Kerugoya Girls' alumnus said she needs to be in peak condition and add intensity to her game if she is to nail down a regular spot. Phanice Teka is currently the first choice. "My target is to be 100 percent fit.  I am not yet there. I am looking forward to a better performance in Kenya's net assignment. The competition is fierce in training and that pushes me to my limit." On her dream debut, she said: "There's no better feeling than marking your beginning with a win. It was a privilege to proudly don the national colours and I felt I did a good job." The KHU league is set to return in mid-February following a two-year hiatus due to Covid-19 pandemic.
