Seasoned tactician Ezekiel Akwana has stepped down from his role as Mathare United head coach, the club announced on Friday. Akwana's resignation comes barely a day after his charges suffered a humiliating 3-1 defeat at the hands of AFC Leopards at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. “Mathare United have on Friday, January 21, parted ways with head coach Ezekiel Akwana,” read a statement issued by the club late Friday. Francis Xavier has been appointed on an interim basis, with his first real test being the reverse fixture against AFC Leopards at Nyayo Stadium on Sunday. “Akwana stepped down from his role following a run of poor results and will be replaced on an interim basis by his immediate assistant Francis Xavier,” the statement read. Akwana, who experienced a glorious career with the Slum Boys as a player, failed to inspire the side to a decent position on the log after succeeding Frank Ouna at the start of the season. Unlike Akwana, Ouna proved to be the toast for the club after salvaging them from the jaws of relegation in the preceding season before he left to pursue a coaching role outside the country. Akwana watched helplessly from the touchline as the fortunes of the Slum Boys continued to take a dip. They sit in a precarious position on the log with a paltry seven points from 15 matches. Pundits interpret the move to part ways with Akwana as a last-ditch effort aimed at turning around the club's dwindling fortunes. The Slum Boys are currently second from bottom of the table with a paltry seven points following a string of consecutive losses in their recent league outings.
