The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati has called for peaceful campaigns, in his new year message to Kenyans. In a statement on Friday, Chebukati called on Kenyans to support the Commission and campaign peacefully during the electioneering period. "We must always remember our collective responsibility to ensure a peaceful, free and fair election in August 2022," he said. The IEBC chairman also announced that the electoral body will begin the second phase of the Enhanced Continuous Voter Registration (ECVR) and diaspora voter registration in January. "We therefore urge all eligible citizens who are yet to be registered as voters to turn up at our registration centers for enrollment," Chebukati said. He reassured Kenyans that IEBC is committed to delivering a free, fair and credible General Election, on August 9. Chebukati added that the commission will continue engaging relevant stakeholders to ensure the same is achieved. "The Commission is on course in planning and putting in place measures and mechanism to ensure a simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable, impartial, efficient, credible and transparent General Election," he said.
