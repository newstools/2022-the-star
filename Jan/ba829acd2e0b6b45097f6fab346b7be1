Men and youths in Kisii have been urged to seek counselling to curb the high number of suicide cases reported last year. Concerns have been raised over the high number of men and young people who die by suicide. Ruth Mogaka, a counselling psychologist at the Kisii Teaching and Referral Hospital, said 14 men and youth died by suicide in Nyaribari Chache constituency. “Cases of men and youth who committed suicide is worrying. There is a need for them to seek counselling services,” Mogaka said. Addressing men and youth from Matunwa and Kiogoro, the counsellor said several cases reported were due to depression, financial constraints, land issues and family disputes among others. According to statistics from the World Health Organization, more than 800,000 people die by suicide every year worldwide. Kisii Central deputy commissioner Wilberforce Kilonzo advised those with psychological challenges to seek counselling services. Kilonzo said his office will work closely with health experts to curb suicide cases. “Committing suicide will leave a negative implication on their families,” Kilonzo said. “They need to understand that such acts will leave their families isolated and stigmatised.” Kilonzo said some men take alcohol to avoid taking parental responsibility and providing for their children. He warned that his office will work with the law enforcers to carry impromptu crackdowns and arrest those involved in the illicit business. “I warn those who are engaging the brewing of changaa that their days are numbered. Those who be arrested will be taken to court and slapped with hefty fines,”  Kilonzo said. He said brewing and consumption of changaa has ruined many families and some children have dropped out of school and marriages broken. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
