About 50 girls from the Minawao refugee camp from the far-North of Cameroon shared a special moment with CAF President, Dr Patrice Motsepe at Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua during the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations. The girls, who are part of the football time at Minawao camp, watched Nigeria/ Sudan and Egypt/Guinea-Bissau matches and got an opportunity to see some of their heroes in action. This is part of a partnership between CAF and UNHCR, an Agency of the United Nations Refugee Agency that aims to use football - Africa’s most powerful platform and prime entertainment - to bring hope to the continent and vulnerable people. CAF understands the influence of football - as Africa’s most popular sport - not just to be a source of entertainment but a catalyst for social change in the continent. President Motsepe was joined by CAF Vice Presidents, CAF Secretary General, Veron Mosengo-Omba and a team of referees led by Victor Gomes, who officiated at the match between Nigeria and Sudan. Minawao Camp is located in the Far North region of Cameroon and has been operating for a number of years. UNHCR’s primary mission is to safeguard the rights and well-being of people who have been forced to flee. The agency works alongside its partners and communities to ensure that everyone has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another country. UNHCR also strive to secure lasting solutions.
