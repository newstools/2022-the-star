Oxfam International, a global charity organisation, has listed Sameer Naushad Merali as Kenya’s top tycoon with fortunes worth $790 million (Sh89.6 billion). Sameer is the heir to the late businessman Naushad Merali. Bhimji Depar Shah, the founder of Bidco Group of Companies, is the second wealthiest with fortunes of $750 million (Sh85 billion). According to Oxfam, the two individuals control more wealth than what 16.5 million Kenyans own. Also ranked in the top five are textile manufacturer Jaswinder Singh Bedi at $680 million (Sh77.1 billion), President Uhuru Kenyatta with a fortune of $530 million (Sh60 billion) and Mahendra Rambhai Patel with a fortune of $430 million (Sh48.7 billion). The Charity organisation said Uhuru's wealth is likely associated with the wider Kenyatta family.
