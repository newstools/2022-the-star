With the Kenya Premier League season heading into its halfway stage and their title defence faltering, Tusker assistant coach George Maina has challenged the team to give the fans a good performance and good results. Robert Matano's men are 13 points behind league leaders Kakamega Homeboyz, albeit, with a game in hand. “We owe the fans big time because they are behind us all the time and they want good results,” said Maina. “Now it is time for us as the technical bench to go back and see what we can do to improve the cohesion and the consistency in the team and do everything possible to give the fans the wins they deserve,” said coach Maina on the brewers official portal. He added; “We will go back and re-organize ourselves and try to come back stronger.” Last time out, Tusker dropped points away to basement side Vihiga Bullets with Maina disappointed that the performance couldn’t produce goals. “It was not the result we wanted especially coming from a win. We knew it was going to be difficult especially playing the same opponent. We could not counter the tactics they used and it was disappointing. “Now we just need to go back to the drawing board, back to the basics, and try to prepare well for the next assignment,” he concluded. Tusker emerged second behind Shujaa in the Team of the Year category during the 2021 Sports Personality of the Year Awards (SOYA) staged at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega. This followed their successful campaign in the 2021 season where they clinched their 13th Kenyan Premier League title.
