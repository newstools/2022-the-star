Menengai Oilers have bolstered their squad by signing five players in the mid-season transfer window. Gibson Weru has brought in Kenya Simbas scrumhalf Samson Onsomu from Impala, Simbas' prop Coleman Were from Kabras, Eugene Lubanga from Western Bulls alongside Albert Obura from Strathmore Leos. The quartet played a part in Saturday's 16-15 win over Quins which saw the Nakuru-based side go top of the log with 24 points and Weru said the best is yet to come from his charges as they chase a first-ever Kenya Cup title. “It was a tough win against a quality Quins side. Our new signings will come in handy as the season goes along and we are going all out for the title,” said Weru. Weru noted the signings will create depth in the side to match the likes of champions KCB and Kabras. "This is a long season and with the Enterprise Cup still to come, we must be prepared with a deep squad to challenge the frontrunners," he noted. In a see-saw contest against the Ngong Road outfit, Geoffrey Ominde scored a last-minute penalty at the ASK Showground in Nakuru to keep their unbeaten run in the league. Bildad Ogeta and Steve Ochieng scored a try each for the hosts with Timothy Omela adding a penalty as Melvin Thairu and Johnstone Mungau scored a try each for the visitors with Domin Osino added a penalty and a conversion. Oilers lead 8-5 at halftime. Champions KCB heaped more misery on winless Impala with a 47-0 drubbing at the Lions' Den. The bankers remain fourth on the log with 16 points, but with a game in hand. Veteran Andrew Amonde scored a brace with Isaac Njoroge, Peter Kilonzo, Oscar Simiyu, Mike Kimwele and Manasseh Oduor scoring a try each. Darwin Mukidza scored three conversions for the bankers. Strathmore Leos bounced back from their shock defeat to Nondies a fortnight ago to edge Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology 25-24 as Homeboyz picked their second win of the season, beating Nakuru 33-15 at Jamhuri Park.
