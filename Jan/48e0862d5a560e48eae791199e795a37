Tanzania National Assembly speaker Job Ndugai has resigned. In a statement to media houses on Thursday, Ndugai said the decision to quit are personal and he was not coerced in any way. He said he had written to his party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), over his decision to resign as Parliament speaker. "Naomba kutoa taarifa kwa umma wa Tanzania kuwa leo tarehe Januari 6, 2022, nimeandika barua kwenda kwa katibu mkuu wa chama cha mapinduzi kujiuzulu nafasi ya spika wa bunge la jamhuri ya muungano wa Tanzania," Ndugai said. This comes barely three days after Ndugai apologised for his remarks on Tanzania’s borrowing from external sources. Speaking at a public rally in his Kongwa constituency in Dodoma on December 27, Ndugai said that Tanzania should stop accepting loans from external lenders and instead expand its domestic revenue streams to pay for development projects. His remarks attracted uproars within the ruling CCM party forcing Ndugai to retract his comments. “It was just a call to Tanzanians to accept taxes, levies and such government charges as a necessary part of increasing internal government revenues to help cover costs for social services such as health, education and the like,” he said.
