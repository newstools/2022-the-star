Lakers tactician Austine Tuju has said the team can sparkle in the Kenya Hockey Union League after their players played a starring role in Kenya's run to the semifinals of the Women's African Cup of Nations in Ghana. The Kisumu-based side had Aurelia Opondo, twin sisters Alice and Maureen Owiti, Vivian Onyango and goalkeeper Millicent Adhiambo at the week-long event that ended on Sunday. The Jacquiline Mwangi-coached side managed a bronze at the rescheduled biannual show. Opondo scored twice in the group stages as Kenya defeated Zambia 3-0 and also sounded the board in a 2-1 come-from-behind win against Nigeria. Onyango was a mainstay in defence while the Owitis' staking claim of their slots in the national team with positions up for grabs in the on-going rebuilding. "The players should be proud of their performance. We've come a long way but hard work, patience, resilience and determination has paid back," Tuju observes. "The motivation is much greater than what I can put in words. The reward was worth the struggle and the sacrifice, being a self-sponsored club. This kind of achievement never comes easy." Lakers finished fourth in their top-tier debut in 2019, hardly dropping points at home. Tuju said the players should be confident ahead of the new season, starting mid-February, challenging them to go for the national title. "The players have come of age if their accomplishments at ACN is anything to go by. We are going for nothing but the Premier League andI believe we have what it takes," said Tuju. "The players and the management are committed to this goal. We have to continue improving because Lakers had the youngest squad in the league in 2019."
