Gospel singer Rose Muhando has explained why she wants to date a rich white man. Last week, the single mother of three said she was tired of being single. In an interview with Tanzanian blogs, Muhando said she wants a mzungu who will spend on her and not leave his fortune to dogs. "It's my choice. I don't want a mzungu just because he's light-skinned, but I want the one who will give me money," she said. "May God give me a rich mzungu who will spend on me and give me his money to spread the gospel of God. "Marriage is by luck, I can't go around looking for a man to settle down with but by praying to God, He will give me one." The 'Nibebe' hitmaker said that is her major prayer item this year.
