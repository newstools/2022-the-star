Former Laikipia North MP Matthew Lempurkel was charged afresh with hate speech on Thursday. This is after the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji amended the charges against him by introducing an additional charge of hate speech. The former legislator was accused that on July 17, 2021, within the country, while on a television show, he made hateful remarks against a community. The prosecution said the remarks caused ethnic hatred in Laikipia County. He faced another charge of uttering abusive and threatening remarks against another community on the same date. Lempurkel denied the charges before Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi. His lawyer Saitabao Kanchori pleaded with the court to grant his client lenient bond terms, saying he is jobless. He also pleaded with the court to retain the cash bail terms he was granted on September 9, 2021. The court released him on a cash bail of Sh150,000. The case will be mentioned on February 16.
