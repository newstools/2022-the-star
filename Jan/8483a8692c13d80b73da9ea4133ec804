This is honestly one of my most favourite vinaigrette. It has a rich nutty flavour with hints of sweetness and tangy undertones as well. Vinaigrette is a concoction that consists of multiple ingredients like sugar, lemon juice and oil and balsamic vinegar as the base. The mixture can be enhanced with salt, herbs and/or spices and is most commonly used as a salad dressing, but can also be used as a marinade. It's not only easy to prepare but doesn’t require a lot of time in the kitchen as well and goes well with fried meat dishes. Ingredients Method In a blender, add the peanuts and 1/4 cup vegetable oil then give it a few pulses. In a small bowl, add the rest of the ingredients and mix them well. Pour in the vinegar mixture into the blender with the peanut mixture, and give it four pulses. Transfer the mixture into a bowl and stir well, it should have a runny consistency. In case it's too tangy and thick, you can add two tablespoons of water into the vinaigrette then stir. Garnish with some lime zest, salt and pepper then transfer the vinaigrette into a clean mason jar for storage. Serve it with your favourite salads or chicken dish.
