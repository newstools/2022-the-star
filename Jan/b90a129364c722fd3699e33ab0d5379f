Blueberries are high in potassium and vitamin C, which help in boosting immunity by strengthening one’s metabolism. A 1/2 cup serving of blueberries contains 25 per cent of the recommended daily value for vitamin C and 3 grams of dietary fibre. You will definitely need a strong blender for this. Ingredients 2 cups of blueberries 2 lime, juiced ½ cup of water 3 cups of ice Preparation Step 1 Pour all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth. Step 2 Garnish with a slice of lime.
