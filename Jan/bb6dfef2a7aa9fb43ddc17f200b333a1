Speaker Justin Muturi has explained why he did not attend Musalia Mudavadi's presidential launch at Bomas on Sunday. "We were surprised that DP William Ruto would attend and Mudavadi did not have the courtesy to inform us," Muturi said. Via Twitter on Monday, Muturi said this made them feel very suspicious of what they would declare. "....and correctly we have seen the formation of another coalition with WSR, which we have never discussed at any time," he said. Muturi boycotted the function even as Mudavadi's OKA allies made face at Bomas. However, when they heard that Ruto was going to appear at the Conference, they decided to storm out. Shortly after leaving Bomas, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi hastily announced their political divorce from Musalia, saying it's time to end what they termed “nasty political games”. “We have to part ways since some of his friends are not our friends and we are unsafe with them. We are therefore moving to higher political grounds where Kenyans are safer...we would like to wish Hon Mudavadi the best of luck as he joins his other partners,” the duo said in a statement. Sources said Kalonzo and Gideon will join Raila's Azimio La Umoja Movement.
