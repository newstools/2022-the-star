A Bahraini national was Friday detained at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport after he was found carrying at least Sh107 million as he tried to fly to his country. Khalid Jameel Saeed was carrying the money in bags from Nairobi when he was stopped as he tried to board an Egyptian airline headed to Manama. Officials at the airport said, based on intelligence shared by Financial Report Centre, the Kenya Revenue Authority, Customs and Border Control staff at JKIA passenger terminals intercepted the male passenger. They said he intended to take a flight to Bahrain through Egyptian Airline and was carrying $975,000 cash which is about Sh107 million at exchange rate of Sh110. The alert was that the passenger had earlier made several attempts to deposit the currency in a bank but had failed. And he then decided to walk with the money to the passenger terminal in efforts to leave. He was questioned and told officials he worked in Nairobi and was paid in cash. Saeed was freed Friday but his money was detained as officials investigate the source and motive. Police at the airport said they will issue further statement later. KRA officials said the matter is now being handled by different agencies. Officials at the airport usually recover many valuables from passengers intending to travel. The valuables include cash and ornaments. Officials said there is need for one to declare about such goods before he or she travels.
