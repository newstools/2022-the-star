Vaccination has been upscaled as schools reopen for Third Term this week, the government has said. Government spokesperson Cyrus Oguna said on Monday in a statement that expectations of parents and students are that this term will have minimum disruptions, particularly when it is considered that it is the term that will define the future and destiny of candidate classes. “As the government, nothing less is expected, and all measures have been put in place, including upscaling the vaccination programme, to ensure that there is zero disruption in school operations,” Oguna said. He added, “As we focus on this new term, we must remain conscious of the fact that these are unprecedented times. For the third year now, Kenya and indeed the rest of the world, continue to contend with challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.” Kenya in November last year opened up Pfizer vaccines to teens aged between 15 years to 18 years of age after data reviewed by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board found the vaccine to be safe for use in this age group. Meanwhile, Oguna said that critical lessons have been learned so far and that Kenyans must not blink or allow any lapses if they are to preserve the gains so far made in combating the Covid-19 pandemic, and build on them for more success. Even as the daily cases of coronavirus keep rising, Oguna said that the least anybody would want is a disruption of the school calendar due to rising infection numbers.” He also said that the government will prioritise the safety of all learners and the staff. “Therefore, we shall continue to collaborate with all stakeholders in the education sector, in ensuring that our schools remain safe, secure spaces to facilitate learning, as we collectively, as a people, continue to battle this pandemic.”
