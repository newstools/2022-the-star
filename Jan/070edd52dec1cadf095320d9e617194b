Posta Rangers youngster Steiner Musasia has insisted the best is yet to come from the mailmen after a run of three wins in ten matches put them well inside the Kenya Premier League title fight. Kenya Under-23 international cited cohesion within the Posta squad as well as the experienced coaching staff as the reason for their optimism this season. "We have started showing some consistency in our performances and results. That is a reflection of the work we are doing in training. The players are more united than before and that has brought a sense of brotherhood in the squad hence the positive results we are getting," he said. The proof that Stanley Okumbis's men had turned the corner after a slow start was evident after a 3-0 drubbing of serial title contenders and record league winners Gor Mahia. Steiner was keen to point out that it was just another three points. "For us, it was three more points but obviously when you win against a top side,  it gives the players a massive lift. However,  we must not dwell too much on this win but try to build on it and close the gap on the teams above us," the former Acacoro star remarked. From their fifteen games this season, Posta have amassed 25 points—eight less than league leaders Kakamega Homeboyz who have played a game more.
