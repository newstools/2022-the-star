National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has now said that he is not in any coalition talks with One Kenya Alliance (Oka) principals. Addressing the press after Democratic Party (DP) National Executive Council meeting at A Nairobi hotel, Muturi said Oka principals only visited to wish him well following his surgery. "The decision of me engaging other parties in coalition talks can only be made by the top decision making organ of DP. I cannot make that decision as an individual," Muturi said. With him were party leader Francis Munyao and officials from the branches. Munyao said the party will this week announce a National Delegates Congress were coalition matters will be discussed. "We will endorse Muturi as our presidential candidate and discuss matters about teaming up with like-minded parties," he said. He said DP will hold its NDC before the end of February. Muturi remarks comes barely a week after the OKA leaders namely ANC's Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula and former MP Cyrus Jirongo visited the Speaker and held talks. Baringo senator and Kanu party leader Gideon Moi missed the visit. Mudavadi hinted at an alliance with Muturi after he captioned the images of their meeting with Muturi with a cryptic message. "More to join... Big coalition loading... Obe Kenya loading... fishing you a quick recovery speaker Muturi," Mudavadi tweeted. While Kalonzo did not speak of an alliance with Muturi in his message on the visit, he endorsed Mudavadi's sentiments by retweeting.
