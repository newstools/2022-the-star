Tea manufacturers in the country are happy with reforms being done by the government to improve the sector. They said showcasing their produce outside the country will boost their sales. Maramba Tea Factory production manager Michael Kiarie said when the government participates in helping manufacturers to market their products, it motivates them to produce more and improve quality. "When we have a good market, our sales go up and we realise more profits," he said. Kiarie further said some European companies buy their products and use them to blend theirs before selling to their customers. "However, after much exposure, we hope we shall blend products which can be sold straight by the customers, without being re-blended, rebranded and repackaged," he said. He lauded President Uhuru Kenyatta for supporting factories that in turn are supporting the industrialisation pillar of the government's Big 4 Agenda. Kiarie also thanked the President and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta for organising a visit to the factory by the Hungarian First Lady Anita Herczegh. Hungary President Janos Ader and the First Lady arrived on Sunday for a four-day visit to the country. They later toured Maramba Tea Factory, and were taken round by the operations director Dedan Gichuru and the operations manager. Gichuru, who was the first African airforce commander, said the tour was aimed at marketing Limuru tea to Hungary. "We have never sold tea in Hungary. This visit means a lot to tea farmers not only in Maramba, but to the whole country. We thank our President for hosting such leaders," Gichuru said. He said Kenya tea is exported to Sudan, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and a few European countries. (edited by Amol Awuor)
