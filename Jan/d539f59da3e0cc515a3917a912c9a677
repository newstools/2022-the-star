Kenya's real GDP grew 9.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2021, National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani has said. He has attributed the growth to the easing of Covid-19 containment measures. While making the announcement, on New Year’s Eve, Yatani said: “Economic recovery from the effects of Covid-19 pandemic continued in the third quarter of 2021 as a result of easing of containment measures." The Q3 growth comes after an earlier impressive second quarter performance of 10.1 per cent of real GDP growth of 2021. “The easing of containment measures, saw a rebound in growth led by the education, accommodation and food serving activities, transportation and storage, manufacturing and insurance activities at 64.7%, 24.8%, 13%, 9.5%, 6.7%, respectively, " Yatani said. The CS has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to ongoing economic recovery efforts. “The 9.9% real GDP growth is testament that the economy is recovering from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and that the government’s interventions are working for the good of our people. I thank Kenyans for their hard work and resilience," he said. The results are contained in the Quarterly Gross Domestic Product Report by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) which also contains highlights from the seven sectors of agriculture, forestry and fishing, manufacturing, construction, electricity supply, transportation and storage; accommodation and food service activities and financial and insurance activities.
