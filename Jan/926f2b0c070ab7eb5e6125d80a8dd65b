The Director of Public Prosecutions, Noordin Haji has ordered investigations into Meru Senator, Mithika Linturi's remarks in Eldoret during Deputy President William Ruto's rally. In a letter to Inspector General, Hillary Mutyambai, Haji directed him to open investigations into the senator's remarks. According to the DPP, Linturi's utterances could incite contempt, hatred, hostility, violence or discrimination. "Pursuant to Article 157 (4) of the Constitution, I hereby direct that you immediately institute comprehensive investigations into the said allegation and submit the resultant investigations file on or before 14th January, 2022," Haji said. In a video seen by the Star, Linturi is heard saying "Sisi tunataka kuwa kwa serikali inayokuja lakini nawaambia watu wa Uasin Gishu msicheze na Kenya na kile nawaomba ni kwamba madoadoa yale mliyonayo hapa muweze kuondoa. Hatuwezi kuwa tukisimama na William Ruto kule Mt Kenya na mko na wengine hapa hawasikii na hawawezi ungana naye..." This loosely translates to, "We want to be in the coming government but I want to tell you people of Uasin Gishu not to play with Kenya and I am asking you to remove the spots you have here. We cannot stand with William Ruto from Mt Kenya yet you have people here who don't listen and cannot team up with him." His remarks angered Kenyans on Twitter including leaders who  came out  and strongly condemn the sentiments. Gatundu South condemned the remarks saying that Deputy President William Ruto should have rebuked Linturi's remarks. "I am a close friend of the Deputy President. However I am far. If you are in Eldoret and near hear tell him to rebuke this talk. It doesn't matter whether it is said by a Linturi or an Oscar Sudi. It matters that it is being said in Eldoret Sports Club, few kilometres from KAG Church Kiambaa in 'Burnt' Forest'. Jameni Madoadoa tena," Kuria said. Others leaders also condemned the remarks;
