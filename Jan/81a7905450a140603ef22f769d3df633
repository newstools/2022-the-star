Police in Murang’a South subcounty have seized narcotics worth Sh1.5 million at Kimorori-Wempa. The police received a tip-off from members of the public that a group of youthful criminals were using an abandoned building to package the drugs. Police commander Alexander Shikondi said officers raided the building only to find the 10-room building littered with drugs. They confiscated 25 brooms of bhang, 45 sachets of kuber, four 80gms tins of kuber, two 50gms sachets of kuber, 70 rolls of bhang, 4kg of bhang seeds and assorted bhang rolling materials. Shikondi expressed concerns that the drugs would have caused immense damage had they fallen into the hands of students who resumed learning this week. “I want to thank members of the public for giving us the information and security officers for taking swift action,” he said. Shikondi further said the police have the identities of the six youths involved. They are aged between 20 and 32. “We know their homes and will look for them until they are apprehended. We know all the tactics the criminals have been using to peddle drugs and have put dragnets along roads to nab them,” he added. The police will also go after the owner of the building, he said, as he should have known the activities going on in it in accordance with the Nyumba Kumi Initiative.  (edited by Amol Awuor)
