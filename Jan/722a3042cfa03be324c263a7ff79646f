Liverpool have made a formal request to postpone Thursday's Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at Arsenal because of an increase in Covid-19 cases at the club. The Reds canceled first-team training on Tuesday. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp missed Sunday's Premier League draw at Chelsea following a suspected positive test. Players Alisson, Joel Matip, and Roberto Firmino also missed the game while three members of staff tested positive. The Reds' squad has been further stretched by the departure of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Naby Keita for the Africa Cup of Nations. The request has been made to the English Football League (EFL) with the match at Emirates Stadium scheduled to take place at 19:45 GMT on Thursday. A Liverpool statement said: "Among the considerations which led to today's application to the EFL is the need for traveling supporters to be given as much notice as possible of any potential postponement. "With no prospect of the current situation improving ahead of Thursday's fixture and the potential for it to worsen, the club considers it both prudent and reasonable to ask for the fixture to be rescheduled.
