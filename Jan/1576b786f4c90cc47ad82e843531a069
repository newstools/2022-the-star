A Kisii businessman has been jailed for three months with an option of a Sh100,000 fine for maliciously damaging the gate to a disputed land valued at Sh335 million Chief Magistrate Martha Mutuku on Thursday sentenced the businessman Patrick Nyamweya after the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt the criminal charge against him. The magistrate noted that the prosecution witnesses found the accused person at the scene of crime saying he damaged the gate valued at Sh50,000 at the property located along Mombasa road. However, Mutuku acquitted the accused person on all other charges of conspiracy to defraud, making a false document and forged title deed after the state failed to prove the charges against him. The court also set free Nyamweya's  co-accused person Yusuf Moalim  Hassan for lack of evidence. The two had been charged with conspiracy to defraud Samco Holding Limited a piece of land. Nyamweya alone had been accused that on an unknown date and place jointly with others not in court, they had conspired to defraud Samco Holdings limited a parcel of land. Nyamweya and Yusuf denied the charges levelled against them. According to the charge sheet the land Nyamweya conspired to defraud is situated along Mombasa road measuring 0.009 hectares.
