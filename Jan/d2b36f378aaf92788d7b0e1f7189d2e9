Sauti Sol Singer Bien Baraza is quitting old habits, including jaba (a type of khat). In a social media post, Bien said he decided this after deep reflection. "So after a long hard look in the mirror, I have decided to change my ways," he said. "The Internet is a very toxic place and I just want to take a step back. There are a lot of habits that I picked up along the way that I am leaving behind this year. I just wanna reset and rewind. Thank you." Bien admitted that he knows the process is also not going to be easy. "Time to reset and rewind. From this day onwards, I am a changed man. I am even considering quitting jaba. It won't be easy but the Lord is with me."
