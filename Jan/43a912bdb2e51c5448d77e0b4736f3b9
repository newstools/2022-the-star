 When Egypt enter the field on Wednesday to face Sudan in the third and final matchday of Group D at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium, victory will be the main objective for the Pharaohs, who need just three points to ensure their progress to the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations. It will be a match that pits two countries with a well-known and historic rivalry against each other. After losing their first match against Nigeria (1-0), the team led by Portuguese Carlos Queiroz got their first win, after beating Guinea-Bissau thanks to a solitary goal from Mohamed Salah. The Egyptians have three points, behind the already qualified Super Eagles (six), followed by Guinea-Bissau and Sudan with only one point. Mathematically, the three teams have a strong chance of booking a place in the next round. Seven-time champions (1956, 1959, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2008 and 2010), Egypt lost in only two Afcon finals. One in 1962, to Ethiopia, and the second final was, more recently, in 2017, against Cameroon. Otherwise, Egypt will be looking to consolidate their hegemony. This will be the sixth meeting between Egypt and Sudan in the tournament. In those clashes, the Egyptians hold a three-match advantage over the Sudanese. Their first four meetings took place between 1957 and 1970, while their last head-to-head dates back to 2008, with Egypt winning (3-0). In their first meeting in Khartoum (1975), the Sudanese capital, the Pharaohs won 2-1. Sudan won the Afcon in 1970. Despite these statistics against the Jediane Falcons, Sudan know that they can create a surprise as other teams have done during this competition. A victory over Morocco would pave the way for a second or third place depending on the result of the game between Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau.
