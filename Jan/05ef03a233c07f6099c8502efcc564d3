Strathmore Leos coach Louis Kisia believes the signings of Maxwell Atera, Stephen Osumba, and Jerry  Olola will boost their chances of qualifying for the playoffs in the Kenya Cup. The trio's talent and experience will be key for the varsity outfit who are keen on qualifying for the playoffs for the second year running. Speaking Monday, head coach Louis Kisia said the depth in the team will be key as the race for the final positions intensifies. “We are entering a phase, where every team wants to survive the league or be in the playoffs. There will be no easy games and we must be prepared for tough fixtures," he added. The former Mwamba skipper saluted his charges for a hard-fought 25-24 win on Saturday against an improving Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology. The win saw them jump to second place on 21 points—three points behind Menengai Oilers Kisia's charges had lost to Nondies in their last match before the Christmas and New Year break and showed great character despite trailing 24-12 at one point to the Kakamega-based outfit. “I had faith that we could come back and they did not disappoint. We kept piling on the pressure and eventually we were able to win at the end,” he added. Try scorers for Strathmore were Bethuel Anami, Brunson Madigu, Andrew Matoka, and Gideon Makumi. Kisia said the side must avoid lapses in concentration that allowed their opponents to score tries. “ We have had lapses in matches against Nondies and MMUST. If we can reduce the error rate going forward, we can go all the way,” said Kisia.
