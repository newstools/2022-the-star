Gaspo Women’s team want to collect maximum points in their remaining five matches of the first leg to remain in contention for the national title, team manager Edward Githua has said. The Gatundu-based side became the first team to take a point from high-flying Vihiga Queens following their 0-0 drab draw at Mumias Sports Complex on Sunday. Gaspo are second with 13 points, three shy of leaders Vihiga. While there were positives from the weekend result, Githua has challenged the players to maximise on their chances in their quest for glory. “We have to work on our finishing. We had many chances but they were never converted. If we become ruthless in attack, we will have a real chance of winning all our remaining first leg matches. To be automatic champions, we have to win all our matches,” Githua said. “We want to minimise the gap with the leaders. Gaspo have finished as runners-up twice but this could be the season to win the title.” Githua, however, warned the players not to get carried away with their recent form. “Every match is treated differently. Results are unpredictable because favourites have been beaten by underdogs so it’s about not becoming complacent. The team used to concede goals from fouls but look better now,” he observed. Gaspo received a 51-bus seater last month from President Uhuru Kenyatta and this has acted as extra motivation. “Movement has been made easier and this will be a source of inspiration,” said Githua.
