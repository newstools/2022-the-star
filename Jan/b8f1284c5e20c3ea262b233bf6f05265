When it comes to crisps, I can eat them all day, all the time, especially on those days when my craving is at its peak. My go-to snack is salt and vinegar crisps because it's easy to prepare. Just a few ingredients are needed. The secret to making crisps is ensuring they are thinly sliced so that they can cook evenly. Otherwise, you end up with crispy sides and mushy middle. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 After slicing the potatoes and rinsing them in water, soak them in a bowl of apple cider vinegar for 1 hour. Ensure the bowl is covered. Step 2 Spread them out on a kitchen towel, then heat some oil in a pan Step 3 Drop the slices one by one, spreading them out to avoid clumping. Fry them for 1-2 minutes or until crisp Step 4 Remove from oil and drain excess oil using a paper towel Step 5 Sprinkle sea salt or any choice of salt for extra taste. Step 6 Dip in Ketchup and enjoy with friends.
