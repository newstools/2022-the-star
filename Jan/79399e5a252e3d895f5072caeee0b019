Jubilee vice chairman David Murathe has claimed President Uhuru Kenyatta ended his dalliance with William Ruto because the DP was out to sabotage his administration. Speaking in Thika, Murathe said that Ruto was given half the government including some of the most powerful ministries but the President was not satisfied with the way they were being run. The former MP said Uhuru decided to work with Raila to ensure what he wanted to deliver to Kenyans was actualised. Murathe spoke during Raila's Azimio la Umoja meeting with the people of Murang'a county. Deputy President William Ruto's spokesperson, Emmanuel Talam who spoke to the Star questioned why all these claims were not made before the 2017 elections. Ruto teamed up with Uhuru to win the 2013 general elections and joined hands again in 2017 to defeat Raila. "Ruto was a saint when they wanted re-election but became bad soon after! Wajinga waliisha Kenya," he told the Star on phone. In Murang'a, Murathe also disclosed that the Jubilee party will hold a National Delegates Conference soon, to endorse Raila as its presidential candidate. He also promised to reach out to other parties from the Mt Kenya region and ask them to join the Azimio la Umoja Movement. "In that National Delegates Conference we will ask our delegates to pass a resolution because in Jubilee we have no candidate and our candidate will be Raila Amollo Odinga."
