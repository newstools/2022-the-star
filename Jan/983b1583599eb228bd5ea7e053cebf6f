There are so many ways of preparing salads you can practically eat one every week and not exhaust them. Salads are versatile and inclusive of all diets. The egg salad is one of my favourite salads as it's easy to prepare and full of flavour. It also doesn't require dressing making it healthier with fewer calories. A meal loaded with love and goodness for your body. On top of that, you can curate the ingredients to your specifications. This meal is so filling you don't need anything else to go along with it. And the taste is purely scrumptious. Ingredients Method. Note: It's always best to wash your lettuce in warm water. Wash all your vegetables clean, shred the cabbage and carrots In a cooking pot, add the cabbage and carrots then scoop a little bit of margarine and add. Stir, cover, and allow to steam over low heat. After a while, branch the broccoli then add it, stir and cover allow to steam for roughly 2 minutes. Turn off heat and set them aside in a large bowl to cool. Chop the onions and tomatoes and set them aside. Note: To avoid the onions stinging your eyes, soak them in water before chopping or ensure you chop them near a mass of water or running water. Hard boil your eggs for 10-15 minutes. Set them aside in a bowl of cold water. Remove your lettuce leaves and shred the lettuce into desired sizes with your hands. Chop the avocado into small cubes and set them aside. Remove the shells from your eggs and half them. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients that you'd set aside together. Add a little bit of vinegar, sprinkle some salt and stir gently. Add the halved eggs into the bowl, mix and serve. Note: You don't need any salad dressings, such as mayonnaise for this bowl because you steamed your veggies in margarine and that’s enough. Enjoy!
