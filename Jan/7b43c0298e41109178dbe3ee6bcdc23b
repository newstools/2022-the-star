A man on a business trip to Mombasa has been left counting losses after his jaw-dropping Sh596,000 went missing after a night out with a woman. The man met the woman only identified as Wambui in Mombasa county on Saturday while partying at the newly launched VIP Club Volume in Shanzu. "After having several drinks alone, the man got attracted to one of Mombasa’s girls. "Without wasting time, the man who was deeply smitten by her looks beckoned her to join him, before another man laid his eyes on her," DCI said in a statement. The man tried his luck on the woman and the two struck a deal that would see them end up at an apartment where they were to spend a night together. They left the high-end establishment around 4 am and headed to Seville apartments, where the man had reserved a suite. It is there that the woman is said to have laced his drink with a stupefying substance and swept his bank accounts clean. "According to the victim, they took a shower before they went back to the room where he took a glass of juice that knocked him out a few minutes later. "He passed out until Sunday afternoon when the apartment’s steward knocked on his door. That’s when he discovered that he had become the latest ‘Mchele’ victim after he found his mobile phones, laptop, ATM cards and other valuables missing," DCI statement added. Detectives based at DCI Bamburi are currently hunting for the suspect.
