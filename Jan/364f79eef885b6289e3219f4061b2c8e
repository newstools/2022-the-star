Socialite Zari has asked her fans to pray for her as God is the only cure. "We may seem okay with wealth but wealth can't buy health," she said on Instagram. "Learn to thank God every day for the small things you have. I just wish I was poor with health, just pray for me, my wealth is nothing without God." Zari heads Brooklyn Colleges in South Africa, which she and her late husband Ivan Semwanga managed. After Semwanga's burial in 2017, it was reported that the family held a meeting and agreed that Zari should take care of the deceased’s property in South Africa. Zari is the highest beneficiary of Semwanga’s wealth, which includes two palatial mansions, real estate properties, Brooklyn Colleges and a 5-star hotel.
