At least six Meru herders have been confirmed dead at Mweronkoro within Matabithi in Buuri location, Tigania East in Meru. The herders were ambushed along the disputed grazing zones by camel herders from Isiolo who were on a retaliatory attack after angry residents drove their camels away from their farms early Wednesday. The residents had raised alarm to authorities forcing the herders to vacate their farms and grazing regions but calls to area chief and police allegedly thwarted peaceful coexistence. Residents said this is not the first time such attacks were happening in the area and their main agenda is to grab land belonging to them. "Locals were angered and protested against camels feeding on their farms. They protested and drove them away. In the evening, the bandits descended on them at the Manyatta's and shot them dead," a source who sought anonymity said. "A few days ago, area chief and OCS went on a mission to drive them away but they were called and told the camels belong to the mighty in government. They turned away. People are living in fear." Buuri Chief John Mamira told journalists at the scene that the bandits who were of Somali origin from Isiolo county ambushed at 6pm to dawn as they went on killing innocent people. "They invaded by 6pm and left six dead. Several people are missing. They have killed innocent people as we picked bodies of herders at milking sheds. There is no good reason for such a heinous act. Our people are always peaceful," Mamira said. He added that no one had so far been arrested in connection with the killings. He called for further investigation to bring the culprits to book.
