Right attacker Kelvin Omuse has decamped from General Service Unit to Kenya Defence Forces. Omuse, 23, has been with the paramilitary side for the last two years but joined Recruits Training School, Eldoret recently, according to coach Gideon Tarus. Victor Ouma, Naftali Chumba, and Nicholas Matui are the available replacement. Matui is back after undergoing training, giving Tarus options as the team hopes to defend their KVF title after returning to training on Tuesday. "Omuse is gone but his absence won't be felt because we already have tailor-made replacements. We are trying to get the players into shape as we gear for the league return in mid-month." Elsewhere, the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) are burning the midnight oil to replace the five players who quit the club for KCB and Kenya Pipeline. Right and left attacking positions are the key areas to be addressed according to coach Daniel Bor, with Veronicah Adhiambo's loss being the biggest blow to the club. "We are trying to see who can fit into Adhiambo's shoes. We resumed training on Wednesday but there's a need to find quick solutions in the aforementioned areas," he said. "The squad is thin considering the departures but we expect some developments in the coming days." In the meantime, Nairobi Water women's team will not be part of this season's league. The team is yet to return to training, according to captain Eliza Karugu. She said they are hanging in balance with no communication from the management. "To be honest, we are in limbo and we don't know what is going to happen. We haven't been told anything and It's likely that we are out of the league," says Karugu.
