Former Tetu MP Ndung’u Gethenji has been acquitted of charges of  creating a disturbance in the Kihingo village property dispute. In a ruling delivered on Thursday afternoon by chief magistrate Martha Mutuku, Gethenji was acquitted alongside six others who had been charged with him. Mutuku ruled they did not have a case to answer as the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against them. The court said  during the trial, it had been established the former lawmaker was not at the scene of the  incident. “From the evidence before the court, the case was brought to court against the  backdrop of animosity and massive grudges between Gethenji and the other party,” Mutuku said. She further ruled that charges were framed up against the accused. Mutuku said the accused were not arrested at the scene of the crime. She also acquitted Frankline Mutegi of an assault charge against lawyer George Wajakoya and his client Kisorkumar Dhanji Varsani. The court had been told that on July 2, 2019, the former lawmaker created a disturbance by interfering and stopping renovations of a house belonging to Varsani at Kihingo village in Kitisuru, Nairobi. Gethenji said his arrest was politically motivated. (Edited by V. Graham)
