MPs were not provided with bottled water in the chamber during the debate on the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Deputy Speaker Moses Cheboi said this was to avert instances where lawmakers use bottled water as weapons in case of fights erupting. “We know that some of us here have in the past used the water for other purposes other than for which it is provided.” “Members who want water can walk to the sergeants-at-arms and drink it there,” Cheboi, who is Kuresoi South MP, said. He spoke following a complaint by Isiolo Woman Rep Rehema Jaldesa that they had not been provided with water during the sittings. Last week, a debate on the Bill turned chaotic after MPs engaged in a fistfight with Singowet MP Benard Koin suffering an injury in the eye. MPs used bottled water to attack one another during the standoff. A week after the drama, another special sitting kicked off on Wednesday to debate and vote on the proposed amendments to the Bill. Allies of Deputy President William Ruto suffered defeats after they were outnumbered by the Handshake team. The first defeat was on an amendment that sought to expunge from Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021, a clause on the timelines of formation of coalitions before a general election. The amendments by Garissa Township MP Aden Duale were shot down after 128 MPs voted against while 104 lawmakers voted in support. Another amendment fronted by Nambale MP John Bunyasi, which was backed by DP allies and those affiliated to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, suffered a similar fate. MP Bunyasi had proposed amendments that would allow coalitions to only field presidential candidates but individual member parties allowed to field candidates for other positions. The bill was supported by Kikuyu MP  Kimani Ichung'wa The amendment was put to a vote where 111 supported the amendment while 132 (54 per cent) rejected the changes. The debate and voting on other amendments are on course. -Edited by B. Marita
