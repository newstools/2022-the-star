Four people escaped death narrowly on Tuesday after a trailer and a saloon car went up in flames along Ahero-Katito road, leaving occupants of the car with injuries. The car is said to have rammed into the trailer which was making a U-turn on the road in an accident that happened around 5am. Confirming the incident, Nyando OCPD Leonard Matete said that as a result, the two vehicles caught fire as the driver of the trailer escaped unhurt. Matete noted that the occupants of the car were rescued. "They were rescued and taken to Ahero sub-county hospital where they are admitted with a number of injuries," he said. According to area residents, the trailer driver was trying to make a U-turn in the middle of the road after realising that he was headed in the wrong direction before the saloon car from Kisumu rammed it. "The truck driver got lost and as it was trying to make a U-turn towards Kisumu, the saloon car that was overspeeding rammed it before the truck exploded into flames," Albert Onyango said. They appealed to relevant authorities to erect bumps along the road to avert such accidents in the future. In a police report seen by The Star, the driver of the saloon car had two passengers on board driving from Ahero junction heading towards Katito. The driver of the lorry whose registration number was not legible fled after the accident. The occupants of the saloon were rushed to Ahero Sub-County hospital where they were treated for chest and neck pains. By the time the firefighters from Kisumu County arrived at the scene, the two vehicles had completely burnt. The fire was later extinguished and the vehicles were towed to Ahero police station. Matete noted that they have launched investigations into the matter.
