A section of Kikuyu constituency MCAs say they skipped Deputy President William Ruto's Friday and Sunday visits in the area because they were busy serving their constituents. Led by Kinoo MCA Samuel Kimani, they said they were busy attending other important issues concerning their constituents. They will not be moved and have declared to wait for President Uhuru Kenyatta's political direction. “I was aware he was coming. My colleagues too were aware. We had not communicated to each other to declare that we will attend to the events where he was expected,” Kimani said. The MCAs who did not attend include Henry Kagiri (Kikuyu Town), Samuel Mugwanja (Karai), Naftali Ngugi (Sigona), Peter Kioi (Nachu) and Kimani. On Friday, the DP toured Uthiru, Kinoo, Muguga in Kikuyu constituency before proceeding to Ngecha and Kabuku in Limuru and later to Wangige. The DP was accompanied by MPs Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), James Githua (Kabete), Rugathe Gachagua (Mathira), including aspirants of different seats. Ruto visited the Rironi Catholic Church and later held different open air rallies at Kwambira in Limuru, while popularising his UDA party before visiting Thirime Primary School in Kikuyu where he attended a football mtch organised by MP Kimani Ichung’wa. The MCAs said they were not sold to the UDA narrative, and would wait for President Uhuru Kenyatta's political direction. “Our president needs a lot of respect. He has been working so hard to improve people’s lives, while other people are using his achievement to campaign for themselves,” Karai MCA Mugwanja said. (edited by Amol Awuor)
