The second leg of the Kenya Volleyball Federation League is likely to be played in May, according to KVF organising secretary, Ismael Chege. Initially, the women's matches were set for January 21-23 at Nyayo Stadium while the men's showpiece was to be staged at Mombasa's KPA hall this weekend. "The second leg will not go as planned. People are just back from the festivities and with the calendar very tight, we thought it best to push the matches towards the end of the season, just before playoffs. With the season-ending in June, May is a possibility for the postponed fixtures," Chege explained. "Teams are already planning for the third leg because the fixtures are out," he noted. Women's matches are slated for Mombasa February 5-6 with the men's matches planned for a week later in Nairobi. It remains to be seen whether matches will be played at Nazarene University hall after KVFentered an agreement with the institution to host some of their matches. At the same time, Chege categorically stated that the door is closed for teams to join the men's top tier while there's still room to accommodate teams in the women's cadre. KVF seem to have softened their stance with regards to female participation after Chege earlier warned that teams will be burred from this season's competition should they fail to turn up in the first two legs. The men's league has 16 teams with half the number featuring in the women's category. "The chapter is closed for the men. Teams that want to join will only be absorbed in the second tier. Four or five teams are enough to play in Division Two," Chege highlighted. "The window is still open for the women teams. We want the numbers to go up to enhance competition. It is only Vihiga County that has joined while we are yet to hear from Nairobi Water who were part of the league last season. The challenge is sponsorship. If clubs can have one on board, then they  would be good to go."
