The rise in cases of human-wildlife conflict in Naivasha has been attributed to the drought that has pushed wild animals from their natural habitats to farms in search of water and pasture. The conflict has left farmers counting huge losses. The wild animals have for the past two months been raiding farms on a daily basis. The most affected are villages those neighbouring Mt Longonot and Hells Gate parks. Residents of Kiambogo in Longonot, Naivasha, held a peaceful demonstration to protest against the attacks by the animals. Naivasha East MCA Stanley Karanja urged the Kenya Wildlife Service to compensate affected farmers. “The animals have injured a student and a motorcycle operator and the residents have been reduced to paupers who are now begging for food,” he said. Karanja said parks and ranches should be fenced to keep the animals away from farms and residential areas. Farmer Jane Wairimu said her son dropped out of school after a buffalo chased him while on the way to school. “In the process he fell and broke his hand. The situation has worsened as we do not have food as all our crops have been wiped out by the animals,” she said. David Mwangi said residents do not venture out of their houses early in the morning or late in the evening for fear of being attacked by buffaloes. “Farming is our only source of income in this area but all the crops have been destroyed by the animals and KWS has failed to compensate us,” he said. The animals, farmer Joseph Kuria said, stray into homes and farms as early as 6pm. “We have already recorded several incidents where residents have been attacked. Luckily, no death has been reported in this area,” he said. Edited by A.N
