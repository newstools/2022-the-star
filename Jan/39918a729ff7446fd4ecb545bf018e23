Sirisia MP John Waluke has told Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula to stop imposing a governor on the Bungoma people. Speaking at a funeral on Saturday, the MP said the mandate should squarely lie on the people of Bungoma who are supposed to choose who is best for them. "No one should direct residents whom to vote as governor. I want to ask my good friend Wetang'ula to allow residents to choose the leaders they want," he said. The MP challenged area residents to elect a governor with a clean track record claiming that the last two county chiefs have failed residents on development. Waluke said both Lusaka and Wangamati have been in power but residents are still lacking necessities like clean water for domestic use and electricity connection. "Counties receive a lot of funds from the national treasury. But due to the high levels of deceit in our county, they have squandered all the money set aside for developments in constituencies. That is why Sirisia has no development project," Waluke claimed. On national politics, the MP said the entry of the ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and his Ford Kenya counterpart Wetang'ula into DP William Ruto's camp has sent panic in some political camps in the country. "The team has now become more strong and ready to battle it out with Azimio la Umoja. Kenya Kwanza is after revamping the economy of the country through the bottom-up economic model," Waluke said.
