ODM boss Raila Odinga has convened high-level talks with at least 30 governors today in Naivasha to craft a deal and spell out their role in his presidential campaigns. Raila, who is taking a fifth stab at the presidency, is determined to pull all stops to stitch together an elaborate and well-coordinated campaign machine. The Naivasha meeting would be the inaugural political engagement between Raila and the county bosses as he seeks to hand them a bigger role in the grassroots management of his presidential campaigns.
