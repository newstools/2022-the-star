A primary school head teacher in Nandi county has been arrested after allegedly defiling a pupil in his office. Gibert Kipkosgei Menjo, 40, was placed in custody on Friday last week after the matter was reported to Chemundu police station in Chesumei subcounty by teachers at a boarding school. Subcounty police commander Bosita Omukolongolo said teachers raised the alarm after the pupil was found crying and complaining of pain when she left the head teacher's office. “Teachers and parents who responded to the distress hired a taxi and rushed the pupil to Kapsabet Level 5 Hospital where medics confirmed he defilement," he said. The OCPD added, “The head teacher whom the victim named was arrested and several exhibits were collected in the office. He will be arraigned." Police said they are also investigating a similar case of another pupil who said she was defiled by the same head teacher in his office two weeks ago.. The teacher faces two counts under the 2010 Sexual Offences Act of defilement and engaging in an indecent act with a child without her consent. Nandi county education director Zachary Muituiri also confirmed the latest attack, saying the Teachers Service Commission would take appropriate action. Muituiri said the TSC, which handles human resources,  had already visited the school, adding that “no stone will be left unturned in getting into the bottom of the matter." Teachers at the school claimed that the suspect had threatened them with dire consequences if they testify or aid police and TSC in an investigation. (Edited by V. Graham)
