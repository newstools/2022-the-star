National Police Service urges the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities, assures that security has been beefed up. The National Police Service has assured Kenyans that security in the country has been scaled up through different policing operations. The statement comes hours after France urged its citizens who are in Kenya to be vigilant while visiting public places as there is a real risk of targeting public places frequented by foreign nationals, particularly in Nairobi. In a statement released on Thursday, France said that restaurants, hotels, places of leisure, shopping centres are among the targeted places that should be avoided by its citizens. The Netherlands had also issued a similar warning of a possible terror attack in Nairobi and urged vigilance in areas frequented by Western nationals. However, in a statement Friday, NPS Spokesperson Bruno Shioso said the service has re-engineered its police units in line with modern-day policing dynamics, challenges and emerging threats. "The service has ensured security operations remains their priority, which will ensure that imminent attacks are forestalled," Shioso said.
