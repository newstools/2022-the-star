ODM leader Raila Odinga has for the first time weighed in on the alliance pitting UDA, ANC and Ford-Kenya parties. The opposition chief on Thursday exuded condifence in his presidential bid saying he is not bothered by the pact between Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. “Kama unataka kuenda kwenda kabisa, wazungu wanasema eti birds of the same features flock together. Kuna kitu mbayo inauganisha hawa watu Pamoja. Yeye anajua, iko kitu kwa kimombo ambayo inaitwa common denominator” Raila said. The ODM leader spoke at the party headquarters when he received a number of politicians who joined the party from ANC. He said that they have good plans with the right people who are willing to work with them and assured the Azimio la Umoja members that things will start working out soon. “Hivi karibuni, Kenya hii itaanza kuchemuka…hatuwezi kutatishwa na hawa watu, hii ni takataka.” Raila added that Kenyans are aware of the right leaders and that they will not vote for the thieves who have stolen from them. “Kenya is not on sale. Kenya will not be bought by money that has been stolen from the people of Kenya, we will liberate Kenya forever from these people. We did it from the shackles of dictatorship in the second regime that was torturing its people…” The former PM added that the same Kenyans who liberated the country from the second regime will liberate the country in the third liberation as well, which he said is about the economy. Also, he said that the Azimio movement is set to be officially registered next week. “Azimio la Umoja is going to be registered next week, if not tomorrow…and we will start moving straight to our people.”
