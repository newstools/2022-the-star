ODM party leader Raila Odinga on Saturday took the Azimio la Umoja gospel to Murang'a county where he held a mega rally at Ihura Stadium. Hundreds of residents streamed into the stadium with a host of popular local artists entertaining the milling crowd. Raila urged Kenyans to keep their hopes alive as, "good things are in the offing." "Kenya is coming together. Those opposed to a united country have gathered in one corner as the rest us continue spreading peace and love nationwide. Keep the hope alive," he said. On Saturday morning, hundreds of police officers were deployed to Ihura Stadium, following claims that some unnamed people were planning to disrupt the meeting.
