Tanzanian actress Wema Sepetu is dating. In a recent video, Wema said she will not post the face of her man on her social media as she does not want haters to keep reminding her of her past failed relationships. "I am the only person who knows my boyfriends. He is mine and no one is interfering with our love," she said. "The day you will come to see my man is after he has already paid the dowry. The process is there and I know God is going to fulfil that for me." In October last year, she admitted that her life is incomplete as she misses falling in love. Sepetu shared a stunning video of herself on Instagram dancing to Tiwa Savage's track titled 'Somebody's Son'.
