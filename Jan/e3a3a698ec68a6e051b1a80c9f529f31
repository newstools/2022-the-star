YouTube has announced the names of African creators who have been selected to join a global cohort of 135 from around the world in its flagship #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund initiative. The fund focuses on investing in Black creators from around the world who are telling fresh and authentic stories. While the group of creators from Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa come from varied professional, social and academic backgrounds, one common thread connects them all: the desire to make a difference in their communities and Africa through relatable and insightful content. They include Kenyan creator Justus Nandwa, who hosts the popular online series 'Shared Moments' with Justus, puts a human face to issues faced by ordinary African men and women by telling inspiring and life-changing stories. Fisayo Fosudo from Nigeria, who has a background in economics and communication, uses his channel, under his name, to analyse trends and developments in the technology space. South African self-published author, HIV-Aids awareness advocate and award-winning social entrepreneur Nozibele Qamngana has the mission to use her channel, under her name, to demystify and hold open conversations about living with HIV. As part of the #YouTubeBlack, Voices Fund Class of 2022, each of the 26 African YouTubers selected will receive seed funding alongside dedicated support to help them develop their channels. They will also take part in bespoke and hands-on training, workshops and networking programmes. Alex Okosi, MD, Emerging Markets, YouTube EMEA said they are excited to be working with an outstanding group of young and talented African creators. "This group of creators is making content that starts important conversations about issues we face in society, which really resonate with their audience." In 2021, the programme welcomed 133 grantees from Australia, Brazil, Kenya, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Brazil and The United States in its inaugural year.
