Kenya women's hockey team dismantled Zambia 3-0 to revive their hopes of sailing to the semifinals of the African Cup of Nations in Accra, Ghana. Goals from Aurelia Opondo, Flavia Mutiva and Grace Bwire at the Theodosia Hockey Stadium spearheaded Jacquiline Mwangi's side to a first victory in two matches. Ghana were awarded three points with as many goals without breaking a sweat on Tuesday as Kenya were not match-ready after arriving late for the biannual week-long showpiece. Opondo, who plays for Premier League side Lakers, gave Kenya the lead in the 10th minute, poking home from close range. Experienced defender Mutiva capitalised on Zambia's poor defending to double the lead in the stoppage time of the third quarter. Debutant striker Bwire completed the rout with a 56th minute deflected strike to mark a dream start to the competition. "The aim from the start was to play for a win. There was nothing more I could ask from my teammates," said captain Rodha Kuira. He added: "It was disappointing that Ghana were given a walkover against us but we still have to play Nigeria and the winning slogan remains. We want to qualify to the semifinals." Only Moureen Okumu, Mutiva, Leah Omwandho and Beatrice Mbugua were the senior players in the starting lineup. The quartet were part of Team Kenya for the 2019 Olympic qualifiers in South Africa. Kenya's new-look squad has a bright future with the team needing exposure for the juniors to fulfill their potential. United States International University USIU-A Spartans right back Lynn Mwangi justified her selection with a faultless display. The likes of Eleanor Chebet, Tamunai Kipsang also have another opportunity to impress.
