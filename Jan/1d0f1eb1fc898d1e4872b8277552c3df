The China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCCC) has said that it will hasten the construction of the Kwale -Kinango road. The project had delayed since last year because of hitches that had been caused by slow clearance of imported equipment at the Port of Mombasa. However, the hitches have been resolved and the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) said construction of the road will start in three weeks. KeNHA Coast Regional Director, Engineer Eric Wambua said the expansion of the road network in Kwale, and other Coastal counties would greatly boost economic activities and spur development. Wambua said the project will bring transformation in the county besides opening the hinterland and speeding up rural development. He said KeNHA is alive to the economic impact of tarmac roads in the region and added that other road projects completed in the area include the tarmacking of Lunga-Lunga-Vanga, Milalani-Shimba Hills and Kanana-Shimoni roads. Residents at the Coast region are expected to enjoy better connectivity once the Kwale Kinango road is complete. Residents said they are eager to enjoy the benefits of improved connectivity. The 29km road project is expected to be complete by 2024. Once complete, the road will boost growth of local markets in the area. Wambua added that the tarmacking of the roads will be a huge economic incentive to Kwale County and will in the long run greatly boost economic activities at the urban centers. “Massive investment by the national Government on the improvement of urban road network would significantly boost investment and the tourism sector in the region,” he said.
