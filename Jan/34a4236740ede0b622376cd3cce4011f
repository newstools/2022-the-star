Kenya has lifted its seven day suspension on all Dubai bound passenger flights effective midnight after a two-week standoff with the UAE over Covid-19 certificates. According to a report by the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, the suspension expired on Monday, January 24. The ban of all passenger flights to and from Dubai was issued on January 10. "Inbound and transit passenger flights from UAE are suspended for a period of seven days. We are doing this to reciprocate a ban on Kenyan passenger flights to UAE," Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said. The ban did not affect cargo flights which continued with normal operations. Last week, Kenya and Dubai failed to reach a consensus again over the ban. Kenya insisted that Dubai must first lift its ban on flights from Kenya, after which Nairobi will follow suit. Foreign Affairs CS Rachel Omamo told journalists the talks were between her ministry, the ministry of health and the officials from the Arab statelet. “We are still active on the matter, we want them to open their flight paths and then we will reciprocate,” she said on Friday in Nairobi. Omamo was briefing the media on milestones made by the ministry in the last two years. The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) banned all flights from Kenya on December 20 claiming several passengers arriving from Nairobi tested positive for Covid-19, yet they had certificates issued in Kenya showing they were negative. Last year, Dubai Civil Aviation Authority temporarily suspended all air transport services with inbound and transit passenger movements from Kenya. DCAA said customers will not be accepted for travel on Emirates flights in Nairobi during this time. Outbound passenger operations from Dubai to Nairobi remain unaffected. DCAA did not give a clear reason for the suspension of the flights, however, there have been concerns raised over travellers issuing fake Covid-19 certificates.
