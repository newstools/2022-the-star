Deputy President William Ruto has promised to ensure that residents of Lang'ata, Nairobi, have access to clean water if elected President. The DP who on Tuesday pitched a tent in Lang'ata constituency for his presidential campaigns said his administration will complete three key dams that will supply water to the area. He said his administration will endeavour to complete the ongoing Northern Water Collector tunnel to address water scarcity in  Lang'ata. "We have already Sh 1.2 billion into the project, as we finish it in the next few months, part of our priority will be to deal with the water problem here once and for all," the DP said. Ruto lashed out at Raila whom he has accused of doing little to improve the lives of the people of Lang'ata and Kibera despite serving as area MP for many years. At the same time, the DP revealed that the Northern Corridor, Ruiru and Karimenu dams, once complete, will be crucial in supplying water to Lang'ata. "This Lang'ata is known for lack of water, but the work we have done and especially the pipeline passing here from Kabete, through Kibera to Wilson Airport will deliver enough water for this area," he said. The DP also said his administration will complete the Karen business complex which is currently designed to be a two-storey building. "We shall make it a four-storey complex so that it can accommodate all our business people," he said. The DP has sustained his aggressive campaigns in Nairobi, targeting Raila's bases as he seeks to bolster his chances in the August 9, General Elections.
