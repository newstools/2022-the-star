Bunyore Starlets will have to solve their goalkeeping problems and work on players' mentality in order to arrest their poor away form, coach Daniel Arunga has said. Despite making Mumboha grounds a fortress, the newbies have lost all their away matches and have their work cut out with matches coming thick and fast. A 3-0 loss to Wadadia and 6-0 thrashing in the hands of ruthless Ulinzi last weekend is a course for concern despite the many challenges bedeviling the team. Arunga is forced to burn the midnight oil to fix the loopholes that are dragging his charges with priority given to maintaining their top flight status. "My first choice goalkeeper is juggling between work and training and hasn't attended training sessions forcing us to field her understudy. Nine goals in two matches is not the result we need to produce in this difficult league," Arunga remarked. "We have given away cheap goals like the 40 yards stunning strikes. We can be beaten two goals and then make a comeback. Psychologically, the players need to be in the right shape of mind when we play away from home." "The only way to secure safety is by registering better results away. We need to start doing that when we travel to face Kisumu All Starlets next week. There are some in house problems affecting us but that cannot be an excuse."
