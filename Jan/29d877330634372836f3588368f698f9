Kayole Starlets will be without Josephine Nana and Anne Angel when they face Vihiga Queens in the fifth-round fixtures of the Kenya Women's Premier League at Stima Club on Sunday. Nana, who has been outstanding on the right wing, suffered a knee injury in training this week while Angel who was withdrawn from the Kangemi Ladies match last weekend continues to be assessed by the physios. "Nana is definitely out but Angel will be assessed later today but her participation is in doubt because she hasn't trained," Kayole coach Joshua Sakwa observed. The offensive duo have been instrumental in Kayole's recent resurgence. The team edged out Zetech Sparks 1-0 at Ruaraka two weeks ago before making light work of Kangemi Ladies whom they demolished 6-0. Sakwa however believes his charges have what it takes to overcome Vihiga. "They (Vihiga) have looked vulnerable lately and have conceded goals. We can score and win as well why not?," Sakwa quipped. "We have had good training this week and the players are pysched up to take on the former champions. It is like any other match and they should not drop concentration. Our target is to collect 12 points in January." He added: "We won't make changes to the team and I hope the girls will manage the game well."
