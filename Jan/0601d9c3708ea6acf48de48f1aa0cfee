The news that Kenyans will from Friday get Covid-19 booster jabs is welcome. It is commendable that President Uhuru Kenyata and Chief Justice Martha Koome launched the drive at State House on Friday. The administration of the booster jabs was first made public on Saturday last week. The Ministry of Health guidelines will now see Kenyans who had been fully vaccinated receive an additional dose of either Moderna, AstraZeneca or Pfizer, six months after their second jabs. Though there was a lot of misinformation and reluctance initially, it is encouraging that so far, 9.7 million Kenyans have been vaccinated. The Health ministry has only fallen short of the 10 million target by a paltry 300,000. This is an excellent achievement. And the move to roll out the booster jab couldn’t have come at a better time than now given that the country is heading into a general election and huge political rallies will be the order of the day. The rallies might as well turn into super spreaders. The last minute rush by Kenyans to get the vaccines was also attributed to their faith in religious leaders who judiciously stepped out to back the vaccine campaign. Those sceptics yet to take the jab must consider doing so and those fully vaccinated should take advantage and get booster jabs to protect themselves against the Omicron variant spreading like bushfire all over the world.
