ODM leader Raila Odinga has called upon Kenyans to rally behind his candidature for the August 9, elections. Addressing hundreds of Thika residents at the Thika Stadium on Saturday, Raila said if he wins, his government will take care of single mothers in the country. “The special group, including single mothers who are also fathers and everything to their families, will be taken care of so that their children will not face challenges,” Raila said. He added that he has already engaged with small-scale traders and is aware of their challenges. Raila said he will ensure modern markets are built for business people and loans made available to mama mbogas by his government. On health, Raila said he will introduce the BabaCare program which will ensure that health care is available and accessible to all Kenyans. “Every Kenyan who will be sick will be treated and the government will cater for those who will not be able to pay.” The opposition leader also reiterated that the rural poor and the urban poor people will have something to smile about as his administration will set aside social protection funds to help them. “In every family that might not be lucky to work, they will get Sh6,000 per month.” Raila dismissed the remarks by Deputy President William Ruto criticizing his monthly pay to the poor by saying it’s a handout. “That is a necessity to sustain life, it is not a handout.” -Edited by B.
