Former Nyamira Governor John Nyagarama’s daughter has announced her bid for woman representative in August. Emily Nyagarama, 45, is a mother of six and holds a doctorate in Business Administration. She said on Monday she was inspired by the suffering of women in society, who do not get proper representation in the National Assembly. Emily spoke to journalists in Nyamira town when she declared her bid to run for the seat. “Our women, girls, youths and persons with disability have not been properly represented in the National Assembly and that is why I have decided to go for the seat to represent their interests in Parliament,” she said. Emily said she will focus more on protecting girls from all social evils. She said rape, defilement and gender-based violence will be her top priorities. “Poverty levels and social pressures have made mothers unable to take care of their girls, hence the upsurge in social evils like rape, defilement and other forms of gender-based violence. That is why I will be very aggressive in protecting girls and women,” she said. Emily said the county requires an aggressive person who can lobby for opportunities from the national government and from enterprises both locally and globally, saying she has the capacity to do so for the good of society. “At this point in time, our county requires someone who can lobby for opportunities especially for our youths who finish education and end up being drug addicts because of lack of jobs,” she said. On clan politics, Emily told off leaders dividing the society along clans. She said the community should rise above clan politics. “I'm shocked that in this era we are still clinging onto clannism. We are now cosmopolitan and we should rise above this clannism thing. We should focus on how to elevate our community from the poverty it is in instead of holding onto the clan politics,” she added.
