Saudi Arabia top tier side Al Ibtisam Volleyball Club have secured the services of Kenyan International middle blocker Simon Kipkorir 'Kosirai' for the 2021/2022 season. Kosirai is the captain of Kenyan champions GSU and boasts of three titles with the paramilitary side and the move is a big blow to the side who have highlighted their title ambitions once again. He made his debut for the national team in 2017 in the African Cup of Nations, Cairo, Egypt. The experienced centre player joins a growing list of Kenyan international players who have turned professional since last year. Michael Chemos plies trade with Tunisia's Mouloudia Sportive De Bou Salem that play in  Division Nationale A. Enock Mogeni dumped Kenya Ports Authority for  Smouha Club in Egypt  while Abiud Chirchir Kipkirui  turns up for Grand Nancy club in France. GSU coach Gideon Tarus previously said Chirchir is the best player in the French second tier.
