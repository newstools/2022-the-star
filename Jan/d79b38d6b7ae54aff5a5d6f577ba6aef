Ndaragwa MP Jeremiah Kioni has claimed his Bahati counterpart Kimani Ngunjiri attacked him during the debate on the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021 before the National Assembly. Addressing journalists at Parliament Buildings on Wednesday, Kioni said, “I could not believe that an old man like Kimani Ngunjiri can reach out and try to strangle me, the only reason being that I am voting on this side and he is voting on the other side." He said that the Bahati MP should have used a better manner to address the issue, rather than being violent. “When you lose that ability to talk to the other person and persuade him, you don’t belong to this House, and Kenyans need to know that the people you bring to the House are the people who can argue to your case.” The incident occurred during the morning session, where the MPs allied to the Deputy President William Ruto lost to their handshake colleagues. An amendment that was fronted by Nambale MP John Bunyasi, which was backed by DP allies and those affiliated to ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, was shot down before the House. Bunyasi’s amendment was seeking to have political parties in a coalition allowed to field their candidates for seats other than that of the president. He had proposed amendments that would allow coalitions to only field presidential candidates but individual member parties are allowed to field candidates for other positions. The bill was supported by Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa.
