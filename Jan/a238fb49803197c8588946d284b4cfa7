Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has been arrested from his house after a 20-hour siege. He was driven out of his compound by police after breaking into his house. He is on his way to Kamkunji police station for questioning. Wanjigi managed to stay put in his office for more than 20 hours fending off an attempt by police to arrest him. Wanjigi was holed up in his office bunker as a team of detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations sought to have him accompany them to their offices to record a statement. The detectives from Serious Crime Unit backed by colleagues from tactical unit of the Anti Terror Police Unit had arrived at Wanjigi’s offices on General Mathenge Road Monday at about 9.30pm ready to take him but did know it would take long. As they stood outside seeking to get into Kwacha House compound, Wanjigi, who was then in the company of his son and a group of campaign team, escaped to a bunker. It was after back and forth that the police were able to break into his house. But the ODM presidential aspirant said the incident was politically orchestrated due to his political stand and more so, remarks he made over the weekend. Earlier, police dispersed a group of youth outside his office. The youth are said to have been ferried to the compound on Tuesday morning by unknown people. Some had arrived aboard three buses and before they could alight, police lobbed a tear gas forcing the drivers to speed off. Police said some of those in the group were stealing from pedestrians and motorists.
