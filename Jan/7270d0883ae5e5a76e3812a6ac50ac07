Matumbo is a common meal among Kenyans. It is the edible stomach lining/ intestines of farm animals. Although some people regard it as a meal for people on the lower scale of the economy, with most high-end restaurants not including it in their menus, the meal is still a fine delicacy and the misconception untrue. Matumbo in English is known as tripe, a name known to very few. The meat is not only affordable but an excellent source of protein, a good source of zinc and phosphorous. It's best enjoyed with ugali or mukimo and a side of greens. Ingredients Method In a sufuria, add water till it covers the matumbo, throw the peeled garlic cloves into the water (this helps counter the strong smell of the meat) then place it over a heat source and bring to boil. Wash and dice, the onions and tomatoes into decided sizes. Allow the matumbo to boil till the water evaporates, turn off the heat and set aside. In a different sufuria, fry the onions till they're golden brown then add tomatoes, salt stir and cover to allow them to soften. Add all the spices, stir then add the cooked matumbo. Stir, cover and allow to simmer. Once it starts to stick to the sufuria, add some water continuously stirring over low heat. Add a cup of water and allow it to boil till dry, add chopped parsley, stir and turn off the heat. Serve with your preferred accompaniment. Enjoy.
