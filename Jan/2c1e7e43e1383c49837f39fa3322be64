ODM leader Raila Odinga cannot win the presidency without the backing of the One Kenya Alliance (OKA) leaders, Kitui Senator Enoch Wambua has said. “I cannot see how Raila can form the next government without the support of the One Kenya alliance leaders.  That is not possible,” said Senator Wambua. The Senator spoke on a Kamba radio station on Thursday. At the same time, Wambua stated that the ODM leader stands no chance of flying the OKA presidential ticket if he teams up with them. The OKA team, made up of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, Wiper's Kalonzo Musyoka, Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula and KANU's Gideon Moi, has maintained that Raila must support their preferred presidential candidate in the event he joins them. According to Senator Wambua, Mudavadi and Kalonzo have the highest chances of flying the OKA presidential ticket. “The available option is for Raila to join OKA but not as a presidential candidate. He must be ready to support a different person for the presidency,” said Wambua. The Kitui Senator, who was part of the OKA team that prepared a report that will guide the picking of the alliance's presidential candidate, revealed that Kalonzo stood a good chance of being favoured. He said they are looking forward to unveiling their presidential candidate before the end of January. “As OKA leaders, especially those from the Wiper party wing, we are going to ensure that before the end of this month, we have unveiled the OKA presidential ticket bearer,” said Wambua. -Edited by B.
