The cost of living in Kenya eased for the second straight month in January, driven by among others, a drop in electricity cost. Inflation rate was 5.39 per cent, Kenya National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday, down from 5.73 per cent in December, and 5.80 per cent in November. There was however an increase in prices of commodities under food and non-alcoholic beverages (8.89 per cent), transport (6.84 per cent) and housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels (5.11 per cent), between January 2021 and January 2022. The CPI increased by 0.31 per cent from an index of 118.274 in December 2021 to 118.642 in January 2022. The month-to-month Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages Index increased by 1.07 per cent between December 2021 and January 2022. This was mainly attributed to increase in prices of some food items, which outweighed the decrease in prices of others,” Kenya National Bureau of Statistics director general Macdonald Obudho said. The housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels’ index however decreased by 0.75 per cent between December 2021 and January 2022. This was mainly attributed to decrease in prices of electricity,” Obudho said. During the month, power bills dropped by 15 per cent with households consuming 50KwH spending Sh796.85 down from Sh852.26. Transport index also decreased by 0.11 per cent per cent as there was no change in prices of petrol and diesel. Households however paid more for Unga, a staple food in most homes with a kilo of lose maize flour going for Sh53.02 up from Sh51.65. A 2-kg packet of sifted maize flour sold for an average Sh126.31 up from Sh118.71, while a similar pack of wheat flour went for Sh144.45 up from Sh142.90, KNBS data shows. Sukuma Wiki, consumed widely in homes, went up with a kilo averaging Sh59.36 from Sh56.17 in December. A kilo of tomatoes  however went down to Sh102.72 from Sh103.40.
