Vihiga Queens mercurial striker, Jentrix Shikangwa, is edging closer to a lucrative deal with a Turkish top-tier club, head coach Boniface Nyamuyamu has revealed. Nyamunyamu confirmed that the Harambee Starlets striker had already begun processing her documents ahead of her anticipated trip in the coming days. “Jentrix is likely to leave. She has already started processing her travel documents ahead her trip to Turkey,” Nyamunyamu said. “Shikangwa will soon join a Turkish top tier side if all goes well,” the coach said. Talk of Shikangwa's departure emerged even as goalkeeper Lilian Awuor left for France on Tuesday night to link up with her new club. A source privy to the development revealed that Shikangwa would be visiting the Turkish Embassy in Nairobi to have her travel documents approved. Her anticipated departure could send the club back into the market in search of a suitable replacement. “Unfortunately, the window is yet to open for women's soccer but once it is open we shall need to get at least some new players on board,” said Nyamunyamyu. The club has also produced another top striker, Cynthia Shilwatso, who plies trade for Spanish top flight side Logrono. Meanwhile, Nyamunyamyu has dismissed as rumours information circulating on social media that the players are planning a go-slow over unpaid salaries. “We have been training and I'm yet to receive such complaints,” said Nyamunyamu.
