Comedian Mulamwah's baby mama Carrol Sonie wanted to give birth through CS. Speaking on her YouTube channel, Sonie said the doctor turned down her request. "I had opted for CS as I was scared of giving birth naturally but the doctor turned down the request, asking if I was crazy," she said. "My labour pains were not so serious." Sonie welcomed a daughter in September last year but she said Mulamwah badly wanted a baby boy. She said from her experience, she is afraid of getting another baby. "Having the nurses insert their fingers on you to check for dilation is so uncomfortable," she said. "I wish there was another way to measure how close the baby is. That made me say I would never give birth again."
