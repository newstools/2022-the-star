Newly appointed Nzoia Sugar coach Salim Babu admits he faces an arduous task in helping the team maintain their Kenya Premier League status. Speaking after signing a two-year contract with the millers on Friday, Babu urged his charges to step on the gas pedal as the competition gains momentum. “The task ahead is not easy. However, I’m confident that if we embrace teamwork, we shall manage. I can’t do it alone,” said Babu. “I missed the pressure in the Kenya Premier League. I’m happy to be back,” noted Babu who coached the defunct Western Stima and Sony Sugar. Babu who was unveiled on Friday added: “Our target is to avoid relegation this season. We are third-last on the log with just 10 points. It’s a tough job but achievable.” He takes over from Ibrahim Shikanda who was sacked on January 5 after a string of poor results. Babu dumped National Super League side Kisumu All-Stars for the millers.   His last game for All-Stars was a 2-1 loss to Vihiga United in Mumias last Wednesday. “I spoke with the management of Kisumu All-Stars and they agreed to release me amicably. I want to thank them for the support they gave me when I was there. I wish the team well in their quest to return to the KPL next season. We enjoyed a cordial working relationship.” Immediately after he signed for Nzoia, Kisumu All Stars' management appointed Evans Okech as the acting head coach. He will be assisted by Gad Kawuonda and Charles Bruno, according to a message on the club’s social media pages.
