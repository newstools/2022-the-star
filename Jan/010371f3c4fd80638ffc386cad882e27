Police in Kiambu are investigating an incident in which one of their colleague was found dead at the gate of Kimende police post on Friday. According to the police, the officer was on sick leave and was heading home. Lari subcounty police commander Stephen Kirui said the officer was stationed at Taveta police station in Taveta subcounty. He said since he was on a sick leave, and decided to go home to Baringo and rest . "The sick leave was signed last week on Wednesday at Taveta police station and so he left," Kirui said. "Since he was stationed at Kimende some two years ago, he decided to alight from the vehicle he was traveling in at Kimende to check on some officers who were his friends," he added. However, the officer neither arrived at the Kimende police post nor the Lari subcounty headquarters where he had been posted, Kirui said. "We suspect he was overpowered by his illness and collapsed at the roadside of the post's entrance and died." "We are investigating the incident to establish what really caused his death. His body was intact without physical injuries. His belongings which were in a bag were also found untouched," Kirui added. The incident attracted a huge crowd who suspected that it was a resident who was killed and his body brought to that place by the killers. (edited by Amol Awuor)
