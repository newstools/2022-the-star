Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala has told off ODM leader Raila Odinga over joining his Azimio la Umoja team. Speaking in Nakuru, Wednesday, Malala claimed that he received a call on Tuesday asking him to ditch ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi. The senator said the call promised that he would be paid if ditched ANC for Azimio la Umoja, but insisted that he would not betray Mudavadi. "The government has been calling ANC MPs asking them to leave the party by giving them money," Malala said. "I want to tell Kenyans that I was called yesterday and told to go take some money and leave Mudavadi and join Raila. I want to tell Raila Amollo Odinga to keep his money. I cannot betray Musalia Mudavadi." The Kakamega senator who is eyeing the county's gubernatorial seat in the August 9 elections told off president Uhuru Kenyatta saying that the Luhya community does not need handouts. He added that what the community wants is to have their dying industries revived. "I want to tell Uhuru Kenyatta, before you give us ugali at State House, revive Mumias Sugar company, before you give us meat from State House revive Nzoia Sugar, before giving us rice, revive Pan paper industry in Western region," Malala said. Malala had accompanied Deputy President William Ruto, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetangula to their joint mega rally in Nakuru. This was the first major rally the three have held together after agreeing to work together ahead of the August election. Speaking earlier in Eldama Ravine, Mudavadi said there was no way he would support a 'government project' because they are all stalled. "There are so many stalled projects, Azimio is another stalled project," he said. According to Mudavadi, the three came together to save the economy and take care of the needs of Kenyans. "We want youths and women to be empowered that's why we teamed up."
