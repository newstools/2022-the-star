Deputy President William Ruto has suffered another blow in coastal politics after one of his MPs decamped to rejoin Raila Odinga's ODM party. Kaloleni MP Paul Katana, one of Ruto's staunch followers, has ditched the DP’s UDA. Katana was among the ODM leaders in Kilifi who left the Orange party and shifted to Ruto. Months after the 2017 election, Katana alongside Owen Baya (Kilifi North), Aisha Jumwa (Malindi), and Michael Kingi (Magarini) ditched ODM and joined UDA. He has played host to the DP in several rallies and development projects in Kaloleni. In December last year, Katana accompanied Ruto in public rallies in Mariakani and Kaloleni in the constituency. Katana was also tasked with organising another rally in the neighbouring Rabai constituency. He was one of the trusted foot soldiers for the deputy president in the region. The first to ditch the DP’s party was Michael Kingi who joined the Pamoja African Alliance associated with his brother and Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi. Speaking in Kaloleni for the first time after re-joining ODM, Katana said he was not committed to UDA anymore. He announced that he would seek re-election on an ODM ticket “I know many things have been said over my short stint in UDA. I am an ODM life member and I am back home. As a leader you need to go where the interests of your people are well taken care of," he said. "The future of Kenya is in ODM and I am in full support of the Azimio la Umoja,” he added. Last week, Katana accompanied Raila for a rally in Mwatate, Taita Taveta county where he was officially received back to the party. Katana will face Edward Saro in the nominations. He is his biggest competitor so far. In Kilifi Baya and Jumwa are the only leaders who have remain loyal to UDA. Ruto also lost support of city lawyer George Kithi who ditched UDA for PAA. Another leader who has ditched UDA is nominated Senator Christine Zawadi. Zawadi declared that she is going for the Kilifi Woman Rep  seat on a PAA ticket.
