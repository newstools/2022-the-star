A journalist at Uganda's state broadcaster has been suspended for reportedly sharing a video of the prime minister almost falling off her chair, local media say. Ivan Kaahwa of UBC TV is accused of being the first to circulate the clip online, along with the caption "eby'okwokgera bimbuze" - meaning "I'm lost for words" in the Luganda language. The clip itself, which was not broadcast live on television, shows Prime Minister Robinah Nabbanja addressing the camera directly, before losing balance on her chair and chuckling. The clip she eventually shared to her own Twitter page addressed concerned about petrol prices caused by delivery delays Another Ugandan broadcaster, Andrew Kyamagero of NTV, has reported that Kaahwa was suspended on the direct order of the prime minister and the entire UBC crew that filmed the clip at her office has been threatened with criminal charges.
