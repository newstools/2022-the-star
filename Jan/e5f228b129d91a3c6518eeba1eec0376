Bura MP Ali Wario has criticised National Assembly Majority leader Amos Kimunya, for being used by the state to intimidate MPs allied to Deputy President William Ruto. Wario was reacting to a letter written to him by the National Assembly Majority whip Emmanuel Wangwe, on why he should not be discharged from the select committee on Regional Integration. The MP, however, said he will not be cowed into supporting any party apart from UDA. “Pursuant to standing orders 176 (1) and 176 (2) you are hereby notified that the Jubilee party which nominated you intends to discharge you from the select committee,” the brief letter dated January 7, reads. “You are hereby given seven days to respond before you are discharged from the said committee.” The letter was written and signed by Wangwe and copied to the speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi and clerk Michael Sialai. Wario said he was prepared to lose his position for supporting DP Ruto. “Kimunya can go ahead and give the position to whoever he likes in Kipipiri,” the MP said. “My support for DP Ruto is unwavering, I am ready to stay in UDA and go down with my candidate.” Wario spoke at his Madogo home in Tana River, on Thursday. The MP who has since declared his interest in the Tana River gubernatorial race said he was confident of getting the seat through UDA, a popular party that resonates well with the common Kenyan. “You can use all the tricks in the book to scuttle UDA and Ruto’s presidential aspirations but Kenyans will not be hoodwinked into voting for your preferred candidate,” he said. Wario said he would not respond to the letter as instructed. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
