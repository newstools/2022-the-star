Sony Group Corporation has started a new company that will be exploring the electric vehicles market. The electric car company will operate as Sony Mobility. The Japanese multinational conglomerate corporation president Kenichiro Yoshida presented a prototype sport utility vehicle called Vision-S 02 at the Consumer Electronics Show on Wednesday. This was the second version of the Vision S 01, which was tested on public roads in Europe from December 2020. Yoshida also unveiled a prototype sport utility vehicle (SUV). The vehicle has 7 seats and it is under 5 meters long. There is no information about its acceleration yet but Sony has said the original Vision S can reach over 60 miles per hour under 5 seconds. "With our imaging and sensing, cloud, 5G internet connection and entertainment technologies combined with our contents mastery, we believe Sony is well-positioned as a creative entertainment company to redefine mobility," Yoshida said. The car will have seat speakers which will wrap around passengers creating a ‘3-D sound field’, and allow game streaming via a play station console. Sony, one of the world’s biggest entertainment companies, owns Sony entertainment as well as a prominent video and movie production franchise. After the electric vehicle plans were announced, Sony shares jumped 4.2 per cent, outpacing a flat Nikkei index (N225).
