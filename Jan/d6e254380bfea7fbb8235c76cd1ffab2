Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo on Thursday spoke about the Goldenberg scandal which resulted in the 1992/93 economic recession. Jirongo claimed that two politicians and their accomplices of Asian origin were responsible for the scandal. "Wengi mmeskia kwamba YK 92 ilifanya taifa la Kenya uchumi ikaharibika na mimi nimebeba huo msalaba na nyinyi hamjajua ni nini ilifanyika," Jirongo said. Loosely translated as: (You've heard that yK92 was responsible for the country's economic collapse and I carried that cross for many years. You have no idea what really happened) "Uchumi wa nchi hii iliangushwa 1992 na wanasiasa wawili na Mhindi mmoja." In an indirect attack, Jirongo claimed that Mudavadi stayed in a house owned by Kamlesh Pattni who was implicated in the Goldenberg scandal but later acquitted. "Na wale hamniamini, mwende mfanye research. Ile nyumba ndugu yangu amekua akiishi Riverside ilikua ya Kamlesh Pattni ama haikua ya Kamlesh Pattni? Loose translation: (Those who do not believe should do research. Go and investigate whether the house that my friend has been living in at Riverside was not owned by Kamlesh Pattni?) On Mudavadi's deal with DP William Ruto, Jirongo said politicians should stop political greed and focus on Kenyans' needs. "You can't sit with a fellow corrupt leader and lecture Kenyans on corruption. That is embarrassing," Jirongo said.
