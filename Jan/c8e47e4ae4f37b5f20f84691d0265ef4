Tanzanian songstress Nandy is not pregnant. Speaking during an interview with Simulizi Na Sauti, Nandy denied the rumour, saying she would never hide a pregnancy. "I am not pregnant. I have been told I am pregnant for the last two years," she said. "Which pregnancy is this that does not grow, which I do not even give birth to? If I was pregnant I would not hide it." Nandy is engaged to Bill Nass, who proposed in April last year. There has been speculation that she is pregnant with his baby. The two went to the same school and dated secretly for a while but broke up in 2017. Nandy later dated media mogul Ruge Mutahaba, who died in 2019. Last year Nandy said she got pregnant with Bill Nass's baby but suffered a miscarriage. "I was excited about the pregnancy and of course I was hurt when I had a miscarriage," she said.
