A senior police officer was almost lynched on Wednesday evening after he demanded a bribe in Thika’s Runda estate. Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) boss George Kinoti, in a series of tweets on Thursday, said Police Inspector Davis Simiyu of Kikuyu police station, in the company of two others, walked to Heisenberg wines and spirits, masquerading as Kenya Revenue Authority officials. "After conducting a thorough ‘inspection’ of the liquor store, they turned to the owner David Mathenge and accused him of failing to issue ETR Tax invoices to customers," he said. Kinoti said they also accused the owner of selling products with fake excise stamps, after which they demanded a hefty bribe. "When Mathenge remained adamant that he was a diligent taxpayer operating his business legitimately, the three attempted to arrest him," Kinoti said. The DCI said the bar owner raised an alarm after suspecting the three were rogue officers. "This attracted the already agitated group of young men who came running, baying for the blood of the three," he said. Two suspects escaped in a getaway car, but Simiyu was cornered and beaten by the angry mob. "Police officers who were on patrol heard the commotion and rushed to the scene to save Simiyu," Kinoti said. The officers established that Simiyu was a rogue cop after an interrogation. "He is facing three court cases at the Nakuru and Milimani Law courts for the offences of impersonating KRA officials," he said. A fake KRA identification document was also recovered from him. The suspect is currently in custody facing personation and forgery charges.
