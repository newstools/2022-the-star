Doctors say two people have died and dozens of others were injured on Sunday in Sudan's capital Khartoum, in the latest round of demonstrations against October's military coup. One was hit on the head by a tear gas canister and died from a brain haemorrhage, while another died after being struck in the neck by a tear gas canister. A doctors' organisation allied to the protest movement, called the Central Doctors’ Committee, says 63 people have now been killed since the coup. Police in Sudan says 86 people were arrested during Sunday's unrest. The official Sudanese news agency described those arrested as "unruly protesters". The United Nations says it is trying to start talks in Sudan to resolve the political crisis and ensure there is a transition to democracy. At the start of January, Abdalla Hamdok resigned as civilian prime minister amid continuing friction between the military and pro-democracy campaigners.
