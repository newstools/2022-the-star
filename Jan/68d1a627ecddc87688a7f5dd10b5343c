KCB's maiden Kenyan Premier title hunt has suffered a huge setback after their talisman David Owino revealed on Monday he intends to leave during the ongoing mid-season transfer window. Owino, who has been at the heart of the bankers' watertight defence for two seasons now made his plans known through a message he shared on his social media account on Monday evening. “I am pleased that during this time ,I not only enjoyed every moment and good times but also acquired knowledge that elevated my personal life,” read the post. “I would also like to thank KCB Football Club for being accommodative and supportive during my tenure thus moulding me into a better player. “I want to thank my teammates ,manager and all staff members at KCB for this journey and to wish them a successful season ahead as I prepare for the next challenge,” wrote Owino. The mercurial Harambee Stars left back joined the bankers from Mathare United at the beginning of the 2019/2020 season where he contributed immensely to their splendid run which saw them wrap up the season second behind champions Tusker. Reports have linked him with a move to top-flight newbies Kenya Police who have plunged vast resources into the transfer market in an effort to afford their squad the desired depth.
