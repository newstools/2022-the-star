Tanasha Donna and Nigerian artiste Omah Lay have been rumoured to be dating. A few months ago, they were spotted chilling together in Mombasa. Over the weekend, the two shared footage from the same location on their social media, stirring the rumours. Even though the two have neither confirmed nor denied the rumours, Omah Lay said at a press conference last year he has a Kenyan girlfriend. "I have a Kenyan girlfriend. But I am single for everybody, the love from Kenya is amazing." He then changed his statement after being asked about dating Tanasha. "I am single, I said I had a Kenyan girlfriend but I am single. I don't wanna talk about the rumours on Instagram.. the videos and stuff," he said.
