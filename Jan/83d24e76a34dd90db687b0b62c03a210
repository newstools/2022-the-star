An ensemble of 74 players drawn from Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Rwanda, Zambia and Nigeria teed off on Sunday morning as the race for Kenya Open qualification takes shape. The action in the 2021/2022 Safari Tour golf series moved to the par 72 golf course at Limuru Golf Club. The event is the first of the three remaining series in the second leg of the road to the Kenya Open. The two remaining series will be played at Karen Country Club between February 5 and 9 and at the Muthaiga Golf Club from February 12-16, just a few weeks before the Kenya Open tees off on March 3. In addition to points towards the Magical Kenya Open Golf Championships, the top twenty professional players will battle it out for the prize purse of Sh2m. The winner has the potential of walking away with Sh300,000.
