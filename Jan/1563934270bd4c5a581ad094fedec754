National Super League log leaders Mombasa Elites are seeking to return to winning ways as they host Muhoroni Youth on Saturday at Serani grounds as the second-tier league resumes after a 3-week festive season break. Mombasa Elites lost 0-2 in their last encounter against Shabana at Sony Green Stadium in Awendo and coach Mohammed Mchulla is keen to see his side bounce back. “We started the season well, winning four games on the trot. The loss against Shabana was disappointing but we have learned from our mistakes,” said Mchulla. The youthful tactician added: “We did a lot of individual mistakes against Shabana. We want to improve against Muhoroni and record a positive result. Our target is to improve in a respectable position.” Mombasa Elites, who were previously known as Modern Coast Rangers, lead the NSL log with 12 points from five outings.
