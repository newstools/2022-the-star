This is an easy homemade snack at home with only one main ingredient, mango. It is a common street snack in Kenya, both in the urban and rural areas. Ingredients Preparation Step 1 Cut the mango in whatever manner you see fit, I prefer cubes. Step 2 Cut the lime and squeeze it all over the mango. Step 3 Dust the chilli powder over the mango. Step 4 Sprinkle salt (lightly) over the mango. Enjoy
