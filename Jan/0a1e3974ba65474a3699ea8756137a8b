A Tiktok video created by Justin Agustin, a fitness trainer that promises to help people go to sleep in two minutes has gone viral. The video which showcases a speedy sleep technique typically used in the military has been watched over 3 million times and has over 7 thousand comments. The video has helped Agustin gain 1.7 million followers on the app. He explained that 96% of people who actually get to master the technique can fall asleep within two minutes any time, anywhere they are regardless of noise or lack of sleep. According to Justin, start by taking several deep breaths as you consciously tune yourself to relax every part of your body. Start with the forehead then every other part of your head to the shoulders. Try and lose the tension in your shoulders then hands and arms. "Imagine this warm sensation running down from your head all the way down to your fingertips" Justin advises. Take a deep breath and exhale, continue relaxing your body from your chest, your stomach all the way to your toes. Calming ones mind is the next step in this viral technique. You're to image one of these scenarios, either: lying in a canoe on a calm day in calm waters or lying in a black velvet hammock in a pitch-black room. "If you're distracted, repeat the words don't think for 10 seconds," Justin advises. You're supposed to practice this technique every night for 6 weeks in order to perfectly master the art of falling asleep within two minutes. It's a fascinating approach as telling your brain not to think is guaranteed to make it actually think. And aren't you thinking about not thinking as you do this?
