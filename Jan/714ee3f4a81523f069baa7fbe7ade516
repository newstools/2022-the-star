There will be a traffic snarl up along Mombasa road Kenya National Highways Authority has said. In a notice on Wednesday, KeNHa said the snarl up is as a result of a stalled trailer. It called on motorists to be patient and observe lane discipline to a low smooth flow of traffic as they work to resolve the matter. "As interventions are made to clear the troubled section, we urge motorists to exercise patience and lane discipline for smooth flow of traffic," KeNHa said. Mombasa Road has in the recent past been experiencing recurring traffic snarl ups due to the construction of the Nairobi Expressway. Its construction has also seen other city roads face closure in the past, including the Waiyaki Way. The expressway is expected to be complete anytime soon as the Transport ministry prepares to start conducting test runs in March after which President Uhuru Kenyatta will commission it in April.
