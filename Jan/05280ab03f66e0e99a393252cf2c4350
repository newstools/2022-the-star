This is after he met Prof. Dr Sadrettin Pence who is the Vice-Rector of the University which is one of the key drivers of medical services in Turkey. “Prof Pence has offered to train 10 doctors on specialized oncology (cancer) training for FREE through his hospital University which is the largest in Turkey. "I will take this offer to the county government of Mombasa. Interested doctors should also contact our office for more information. There is so much that can be done with Turkey to assist us in Mombasa, ” posted Mr Shahbal on his Facebook page. The two met yesterday (Sunday) in Turkey where Shahbal had been invited by the city of Istanbul for meetings with potential investors. Mr Shahbal boasts of vast networks with investors across the world. He said Prof Pence who has set up affordable hospitals in Sudan, Somalia, and a few others in African countries and we discussed how we could duplicate the same in Mombasa. “This is part of my bigger plan of bringing investors to Mombasa. We can do it,” he added. The meeting with the Prof came after he visited the Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu traffic control centre to see the state-of-the-art traffic management system which he termed as an amazing world-class system. “God willing, we will implement this kind of system in 2023 when we take over the governorship of Mombasa. Mombasa must achieve World-class systems and standards, ” said Mr Shahbal.
