Coconut rice can be prepared by either soaking rice in coconut milk, cooking it with grated coconut flakes or adding coconut cream/oil to the rice. There's no clear history of its origin but the delicacy is said to have been birthed from a fusion of African and indigenous culinary mixtures. I usually blend the coconut rice with grated ginger for a tantalizing tangy taste. Ingredients Coconut rice Note: The coconut milk gives the rice a creamy rich taste while ginger blends in perfectly with a slightly sharp zingy taste. Beef Stew. Method Add oil into a cooking pan, allow it to heat then add onions stir and cover until they’re golden brown. Add tomatoes, stir then cover for a while until they’ve softened. Add the beef, salt to taste then stir and allow to cook over low heat. Add a cup of water and bring to boil over medium heat. Wait for the beef to semi-dry then add the chopped capsicum, parsley, crushed garlic and spices, stir gently and cover. Leave it for a few minutes then add half a cup of water and allow the meal to boil. Add the natural yogourt, stir allow it to thicken then turn off the heat. For the cabbage, steam them in a little water over low heat, then add margarine and stir. Let them sit for close to two minutes then switch off the heat and set them aside. Serve, garnish and enjoy.
