Vihiga Bullets assistant coach Milton Odera says his charges have little time to celebrate their first-ever victory in the Kenyan Premier League, insisting they should instead focus on improving their position. The bottom-placed debutants produced a top-notch performance to thrash fellow strugglers Wazito 4-2, and Odera particularly praised his team's fighting spirit. Bullets had led two nil before letting Wazito wipe out their lead but two unanswered goals later in the match ensured the memorable victory. "We thank God for our first win. Secondly, our boys fought like real soldiers. When we let Wazito back in the game they would have wilted because of our past experiences. The boys however went into second gear and we got the win I thought we very much deserved it," explained Odera. With Bullets still bottom of the table with 5 points — four below the safety spot — Odera urged the players to build on their maiden win. "Now, our aim is to continue working hard and try to win our match against Bandari this weekend," he said. A hat-trick from Mike Esabwa and another goal from Vincent Ogolla handed Juma Abdalla's charges their maiden top-flight win.
