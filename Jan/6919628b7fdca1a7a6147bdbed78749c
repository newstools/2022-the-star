The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) has rolled out the second and last phase of the enhanced voter registration ahead of the August 9 elections. The exercise, which began on Monday 17, will run till February 6 and comes after the commission failed to meet its target of registering 6 million voters. In a statement on Monday, chairman Wafula Chebukati said the second phase offers an opportunity for registration with the commission targeting to net 4.5 million new voters. "IEBC will conduct the exercise in 12 countries among them Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, United Kingdom, Canada, USA, South Sudan, Qatar, UAE, and Germany," Chebukati said. IEBC is going flat out to mobilise Kenyans to register as voters. The poll agency has structured the mobilisation to target youths and people with disability. To have more youths register, the commission says there would be a biometric voter registration kit at every university to enable students to register.
