Mwenda Mbijiwe's brother has begun walking from Meru to Nairobi to seek answers for his mystery disappearance. Mbijiwe, a security analyst, went missing more than six months ago. Nicholus Bundi says he will trek to the DCI offices to compel director George Kinoti to reveal where he has reached with the investigations into the disappearance of his brother. Bundi carries Mbijiwe's photos and placards asking the government to reveal his brother’s whereabouts. “Since my brother's disappearance we have been living in distress. We want our brother alive or dead. If he is dead we will bury him and be at peace with ourselves,” he said. Bundi spoke to journalists in Chuka town on Tuesday as he was on his way to Embu. He said police have been reluctant to reveal the whereabouts of his brother. Bundi said at one time when he was making a follow-up he was told to go to morgues across the country and see if he will find his brothers body. “I was shocked that the police were telling me to do the job they were supposed to do. “When he went missing he had a gun and a phone. However, only the car he was using was found but he has not been traced and neither has his firearm,” he said. Mbijiwe went missing in June last year, when he was driving to his Meru home on June 12. He had called his two mothers — one living in Timau and another in Kibirichi. He told his mother in Kibirichi to prepare him mokimo. The plan was to spend the night in Kibirichia and then visit his birth mother, Jane Gatwiri, in Timau. No one has seen or heard from since that day. His hired Toyota Fielder was found abandoned and vandalised at a coffee farm in Kiambu. Mwenda was a popular TV analyst on security and counter terrorism. He also unsuccessfully vied for Meru governor in 2017. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
