The Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021 is full of mischief. The proponents of the Bill targeted the One Kenya Alliance by limiting the time one would have to join a coalition. They wanted Oka to have only one month to organise themselves and join another group. They believed Oka would have quickly joined Azimio. They had fears the alliance would have moved towards Deputy President William Ruto. That is why they had to convene a Special Sitting. But this came with costs, among them mileage and sitting allowances. Taxpayers paid for this. During sitting, Covid-19 protocols were also not observed. The House was full with no social distancing. This was a super-spreader event. The Bill has given the Registrar of Political Parties a lot of powers. This person can stop you from contesting in an election. He or she can also take action against you for being disloyal to your party. Where do you draw the line between being disloyal and giving your opinion? The Bill is also trying to sanitise ODM leader Raila Odinga. After conning a lot of players on the political scene, people behind the Bill want to give the impression that the problem was the law. They want to tell people that the law will force Raila to give partners money from the Political Parties Fund or the law will force him to honour MoUs. It is also important to note that there is no one election that Raila contested and accepted the outcome. They now want to tell us that by amending the law, elections will be free and fair and therefore Raila will not reject the results. There were reports that a lot of money changed hands in Parliament to secure the Bill's passage. This tells you there were a lot of hidden agendas. Why were they forcing things? The Special Sitting was very expensive to Kenyans yet there was no urgency. If they had convened this meeting for MPs to discuss, say, the food crisis or floods, it would have been okay.
