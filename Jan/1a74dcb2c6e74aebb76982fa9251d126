Athletics Kenya Nyanza North has waived the registration fee for athletes participating in the regional cross country championships scheduled for Sunday at Kiendege Secondary School. Regional chairman Peter Angwenyi said the decision is informed by the need to have as many athletes as possible take part in the event. “We want all athletes from the region to participate in our championships. Most of the athletes are upcoming and thus unable to raise registration fees,” Angwenyi added. Angwenyi, who spoke to the Star on phone, further added that they expect to use the event to select 42 athletes for the national championships. The nationals will be held at Kapseret in Uasin Gishu County on January 22 while the Agnes Tirop Memorial World Cross Country Tour on February 12. “Now that we have waived registration fees, we expect a huge field and for scoring purposes, we urge athletes to register from their respective counties,” added Angwenyi. He said due to the punishing January weather, the event will start at 9am. “We don’t want the event to go past noon because of the harsh January weather conditions,” said Angwenyi, adding that the course has already been marked. Meanwhile, one of the top athletes expected for the senior women’s event has pulled out. Winfridah Moseti, an experienced road racer said she is yet to heal from a nagging hip injury. “I would have loved to participate in the event but I’m yet to recover. I hope to start training in the next two weeks once my physiotherapist gives me a go-ahead,” said Moseti. In Moseti’s absence, Faith Bett, Italy-based Teresia Omosa, Christine Oigo and Tecla Nyabuto are expected to dominate. In the senior men’s category, the favourites are training mates Sammy Nyokaye and Dickson Simba. They will, however, face upcoming stars in Felix Boera, Aburi Morang’a as well as veterans Richard Atuya and Duncan Manyara.
