Harambee Starlets and Vihiga Queens mercurial forward, Jentrix Shikangwa, is a couple of days away from completing her dream move to Fatih Karagümrük S.K. in the Turkish top-flight league. Shikangwa's planned trip came to light on Friday afternoon after the Legacy Makers took to their social media platform to share the good news. According to the message, Shikangwa will board a flight to Turkey early Sunday and is expected to arrive in the country at around midday. The club is based in the Karagümrük neighbourhood of the Fatih district in İstanbul. “The Executive Committee of Vihiga Queens Football Club are proud to announce that our lethal striker Jentrix Milimu Shikangwa is set to travel to Turkey to join Fatih Karagümrük S.K. in the Turkish top division,” wrote the club. “Jentrix will leave the country on Sunday, January 23 in the morning and land in Instabul, Turkey before mid-day. The club said the development testified to the ballooning interest foreign teams continue to show in their players after their splendid run at the Caf Women's Champions League Cecafa qualifiers in Nairobi where they emerged champions to qualify for the competition proper in Egypt. “We hope that more of these interests will develop into opportunities for our girls to go forth and conquer the football world,” continued the message. “As Vihiga Queens, we shall forever be grateful to Jentrix for her services to our club especially during the Caf WCL Cecafa zone qualifiers where she emerged as the tournament's Most Valuable Player and scored our winning goal in the finals from the penalty spot.” The development comes barely a day after Shikangwa's teammate, Lilian Awuor, left for France to link up with French top tier side ASJ Soyaux-Charente. The hawk-eyed custodian landed the plum deal with the French club following her stellar performance at the Confederation of African Football Club Champions League in Egypt.
