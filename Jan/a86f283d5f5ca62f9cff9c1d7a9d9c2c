Kenya national women's team coach Jacquiline Mwangi says her charges must show more desire and ruthlessness if they are to progress beyond the semifinals of the African Cup of Nations in Ghana. Kenya defied all odds after coming from behind to beat favourites Nigeria 2-1 in a must-win game. Kenya suffered an early setback when Benedicta Johnson gave the west Africans an 11th-minute lead. Red-hot Aurelia Opondo equalised four minutes later to see the tie end 1-1 in the first quarter. Opondo was on the score sheet in Kenya's 3-0 rout of Zambia on Wednesday. Naomi Kemunto was the hero as Kenya scored six minutes from time to send the crowd into a crescendo at the Theodosia Okoh Hockey Stadium, with the East Africans taking either Namibia or Zimbabwe in the last four. "We are happy for what we have achieved so far. The aim was to progress and the girls have made us proud. This is proof to the world the talent that Kenya has," Mwangi said. "We cannot rest on our laurels. We have to show hunger and focus in our next assignment but all in all, we are in the right direction." Skipper Rodha Kuira, added: "We played well and the players deserve credit. It was a tough match because of the quality of the opponent but three points mattered most." Nigeria captain Alfa John said it was heartbreaking to lose to Kenya. "We lost at the most crucial moment and we couldn't convert our chances to cap our dominance," she said. Kenya rose above adversity that marred the team. The late approval of the budget meant that the women's team a walkover in their match against hosts Ghana on Tuesday after arriving late for the tournament. However, the men's team overcame jet lag to demolish Namibia 4-1  the same day. They then lost 2-1 to South Africa on Wednesday but were already in the semis. Captain Constant Wakhura's 40th-minute goal was a consolation after Ntuli Nqobile's double gave South Africa maximum points. The week-long event ends on Sunday.
