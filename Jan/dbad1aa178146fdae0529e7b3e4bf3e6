Residents of Ichuni in Masaba South in Kisii want the government to deploy officers to a newly constructed police station in the area to stem acts of lawlessness. They spoke of a surge in criminal activities, including attempted rapes and muggings  in the face of the delay by the government to post security officers to the station. The station’s construction was funded by the MP Ezekiel Machogu, who is also Kisii governorship aspirant. “He (Machogu) dutifully obeyed our calls to have this  station set up but since it was finished the government has not shown any willingines to give us officers,"Dickson Nyakenyanya, group leader, said. "We request the Interior Cabinet Secretary Matiang'i to give this plea the urgency it deserves,”  he added. The residents are forced to travel to Ramasha police station  which is 18 km away to file complaints, a distance they consider far. “ Machogu was gracious enough to respond in kind by funding this  station’s construction and it is good that the government reciprocates by posting the officers here,” Nyakenyanya said. Rose Kerubo, a resident and parent, said her daughter was almost defiled at dawn as she left for school last month. She also said there had been a spate of house break-ins and muggings in the area which should be tackled as soon as possible before the situation grows out of hand. “There  is a national college, Keroka Technical Training College which hosts many of its students, some of who stay around. They need security too,” she said. “Insecurity is a social vice that should not be politicised as we suffer,” she told journalists during a press conference. She said officers from Keroka Central police station fail to respond to their distress calls citing boundary and area of jurisdiction. (edited by Amol Awuor)
