A rejuvenated Kariobangi Sharks side rallied from a goal down to demolish AFC Leopards 3-1 in a Kenyan Premier League encounter played at Moi Stadium, Kasarani Stadium on Saturday. Leopards snatched an early lead through midfielder Eugene Mukangula in the 15th minute only for Julius Masaba to ruin the party with a well-deserved equaliser six minutes later. Sharks returned from the breather more purposeful and focused to wreck havoc on the 13-time champions but had to wait until the later stages of the second half before their determination finally paid off. Their desired moment finally came when Felix Oluoch found the back of the net in the 67th minute to take his season's tally to eight goals and enhance his chances at a maiden Golden Boot accolade. Eric Mata then hammered the final nail into the felines' casket with a clinical finish in the 85th minute, effectively halting Leopards' six match unbeaten run. The outcome has fired Sharks to the third spot with 24 points while Leopards remain in an unimpressive 14th in the log with 14 points.
