Deputy President William Ruto's Jacaranda rally was faced with hooliganism after rowdy youths pelted stones at the meeting. The incident, however, did not interrupt the DP's meeting as the rally went on as planned. In his address, the DP accused Raila of having a penchant for hiring youths to cause violence at his meetings. Ruto said the ODM leader is known for planning violence adding that it is time he should stop misusing the youths. "Shame on you bwana kitendawili for hiring youths to come and stone people here. You won't intimidate us with violence," Ruto said. He added: " You planned violence in Kondele, you have come here again in Embakasi to mobilise youths to stone us. We will not allow you to instill fear in the people of Kenya by using violence". Ruto further said if elected president, he will ensure the youths are sorted with jobs and their small business empowered so that they can earn a decent living. "I want to tell you Raila, these youths you are misusing to stone people will only be available for six months from now. After that, they will be sorted with better things to do that will change their lives for the better." The DP appealed to the youths across the country to maintain peace during the electioneering period. He urged them not to accept being used by politicians to cause violence. "Don't accept to be used by anyone who gives you money so that you fight your fellow Kenyans. Don't accept to be used to throw stones. Tell that person to use his family members to go and throw stones." The DP's Jacaranda rally was a culmination of a series of meetings he held in Nairobi last week.
