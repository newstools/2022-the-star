After breezing to victory in the men's 10km senior race at the Nairobi region cross country championship, Geoffrey  Rono says he is not overwhelmed by the prospect of matching up against seasoned runners at next weekend's national cross country championship in Eldoret. The 21-year-old timed 27:49.1 at Kenya Prisons Service grounds in Nairobi West to cross the finish line first, ahead of Musa Mitei and Meshack Letim who clocked 27:56.6 and 28:11.8 to finish second and third respectively. Rono says his main objective in Kapseret will be to do the Nairobi region proud by getting on to the podium. "It may be an easy race today but the main focus will be in Eldoret where the real battle lies. I am looking forward to running a good race at the national championship and hope to get into a good position," Rono said. He will be joined in Eldoret by, among others,  Florence Chepkoech who coasted to victory in the women under-20 6km race. Chepkoech clocked 19:33.9 as Triza Cherotich (19:49.2) and Yvonne Chepchirchir (20:02.9) came second and third respectively. The youngster was over the moon after her first win in cross country, describing it as the product of the many hours she has put in training. "I have been working a lot on my speedwork and endurance. It is my desire to perform well at the national championship. I know I can get a better result than my 13th place finish last year," she said. In the women's 10km senior race, Emily Chebet ran 32:13.2 to beat the tape as Winfred Yavi timed 32:23.7 in second, ahead of third-placed Mercy Chepkorir who clocked 33:03.8. Chebet said the race was the perfect preparation for her stab at road races this year. "My focus is now on road races. During the Istanbul Marathon recently, I finished seventh but I believe I can do much more. Today's competition was to fine-tune my speed and I am glad that I won," Chebet, who finished second at the same championship, said. Results 10km senior men 1. Geoffrey Rono - 27:49.1 2.
