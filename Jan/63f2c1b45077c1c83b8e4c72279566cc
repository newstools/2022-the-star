ODM leader Raila Odinga has earned the support of many Ford Kenya leaders who ditched the party and joined outfits supporting his presidential bid. Kitutu Chache MP Richard Onyonka who was elected on the Ford Kenya ticket is the only MP who joined the ODM party. A majority of them decamped to the newly launched DAP-K party that is supporting a Raila presidency. Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati is among the leaders who have ditched Ford Kenya following his fallout with party leader Moses Wetang'ula.
