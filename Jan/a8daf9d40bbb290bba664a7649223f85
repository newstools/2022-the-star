Singer Wahu has paid tribute to her late dad, nine years on. The mother of two shared his photo, wondering how his relationship with her kids and husband would be if he was still alive. "I can almost see my Tumiso talking to you about boys she likes & sharing her big dreams and desires with you (boys and dreams were topics you welcomed! Now that I'm a parent, I understand why)," she wrote. "I wonder how your relationship with Monski (Nameless) would have evolved... And if he would have finally learnt how to describe building designs in Kikuyu." She recounted their tight relationship and thanked him for being an amazing dad to his children. "You were not rich in silver, gold or earthly belongings, but in love, kindness, honesty and dignity."
