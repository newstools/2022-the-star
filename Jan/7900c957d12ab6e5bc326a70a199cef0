Residents of Bomet have been urged to work together with security teams in the area to bring down the rate of crime. Bishop Alfred Rotich of Kericho Catholic Diocese said when there is good working relationship between the public, police and other agencies, peace and harmony can be fostered hence such cases are completely averted. “When we all collaborate by highlighting the happenings in the society we can be sure of having these cases that are bedeviling us and ensure we all coexist together,” he said. Rotich made the remarks during a joint thanksgiving service for the uniformed services at St Michael Catholic Church in Bomet on Saturday. The service brought together Kenya Police, Administration Police, Kenya Prisons Service, Bomet administration Police Football Club, the Kenya Forest Service and members of the public. Also present was County Commissioner Susan Waweru who hailed the officers for the noble course. She said this will go a long way in alleviating suffering that the needy children in the society may be undergoing. During the event, the officers donated mattresses and food items to Ndanai children’s home in what Bomet county police commander Naomi Ichami said was in line with this year's theme of helping the underprivileged in the community. Ichami said the main aim of holding the event, which is the third since its launch in 2020, was in line with their outreach programme of ensuring there is teamwork among the various security agencies of having crime totally brought down in the county. “We are building the spirit of togetherness and at the same time sensitising our people to be confident and volunteer any information that may be helpful to us in ensuring peace in the county,” she said.
