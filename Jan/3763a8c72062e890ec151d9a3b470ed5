DP William Ruto has asked ODM party leader Raila Odinga to also apologise for balkanising Kisumu and other ODM zones. This was after he apologised obout Meru senator Mithika Linturi's 'madoadoa' remarks. Speaking in Kericho on Monday, Ruto said Raila should stop sponsoring violence whenever leaders go for campaigns in ODM zones. "Kisumu belongs to everyone in this country we should not be stoned and the gentleman is just quiet," Ruto said. In November last year, Ruto’s motorcade was stoned in Kondele, Kisumu county after what police said was caused by a disagreement in the distribution of campaign funds. "Kisumu should not be a no go zone for leaders,"Ruto added as he fired up the crowd in Kericho. Ruto said the ODM leader should style up and address the issues of violence ahead of August elections. "Let him talk to us about Kibra and Kondele and the violence that he organises. We want to get rid of political intolerance in this country," he said. "let him declare that when we defeat him in the polls he will not organise violence but pack and go home." Hours after Ruto’s motorcade was stoned in Kisumu during his campaigns, the police said that they had received intelligence of tension in the area and informed the DP before he made the stopover. Ruto was forced to cut short his speech while addressing residents in Kondele as his convoy ran into a hostile reception of rowdy youths on his second visit to the lakeside city.
