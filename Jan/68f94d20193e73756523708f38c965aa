Zambian Super League giants Zesco United are set to unveil Kenyan forward Vincent Oburu on Monday. Oburu, 24, arrived in Ndola from Nairobi a fortnight ago for trials and was handed a contract after impressing coach Numba Mumanga. The striker rose to prominence following a successful stint with traditional Kenyan giants where he netted goals with unmatched ease, effectively cementing his role in the starting lineup. Oburu later decamped to Wazito in August last year. He earned a call-up to the national team Harambee Stars in 2017 and played a crucial role in their successful Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup campaign where they clinched the title. The player's transfer had initially run into a hitch after Wazito made lofty demands. The sides, however, reached a common ground following frantic deliberations. Oburu is expected to earn his debut appearance in a league encounter against Kafue Celtic this weekend.
