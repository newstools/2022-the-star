Entrepreneur Cody Sooden has taken the world by storm with his new invention. The CEO and co-founder of Kara Water designed a portable device that turns air into pure drinking water and acts as a humidifier as well. According to his LinkedIn account, Cody revealed that he’d been working on the project for the last 10 years. He said he is overwhelmed by the support both in sales and crowdfunding that his project has received so far. The device; Kara Pure was unveiled in December and has received immense accreditation and support from people globally it's the first air to water dispenser of mineral rich water in the world. According to Kara water's website, at only 19 years, Cody wrote a research paper on vapour harvesting while in the university and the paper did not only completely change his career path but his life goals. But that wasn't his only motivation. Cody grew up in a town that had its drinking water contaminated by a bacteria strain that made it unsuitable for consumption as it lead to health complications. This pushed him to try to find solutions to water security. According to their page, Kara Pure works by extracting water from the atmospheric moisture, then turning the absorbed moisture into mineral-rich alkaline drinking water that also helps cleanse toxins within the body. The device, which resembles a silver dispenser though slimmer and less defined, not only dispense 10 litres of water a day but also operates noise-free. It has just a single button near the top  that triggers it to dispense water into the cavity that’s large enough for a glass or bottle to fit, at the middle of the device The fact that Kara Pure doesn't rely on groundwater at all ensures that it can work effectively anywhere on the globe as long as it is connected to a power source. Cody wrote that he and his team were now more than ever convinced that air to water technology would play a major role in the future of water security.
