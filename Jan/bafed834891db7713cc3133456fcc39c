Kiambu Governor James Nyoro has condemned Meru Senator for his utterances on Saturday, during Deputy President William Ruto's rally. In a statement, Nyoro said Linturi's remarks set a very dangerous tone in a region that has experienced the ugly side of political intolerance. "We still have residents from Kiambu who have lived in Rift Valley, and who are yet to fully heal the scars of political intolerance," he said. "We condemn these reckless utterances in the strongest terms possible." The governor thanked the Director of Public Prosecution, Noordin Haji for asking the IG Hillary Mutyambai to investigate the matter and take action against Linturi. Nyoro urged security agencies to hasten the investigations to stop any other person intending to incite against other people. "We ask the security apparatus to expedite this process, as a deterrent to any person regardless of their social or political status, who incites members of the public against any person or community, with the sole aim of causing anxiety or breach of peace and tranquility." The DPP in a statement on Saturday said Linturi's utterances could incite contempt, hatred, hostility, violence or discrimination. "Pursuant to Article 157 (4) of the Constitution, I hereby direct that you immediately institute comprehensive investigations into the said allegation and submit the resultant investigations file on or before 14th January, 2022," Haji said. In a video that has gone viral, Linturi is heard saying, "We want to be in the coming government but I want to tell you people of Uasin Gishu not to play with Kenya and I am asking you to remove the spots you have here. We cannot stand with William Ruto from Mt Kenya yet you have people here who don't listen and cannot team up with him."
