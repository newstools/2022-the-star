National sevens team, Shujaa, suffered one of their heaviest defeats in history as a rampant Australian side thrashed them 42-0 in the opening match of the Seville Sevens. Innocent Simiyu' s charges were no match for the well-oiled Aussie outfit who toyed with them in a one-sided display of might. The Australians, who were losing semi-finalists last weekend in Malaga, got off to a flying start when Henry Hutchinson sliced open the Kenyan defence to score a centre post try. Dietrich Roache kicked over the conversion for a 7-0 lead and then, two minutes later, Hutchinson combined brilliantly with Roach to dive at the corner with Roach putting in the extras for a 14-0 lead. The Australians denied Kenya possession and on the stroke of halftime playmaker Maurice Longbottom scored a third with Roach adding the conversion for a 21-0 lead. On resumption, a relentless Aussie outfit showed no mercy as Corey Toole pounced on a loose ball to score with Roaches converting for a 28-0 . Shujaa were relying on scraps of possession and the few times they had the ball they took the wrong decisions resulting in a turnover. From one such turnover, Toole capitalised to score his brace with Yool Yool closing out the rout to leave Kenya needing to beat Canada and Scotland on Saturday if they are to qualify for the Main Cup quarterfinals. Shujaa had a disastrous outing last weekend in Malaga finishing 14th overall and winning one match out of five
