Telkom users have expressed their disappointment with the mobile service provider over service interruptions. On Wednesday, users could not access services such as phone calls across other networks, internet surfing services and couldn’t even transfer money to other mobile network users. The company took to Twitter to apologise for the inconvenience caused by an interruption on their GSM prepaid services, and global data. “Dear Customer, we are currently experiencing a service interruption on our GSM Prepaid Services, and Global data. We are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience,” Telkom tweeted. Expecting the services to be back sooner, the consumers were later shocked to find out that the issue would take time to get resolved after the company replied to their earlier tweet saying it had taken longer to resolve. Telkom service users took to social media to talk about the inconveniences caused by the network interruption, as well as business losses. “Last week your network was down. This week, today, it’s down. Starting to think the network was operating better when you were Orange, perhaps return back to privatization?” Bob Matharu said. Mobile network operators have aided citizens especially in Kenya to access calls from different parts of the country, internet services and money transfers. Telkom Kenya is one of the first telecommunications companies in Kenya and is government owned.
