DPP Noordin Haji has issued directions for investigations to be undertaken on persons publishing incitement content on the “Lamu County Politics Unlimited Group" Facebook account. In a letter dated January 14 and sent to IG, Haji said there are 12 pseudo names that are being used in the group to cause incitement. The 12 are; Dylan, Cyte Nymz Maina, Muthoni Martha, Lucy Peter, Anthony Mambo, Njeri E. Mwaniki, Frank Mwangi, Josh Mhumble, Alphaken Madiba, Paul Keta Sikujua, David Brighton and Ndirangu Kenn. "The aforementioned person has published content that may incite feelings of contempt, hatred, hostility, violence or discrimination towards a certain ethnic group which is contrary to the constitution," he said. "I hereby direct you to institute comprehensive investigations into the said publications." Haji asked the IG to submit the resultant investigations file within 30 days hereof. "A progress report should be forwarded to my office within 14 days for further directions," he said. On Tuesday, Haji stepped up the fight against warmongers to ensure peace and stability across the country before, during and after polls. Haji warned he will not spare anyone caught committing a crime in the name of politics. He said the law will apply fairly to everyone. “The law is clear and we will apply it well to those breaking the law,” he said as he warned all concerned parties not to engage in hate mongering. The DPP told off those seeking to challenge his drive saying the law is clear. “Break the law at your peril,” he said. The latest victim under probe is Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot. Haji ordered that he (Cheruiyot) be investigated for allegedly uttering inciteful remarks. Even though conviction rate on hate mongers has been low officials said they will continue to apply the law. Most of the hate speech related cases drag in courts before they are thrown out.
