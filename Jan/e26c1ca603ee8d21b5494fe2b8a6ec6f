Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has said his arrest has nothing to do with his parcel of land in Westlands where one of his houses sits on. Wanjigi was arrested on Tuesday afternoon after police camped at his office off General Mathenge road in Parklands for 20 hours. Speaking at Kamukunji Police Station where he was taken after the arrest on Tuesday, Wanjigi questioned the timing of his arrest. He said the government has a penchant for arresting him during an electioneering period. “There is a bigger picture here and it has to do with the election, after all, why is it every election it's Jimi Wanjigi that is being sought by police? In 2017, they raided my home, now in 2022, they have also come for me. In between that, there is no offence, it is about elections. I’m making the elections very uncomfortable for some people,” Wanjigi said. He also told journalists that he is not financing anybody in this year’s election, but his presidential campaigns. Wanjigi managed to stay put in his office for more than 20 hours in an attempt to avoid arrest. He was holed up in his office bunker as a team of detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations sought to have him accompany them to their offices to record a statement. Earlier in the day, two courts issued contradicting orders over the arrest of Wanjigi. One of the courts issued an order for his arrest while another stopped the arrest pending the hearing of a petition that had been filed. High Court Judge Anthony Mrima issued conservatory orders stopping Wanjigi's arrest in a petition filed under a certificate of urgency.
