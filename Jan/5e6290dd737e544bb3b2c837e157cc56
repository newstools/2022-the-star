Garlic is literally a spice goddess. It literally can be added to most meals and on top of that makes broths and detox water as well. It has a strong scent that gives meals a tantalizing aroma and a distinct yummy taste. Garlic bread is an Italian-American invention attributed to the first wave of emigration to the US. There are several methods and twists when it comes to preparing garlic bread, the easiest one being cutting a clove of garlic and rubbing it over toasted slices of Italian or French bread, and then proceeding to coat the toast with olive oil or butter For a crunchy and toasty bread, one should bake it open-faced in the oven then go ahead and broil it at the end for extra crispiness Ingredients: Method: Preheat the oven to 400°. Peel and cut off the tips of each knob of garlic preferably without detaching the cloves from it. Place each knob on an individual piece of foil then pour olive oil on top of them Wrap the foils then bake them for about 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow them to cool enough to handle. Once cooled, proceed to squeeze the garlic into a bowl with the butter, chopped parsley, salt, and lemon zest. Using a hand mixer, whip the butter until light and fluffy. Take your bread and cut slits about 1-inch apart into it ensuring you don't cut all the way through the loaf. Using either a spatula or butter knife, spread butter inside each slit generously or add your grated cheese. Line your aluminium foil then place the bread on it. Then using a pastry brush, spread some more butter (you can also sprinkle grated cheese) over the top of the bread. Wrap it in the foil and place the wrapped foil on a baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes, then open the foil exposing the bread (it should be golden and toasty at the edges) and bake for an additional 5- 10 minutes depending on the desired level of crispy. Remove from the oven, allow to cool a little then cut into desired sizes. Serve and enjoy either on their own or with accompaniments.
