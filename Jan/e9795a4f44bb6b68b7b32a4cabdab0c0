Gourmet coffee may seem like a very complicated word, but it is not really. Gourmet simply means a fine food or drink that has been approved by a recognized authority to be excellent. The only difference with this speciality of coffee is that it is made from 100% Arabica beans instead of Robusta, which is the highest grade of coffee available. Robusta beans are cheaper because they are cheap, easier to produce and they grow faster than arabica. While Arabica beans require a cool subtropical climate with high altitudes in order to get that smooth, powerful and aromatic brew. This caffeine drink is believed to have originated from the Oromo people in Ethiopia, however, there is no definitive evidence that coffee was grown before the 15th century or even when it was first cultivated. From ice creams to cakes, this drink is more than a beverage. In order to celebrate this magical creation, which is celebrated every 18th of January, do enjoy a cup of high-grade coffee.
