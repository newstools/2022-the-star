The national government has disbursed Sh30 million for completion of the Kisumu West subcounty headquarters that was abandoned 13 years ago. The project in Ojola is set to be completed within the next 16 weeks. Subcounty deputy commissioner Charles Wanyonyi said his office will ensure quality construction. He was speaking during the handing over to the contractor. The headquarters will house all government offices of the subcounty. Wanyoni said it will be the envy of other counties in the region. "And I will ensue we get value for money. “I promise to ensure they abide by the legal provisions, the Public Procurement and Assets Disposal Act and Public Financial Management Act to deliver the project y within the set timeline," he said. Wanyoni said he had joined the local leadership headed by Kisumu Woman Representative Rosa Buyu to push for the release of funds to complete the building. Buyu thanked Interior CS Fred Matiang’i for factoring the funds into this year's budget. She said for the past 13 years, the building has been unfinished while records in government books indicate that it was completed and in use. Buyu said Matiang’i was keen to have the building completed as it's government policy that no new projects should be started before stalled projects are completed. “We had to fast-track this, visiting  offices to ensure funds are allocated to finish up the works,” she said. Buyu said it was ridiculous to give new headquarters to other subcounties when the Kisumu West subcounty headquarters has been incomplete since 2009. Nyanza regional works officer Benjamin Ahura announced the contractor reported the building had already consumed Sh35 million by the time it was abandoned. Ahura said the contractor had developed Bills of Quantities and the cots of vandalism had been factored in. “The new contractor will tile the entire building, painting, fixing windows, doors and ceiling board amongst other things," he said.
