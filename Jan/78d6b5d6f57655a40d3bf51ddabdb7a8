Kiambu politicians interested in vying for the senatorial seat have started making their intentions clear ahead of the August polls. The latest to declare interest is Kiambu county Head of Delivery Unit  John Mugwe. Mugwe said he has knowledge of how the county works and will represent the county’s interest with passion at the Senate. “So far, I feel I have what the county needs from a senator. I can also play an oversight role well” he said yesterday (Tuesday) in Limuru town. “I have been an executive in a county, an advisor for the governor and head of a unit," he added. "I know the challenges leaders go through, where they fail, how to speak to residents and even lobbying for funds, as well as projects that benefit the community.” Mugwe, together with Governor James Nyoro, and other aspirants, partnered and formed United For Kiambu in order to lock out first-time governor, William Kabogo. However, when Waititu formed the second government, Mugwe was sworn in as Roads executive. He was later sacked. One of his supporters, John Mwangi, says that owing to Mugwe’s productivity, Nyoro accommodated him in his government and offered him a job. “Nyoro could not have offered him a job if he knew he cannot deliver. Therefore, I feel we will not have gone wrong to elect him as the next senator,” he said. He will be battling for the position with former MCAs Mutonya Njenga (Sigona), Karungo Thang’wa (Ngewa), former assembly speaker Gathii Irungu and State House director for political affairs, Machel Waikenda.
