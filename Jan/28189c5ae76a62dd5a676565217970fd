Deputy President William Ruto has told off ODM party leader Raila Odinga over giving handouts to the youth. Speaking in Eldama Ravine on Wednesday, Ruto, who was in the company of ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula, said Raila should respect the youth the same way they respect him because of his age. He insisted that Kenyan youths want jobs, not the former Prime Minister's handouts. "Ule jamaa wa Kitendawili anataka kuja na handouts na kwa sababu ya umri tunakuheshimu lakini hata wewe heshimu vijana... Hawa vijana wakenya wanataka kupangwa na ajira si handouts," Ruto said. This loosely translates to, "The Kitendawili guy (Raila) wants to come with handouts but because of his age, we respect him and he should respect the youth. Young people want jobs not handouts." Ruto's remarks were in response to Raila's promise to give a Sh6,000 monthly stipend to jobless youths and poor families if he is elected president in the August 9 polls. Mudavadi said there was no way he would support a 'government project' because they are all stalled. "There are so many stalled projects, Azimio is another stalled project," he said. According to Mudavadi, the three came together to save the economy and take care of the needs of Kenyans. "We want youths and women to be empowered that's why we teamed up." On his part, Wetang'ula said teaming up with Ruto was a step in bringing Kenyans together.
