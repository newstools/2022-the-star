Former child star Ian Nene says his rebellious teen years were the catalyst to his decision to join Hinduism. He played the role of Almasi in the local TV show Machachari. "I did not really have a manual, I free balled everything. I was a wild kid," he said. "My parents could not tell me anything and I did what the hell I wanted to do. As time went on, I realised I did not know what the hell I was doing with my life. I had made such rash decisions. Decisions that seemed unchangeable, that I could not do much about tarnished my relationships, my circumstances, my reputation. "I felt like I was tarnishing my life. Up until a few years ago I came into contact with the Bhaktivedanta and got to understand that actually I can change all that around. "And situate me in the right mentality and have the right principles and manual to live my life." Almasi who is now a spiritual leader said Bhaktivedanta made him a better person.
