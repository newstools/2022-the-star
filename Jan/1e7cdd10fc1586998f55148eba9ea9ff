Pascal Tokodi and his wife Grace Ekirapa are expecting their first child. The couple announced the news on Instagram. "A place in my heart I never knew was empty has been filled," wrote Tokodi. Ekirapa added, "The Lord continues to perfect all that concerns our lives, and it is beautiful in our eyes. This is a story we shall tell one day. Happy new year from our growing family." The couple tied the knot in 2020. Celebrating her birthday last year, Tokodi said Ekirapa will make a good mother "and I can't wait to make you one". The couple met at a Java hotel. "I remember staring at you as you looked for a place to sit," Tokodi recounted, adding that they smiled at each other.
