Cotu boss Francis Atwoli has hit back at ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi for questioning his leadership. In a statement via Twitter on Sunday, Atwoli criticised Mudavadi for agreeing to work with Deputy President William Ruto saying he has 'ashamed' the Luhya community. "... who told him he's going to be President? Befriending Ruto is not the key to Presidency. He has ashamed the Luhyas by allowing Ruto to fund his NDC," Atwoli wrote. "As I said earlier, ANC and FORD-K are political commercial kiosks   for  Mudavadi and Wetangula." Atwoli said he will respond fully to Mudavadi's surprise deal with Ruto on Monday. "Mudavadi, in 1994 while minister for finance, sneaked in the redundancy clause into the Finance Bill of 1994, as suggested by the World Bank, which allowed employers to declare redundancy without consulting workers. So how will he empower workers?," Atwoli added. During his Presidential bid launch at Bomas of Kenya, Mudavadi took a swipe at Atwoli over his corrupt leadership of the labor sector. Mudavadi said the labor sector is in turmoil and 'inviting ICU'. His sentiments left the crowd roaring as they chanted, "Atwoli must go". "Clueless and clowning self serving leadership Under the labor sector," mudavadi said. Mudavadi went ahead to question Atwoli's wealth. "It's dominated by a few people who properly boast and display their trappings of massive opulence," he said. Mudavadi also took a swipe at Atwoli and his 'friends'. "And their stories if you're not keen are about clownish cowboy clubs," be added.
