The media should take the blame for the ban on politics at pulpits, ACK Archbishop Jackson Ole Sapit has said. According to Sapit, the media relegated religious messages to the back burner. Sapit said what he did was not in bad faith but was meant to protect the church's integrity, which was being overtaken by politics. “The message that was conveyed by the media was purely politics and sidelined the word of God,” the Archbishop said. The bishop spoke at St Paul’s Memorial ACK Church of Maseno North Diocese on Sunday. “Media only focuses on what the politicians said while in church which abused the house of the Lord,” the archbishop said. “So my decision was when in church for worship the message must be focused on worship alone not politics,” he said. Sapit said he values and respects politicians but they can only talk politics after the church service. “I can’t ignore you because this congregation is the one that elects you and you serve them so I must give you room to address them but that should be after the service,” he said. Sapit also urged political leaders to preach peace as they seek different elective seats ahead of the August polls. The archbishop said this when he attended a breakfast meeting at the home of nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi's home in Emusenjeli. “Politics will come and go but Kenya will remain so we must advocate for peace," he said. The archbishop urged the electorate to make wise decisions by electing leaders who can improve their lives.
