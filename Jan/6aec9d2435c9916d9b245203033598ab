Capital FM's Alex Nderi alias DJ Lithium breathed his last on Wednesday evening at Nairobi hospital. Sources told Word Is that DJ Lithium collapsed at Capital FM offices and left behind a note. It is at this point that his workmates tried to resuscitate him but to no avail. Before his death, Lithium deleted all his social media accounts and texted close friends and family telling them he is gone. He passed away while receiving treatment at Nairobi hospital. Police have launched investigations into the incident. Kilimani head of police Muturi Mbogo said Lithium was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. "He was confirmed dead on arrival," he said. The incident happened at Lonroh House in the Central Business District but the hospital reported it to the police minutes later. According to one of his colleagues, the DJ cited family issues as part of the reasons he died by suicide. “He had family issues that he cited as the motive for the incident. We are shocked,” said one member of the staff. His colleagues said he was a versatile DJ who could play everything from R&B to Hip Hop but his strength lay in EDM and Afro-house.
