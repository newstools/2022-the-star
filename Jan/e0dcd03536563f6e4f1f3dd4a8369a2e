Showmax has announced the next original series in Kenya, 'Single-ish', a 13-part drama series that will premiere on the platform on January 20. Adapted from the hit South African series 'Unmarried', 'Single-ish' follows the lives of three women in Nairobi: Sintamei, Mariah and Rebecca. They deal with the challenges that marriage, relationships and their careers throw at them. The series explores the strong bond of friendship that these women share, knowing that even when the world crumbles around them, they will always have each other. Gathoni Mutua plays the role of Sintamei, the overachieving, career-focused woman and a brilliant lawyer who seems to have the life that any woman would dream of. She has been happily married for 10 years to the man of her dreams. Minne Kariuki plays the sassy Mariah, a woman with a taste for the finer things in life, who uses her looks to get whatever she wants. Faith Kibathi plays Rebecca, the humble and down-to-earth woman, a housewife and a mother of two who has lived with her high school sweetheart for nine years despite not being officially married. Speaking about the series, Philippe Bresson, the producer, said in a statement that it depicts real life in an unfiltered way. “To me, this is real filmmaking. When you are able to tell the story as it should be, so even as the viewer watches it, they will be surprised, shocked and will fall in love with how we tell the story," he said. "I don't think there's been any other show that has pushed the boundary in terms of women’s issues as we have.” 'Single-ish' becomes the second Showmax original series in Kenya after the Kalasha-nominated hit police procedural and legal drama 'Crime and Justice', and the streamer’s third original title in the country following the recent launch of the film 'Baba Twins'.
