Six people have been killed by suspected al Shabaab militants at Witho shopping centre in Lamu East. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia said bodies of the six killed in the 11pm attack on Sunday were taken to the Mpeketoni hospital morgue. According to a police report, four people were set ablaze inside the Murimi Mangwe drinking den and got burnt beyond recognition. Police have since identified the four as the den owner John Murimi and his three casual workers Peter Musyoka, Maina Wanjege and Peter Maina. The deceased had their hands tied from behind. Villagers said a group of about 30 militants invaded the area killing people and setting buildings ablaze. The fifth victim of the attack Joseph Mwangi who is also Witho village elder was beheaded at his home and his house torched. He also had multiple stab wounds on his stomach. The sixth casualty has been identified as Francis Kamau who had mysteriously disappeared on Sunday morning before his body was found along the road within Witho shopping centre. The body had gunshot wounds to the head. Residents are now counting loses after property of unknown value was destroyed by the militants who torched several houses. A joint security team comprising the KDF, police and anti-terror unit has since visited the scene and recovered one spent cartridge. The motive of the attack is yet to be established. Macharia said adequate security units have been deployed to pursue the suspected attackers who are believed to have fled into the Boni forest. “We suspect they are al Shabaab militants but we are still investigating to ascertain their true identities,” he said.    -Edited by SKanyara
