ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Monday be in Naivasha where he is set to preside over a consultative meeting with governors who are supporting his Azimio la Umoja drive. During the meeting, Raila is expected to craft a deal with the county bosses and spell out their role in his presidential campaigns. The Naivasha meeting is the inaugural political engagement between Raila and the county bosses as he seeks to hand them a bigger role in the grassroots management of his presidential campaigns. Deputy President William Ruto who was expected to continue with his extensive tour of Nairobi county has retreated to re-strategise. The second in command was expected to tour Dagoretti, Lang’ata and Kibra sub counties to drum up support for his 2022 presidential bid On Sunday, Ruto attended a church service at the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (P.C.E.A) Neema Parish-Pipeline, in Embakasi South. He went on to address Pipeline and Kware residents before he closed with a mega rally at Jacaranda grounds, which was marred by chaos, caused by rowdy youths. The situation was, however, contained by the police.
