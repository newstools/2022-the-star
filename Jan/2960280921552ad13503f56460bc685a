National champions Ulinzi Warriors will take on Lakeside as the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) playoff quarters start on Saturday. The soldiers’ tactician William Balozi says he is still aware that it was the Kisumu side who inflicted the first regular-season loss to his charges and must face the duel differently. “We have trained well. We are ready for Kisumu,” Balozi said about the matches to be played in the beat of three series. Thunder, led by Morans’ captain Griffin Ligare, will play Strathmore University Blades, a team they beat twice in regular season. But the students' coach Tony Ochieng says insists history will count for nothing at the play-offs “My team is ready and everyone understands the weight of this game. I will have to stop their runs from the backcourt,” he said. Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Will travel to Eldoret where they will meet Eldonets Platinum in an eagerly-awaited encounter. The hosts are still up in arms about their away fixture against the porters in Mombasa where KPA were awarded a walkover. In the ladies’ matches, top seeds KPA face Strathmore University Swords, a team they easily thrashed in the two regular-season legs. The other fixture pits Maurice Obilo’s free-shooting Zetech University Sparks against Africa bronze medallists Eagle Wings. On Sunday, Equity Bank will confront the University of Nairobi “Terrorists” who are back in the playoff for the first time since 2007. Reigning women’s champions Equity have a date with Africa Nazarene University (ANU), whom they crushed 2-0 in regular season.
