Having wallowed in a "dark cloud" at the start of the year, Madison Keys booked her first Grand Slam semi-finals in four years on Tuesday with a 6-3 6-2 upset of Barbora Krejcikova at the Australian Open. Keys' renaissance after a dismal 2021 season has lit up Melbourne Park this year, and at a baking hot Rod Laver Arena, fourth seed Krejcikova became another casualty of the American's new-found confidence and traditional firepower. Banging down back-to-back aces to claim the first set, Keys roared to a 3-0 lead in the second before a rare wobble on serving gifted French Open champion Krejcikova a break. Unbowed, Keys unleashed a blistering forehand return winner down the line to break back and sealed the match with a thumping first serve that Krejcikova could only push long. Keys will play the winner of Australian world number one Ash Barty and American Jessica Pegula for a place in the final.
