Recently I was driving in the Athi basin on some of the newly reconstructed roads. I was with two international visitors who were really enjoying the outing in the park. Naturally they did mention earlier that they were happy with whatever they saw, but that seeing a lion would be very special for them. Not far from the hippo pools we rounded a corner and saw a few vehicle parked on a side track parallel to a newly constructed raised culvert over the road. As I slowly moved over the raised culvert, the people in the vehicles began to point at the storm water pipe inside the raised culvert, and mouthed the word “lion”. Soon I managed to position my vehicle exactly in line with the pipeline and had a clear vision of a sleeping lion within the storm water pipeline. It was clear that this lioness was really enjoying the cool shade and tunnelled windy breeze inside the pipe. It was about 33 degrees Celsius in the Athi basin, and that made me wonder how much cooler it might be inside the stormwater pipe. It was possibly quite a bit cooler inside that pipe. It is interesting how some wild animals take advantage and virtual ownership of some manmade structures in conservation area’s, and the Nairobi National Park creatures are definitely no exception. Other species that also often use stormwater pipe as temporary “homes” include jackals,  warthogs, mongoose and spotted hyena’s. The Nairobi National Park lions have become world-renowned, and they also display themselves very grandly for thrilled visitors when they pose on top of the stone junction signs. We hope and pray that future generations of visitors from all over the world will continue to be able to enjoy the sighting of seeing “lions on signs “ and the occasional “lion in a pipe” as well.
