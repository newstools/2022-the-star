Kakamega Homeboyz head coach Bernard Mwalala says immense pressure to stay at the top spot of the Kenyan Premier League log cost them their unbeaten run. Homeboyz suffered their first loss of the season after crashing 1-0 to debutantes Talanta at Bukhungu Stadium on Tuesday. Former Homeboyz striker Edwin Lavatsa returned to hound his team with a 16th-minute strike that condemned the home side to the second spot, where they currently sit with 25 points level with leaders KCB who enjoy a healthier goal difference. Speaking shortly after their match on Tuesday,  Mwalala revealed that his team has been in superb condition since the inception of the league, a fact that subjected them to a lot of pressure. "We lost the match and no blame games but this will re-energize the team now to fully focus on the title. "The thought of the unbeaten record resulted in complacency, leading to the loss but I believe this will now make the team stronger and more focused on the title,” said Mwalala. "We are taking each match at a time and we need to treat every team with the respect they deserve. At this level all teams are ready and fighting for maximum points," noted Mwalala. He added that he noticed some mistakes during the match against Talanta and hope to correct them before the next encounter. Homeboyz's assistant captain Ali Bhai asked the fans to remain patient and continue supporting the team as they look forward to a strong finish.
