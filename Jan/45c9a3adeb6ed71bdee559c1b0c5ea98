Starehe MP Charles Njagua, popularly known as Jaguar has officially joined Deputy President William Ruto's camp. News of his move to the Ruto-led party was announced on Twitter, Monday, by the United Democratic Alliance. "Welcome to the Hustler Nation Hon Charles Njagua AKA Jaguar, MP Starehe Constituency," UDA said in a tweet. The singer turned politician was welcomed to UDA by DP Ruto. Also on hand to welcome the Starehe MP were MPs Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu) and Oscar Sudi (Kapseret). Jaguar had previously enjoyed close ties with the Deputy President and went around the country campaigning for his 2022 presidential bid before he ditched the DP's camp. He has not been seen around Ruto or MPs allied to him in months. Speaking after the announcement, Jaguar said that the DP's bottom-up economics is what best suits the people of Starehe Constituency. "A time has come and decisions have to be made, the welfare of the people has to be considered. Starehe is a cosmopolitan constituency with many Small Medium Enterprises(SMEs) and the bottom-up ideology suits them best," he said. "Due to this, I feel that working with the Deputy President in his party as he runs for his presidential bid and as he works towards implementing his policies is the best option for my people of Starehe." The MP thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for the good working relationship they have had since 2017. Jaguar's move comes a few days after comedian Jasper Muthomi, alias Mc Jessy, announced he will be vying for the Imenti South parliamentary seat on a UDA party ticket. The comedian confirmed on Wednesday that he has officially joined DP William Ruto-led party after wider consultations. "It’s now clear where the vision is heading. After many days of consultative meetings with my South Imenti people, I have officially been invited to join UDA," he said. The Starehe MP's move is a plus for the DP after teaming up with the Amani National Congress party on Sunday.
