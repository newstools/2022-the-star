Government Spokesperson, Cyrus Oguna has said that 4,579 Kenyans lost their lives to road accidents in 2021. In a statement on road safety as schools re-open, Oguna said that some of those who died as a result of the accidents were students who were on their way home. "By end of last year (2021), the country had lost 4,579 lives through avoidable road crashes, with 16,046 nursing injuries. Some of those who perished were students on their way home," he said. The spokesperson noted that safety on the roads remains a great concern to the government. He added that overspeeding has been the main cause of these accidents. "We are losing many of our people on road crashes, leaving many households without a breadwinner, and children orphaned." Oguna called on all motorists to drive responsibly and ensure students get to school safely. He urged travellers to speak out against reckless driving. "As schools re-open this week, we appeal to all drivers of both public and private vehicles, to adhere to traffic rules and regulations," Oguna said. A survey by the National Transport and Safety Authority in December revealed that 4,121 people had been killed in various accidents as of November 30, 2021, compared to 3,478 who died in the same period in 2020. This was an 18.5 per cent increase in road fatalities as of November 30, 2021. Of the 4,121, pedestrians were 1,413. NTSA said the deaths were caused by reckless driving, dangerous overtaking, drunk driving, drunk walking, drunk riding, failure to use helmets among other issues.
