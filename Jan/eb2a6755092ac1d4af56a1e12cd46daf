Kenya Railways has conducted its first trial freight train on the newly constructed link connecting the Standard Gauge Railway and Meter Gauge Railway in Naivasha. The cargo destined for Malaba was loaded at the Mombasa port and transported via the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) before being transhipped onto the Metre Gauge Railway (MGR) line at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot (NICD). Speaking at the event, Kenya Railways Managing Director Philip Mainga said that with a capacity to handle 120,000 containers annually, the Naivasha ICD facility will handle transit cargo to Uganda, South Sudan, DR Congo, Northern Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi. This, he said accounts for 30 per cent of imports and exports through the Mombasa port. Mainga said that the new railway line linking the Standard Gauge Railway to the Metre Gauge Railway at the Naivasha Inland Container Depot will enhance efficiency and ease the transhipment. “Our clients will now enjoy seamless transportation of cargo from the Port of Mombasa to Malaba and onward to the East African region in a safe, reliable and cost-effective way," he said. Mainga said the railway line offers safety, efficiency and reliability. It also cuts the reliance on road transport on the 572 kilometre stretch He said transporters and importers can now pick their cargo at Malaba 36 hours upon the train's departure from Mombasa.  Customers may also choose to use rail from Malaba to Kampala. Mainga said that at the Naivasha ICD, local clients will be offered 30 days free storage with quick cargo processing and transhipment onto wagons. “We will have regular, speedy and reliable delivery of cargo through well-organised train schedules with strict timetables for the evacuation of cargo and empty container repatriation from the Inland Container Terminals,” he said.
