The Kenya National Highways Authority is putting up road signs on black spots along the Mombasa-Malindi highway to curb road carnage. KeNHA Coast region director Erick Wambua on Monday said a contractor is already on the ground working on the signages. Wambua further said marking of the highway is also ongoing. “The road has several known black spots. We have dispatched a contractor who will put signs on the road. We have some activities ongoing in all the known blackspots. We will also do some expansion of the road from Mtwapa to Kilifi,” he said. According to the director, the marking of the road will enable road users to be vigilant. “We will do our part. Road users should be vigilant and make sure they follow traffic rules to reduce accidents. If we put signs and drivers choose to ignore them, they will be of little help,” he said. Kilifi North Subcounty Police Commander Jonathan Koech said the Komaza area, about two kilometres from Kilifi town, has been a death trap for many motorists. “This stretch is a known blackspot. It is rough and has several bends and ascends. The authority should give priority to this area,” he said. Koech said two motorcycle riders perished at the area on Sunday after a head on collision. “The accident was between two motorcycles. One was heading towards Mombasa direction from Kilifi and the other towards Kilifi. The motorbike from Kilifi was trying to overtake a vehicle when it collided with the other motorcycle. The riders died on the spot while the three pillion passengers were taken to Kilifi county hospital,” he said. Koech said bushes along the road block drivers from seeing the road clearly, especially at night. He urged motorists to be extra vigilant while approaching the area.    -Edited by SKanyara
