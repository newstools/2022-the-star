The orders that restrained the government from enforcing the mandatory COVID Vaccination certificate are still in force. Justice Antony Mrima has confirmed that the orders are still in force pending the hearing and determination of the matter. The court was coming up for mention today and parties wanted clarification on whether the directive was still in force because the order said until January 4. Judge Mrima has further consolidated all 5 matters that are related to that case. Lawyer Harrison Kinyanjui representing one of the petitioners had raised concern on how some malls and hotels are already implementing the directive by asking Kenyans to produce certificates even though there is an order barring the same. He said they may be forced to file a contempt of court application against the state if they do not stop implementing the directive. He also noted that the malls and those in the hospitality industry who were implementing the directive are not parties to the case. The judge did not issue any directions on that issue and directed the matter to be heard on February 1.
