DP William Ruto was on Tuesday forced to intervene after a man chained himself to his  Harambee Annex office gate for lack of a job. Ruto's spokesperson Emmanuel Talam said the issue has been handled. "DP has sorted the issued and asked his office to handle the young man's case," Talam said. Lawrence Oprong was earlier taken by police officers who whisked him away to the Central police station. He had chained his waist to the gate grills, saying he will only free himself if Ruto addresses his concerns. Oprong who claims to be the son of former Busia North Member of Parliament Fredrick Oduya Oprong said he had been promised a job four years ago. But he noted that the promise had not been fulfilled.
