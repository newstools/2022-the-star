This follows claims that some unnamed people were planning to disrupt the meeting that will be graced by ODM leader Raila Odinga. MPs Peter Kimari (Mathioya) and Nduati Ngugi (Gatanga) have however, assured attendants that sufficient security will be provided and urged those with such plans not to be misused by politicians.
