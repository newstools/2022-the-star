Comedian-cum-radio presenter Felix Odiwuor, alias Jalang'o has denied any links to Deputy President William Ruto and his close associates. This comes after reports emerged on social media that he is warming up for the DP's camp even as he eyes Lang'ata parliamentary seat. While setting the record straight in a radio interview on Wednesday, Jalang’o dismissed the allegations. He said the rumours were being propagated by his opponents who have sensed defeat. “The photos that you are seeing being circulated are the ones that I took with DP Ruto when I met him for an interview long ago,” Jalang’o said. Jalang'o continued that in a photo that he appeared with the Lang’ata MP was during his wedding where he was the master of ceremony. “Kwa sasa siwezi onekana karibu an hao tena (For now, I can not be seen with them again),” he added. The media personality maintained that he is only aware of the Azimio la Umoja coalition being led by the ODM leader Raila Odinga. According to a post on the social media that the fact-checker has verified as propaganda, Jalang’o met with Deputy President William Ruto and discussed a way forward regarding his Lang’ata parliamentary bid. Jalang’o has expressed interest in the seat that is held by a first-term MP Nixon Korir. The post also claimed that he met with MP Korir, a close ally of the DP. Jalang’o assured his supporters that he will be on the ballot come August 9 elections and urged them to ignore propaganda being pushed by his competitors.
