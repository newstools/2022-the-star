Immediate Rift Valley commissioner George Natembeya has officially joined DAP- K, which supports Azimio la Umoja, together with a host of leaders from Trans Nzoia county. Azimio La Umoja is a movement that is backing the ODM leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. Among those who joined DAP- K together with Natembeya is Trans Nzoia Women Rep Janet Nangabo who was elected on a Jubilee party ticket. Speaking after joining their new partY, Nangabo and Natembeya pledged to popularize the party and Azimio movement in Trans Nzoia county. "Let us stop threatening one another because of politics. We want politics of ideas that will change the lives of our people," Natembeya said. Nangabo on her part said: "We are ready to compete with others. We want them to bring their ideas and we front ours". The leaders were welcomed by DAP-K top leaders including Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi and Defence CS Eugene Wamalwa. CS Wamalwa affirmed the position of DAP-K in national politics saying they are solidly behind Azimio. "This is Azimio government. We are entering government because our competitors have lost network," he stated. This comes even as Raila on Thursday also welcomed a delegation of Rift Valley leaders to his Aziumio La Umoja movement. The team included Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar, Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) of Livestock and fisheries Linah Jebii Kilimo Linah Chebii Kilimo, former MP Aldai Mp Sally Kosgey and former police IG David Kimaiyo. The leaders met Raila at Chungwa House office in Nairobi. Earlier in the day, ODM's director of communications Philip Etale had said they were set to receive new entrants into the party. "Today we shall receive more into the party. And we shall continue growing," he said. Edited by B. Marita
