ODM boss Raila Odinga has once again hit out against Deputy President William Ruto's hustler campaigns, saying he is determined to agitate for class war. The former prime minister said the best way to empower the poor is by providing opportunities and not fighting the rich. "In an economy, there will always be the rich and the poor, but you don't deprive the rich to give the poor," Raila said. He went on: "..but what this one (Ruto) is doing is purely agitating for class war." The DP has been insisting that the country is ripe for a radical shift in its economic management saying the bottom-up model is the best remedy to empower the poor. He has trashed the current system which he has termed as a trickle-down economic model that he argues has only enriched a few Kenyans. The ODM boss said his government, under the Azimio La Umoja, will create opportunities for the poor to create wealth and broaden the middle-income bracket. "The Azimio journey is on to unite the country and bring all Kenyans together," he said. The ex-PM spoke on Monday in Naivasha after a meeting with nearly 30 governors supporting his Azimio La Umoja movement. He said his administration will seek to strengthen devolution and push for the establishment of industries in every sub-county. "We will have one sub-county, one industry, one product to spur the country's industrialisation," he said. During the meeting, Raila asked governors to spearhead the ongoing mass voter registration in their regions which started on Monday. "Today is a very important day because the exercise for voter registration has started, let us go down there and mobilise our young people to register to participate in the most important election in our history," he said.
