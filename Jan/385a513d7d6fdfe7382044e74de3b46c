Charles Njonjo took long to establish his nuclear family and once he did, he held it together. His son-in-law Carey Ngini, who is married to his secondborn daughter Mary Wambui, said Njonjo called a family get-together on Saturday, January 1, and they had a fireside chat. Ngini said they talked about various things and although his father-in-law was lively and strong, he was showing signs of weaknesses.
