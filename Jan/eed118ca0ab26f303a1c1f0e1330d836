Ford Kenya Party has endorsed its partnership with Deputy President William Ruto’s UDA party. The party, which is led by Moses Wetang'ula, held its Parliamentary group meeting on Tuesday morning and backed the new political partnership. Ford Kenya secretary-general Chris Wamalwa told the Star that the PG, comprising National Assembly and Senate members, ratified the political pact. “We have just held our Parliamentary group meeting and endorsed the deal with UDA and ANC. We shall be providing further details as we progress,” said Wamalwa. Musalia Mudavadi’s ANC party is expected to hold its PG next week to ratify the deal. Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala told the Star that the party will hold the PG soon after the joint rally in Bungoma. “The PG will take place after the Bungoma rally on Friday,” he said. The three parties are planning a series of joint campaign rallies in key regions starting from Nakuru on Wednesday before moving to Bungoma on Friday. UDA held its PG on Monday and ratified the partnership with Ford Kenya and ANC.
