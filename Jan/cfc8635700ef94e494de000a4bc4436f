A woman suspected to have caused her neighbour's death after a fighting incident in Kabarage slums in Kangemi, Nairobi, has been detained for eight days pending investigations. Milimani senior resident magistrate Jane Kamau remanded Clementine Nandutu at Gigiri police station after a successful application by the police. In an affidavit filed in court, investigating officer Charles Muchoya sought 14 days to conclude investigations saying it was a serious offence. The court was informed that Nandutu is a resident of Kibarage slums where the deceased Mary Njambi also resided and if released, she might interfere with the investigations. “The suspect fought with the deceased on December 27 last year thereby occasioning her bodily harm suspected to have caused her death on January 1, 2022”, the officer told the court. Muchoya further said the deceased died in her mother’s house. The officer wants to conduct a mental examination on the suspect and get a post mortem report on the deceased to establish the cause of death. The suspect’s phone and that of the deceased are yet to be submitted for forensic analysis. Nandutu defended herself against being detained and told the court that she was innocent and that the police are acting maliciously by seeking her detention. The magistrate, however, said the 14 days requested would be too long and only granted eight days. The case will be mentioned on January 12.
