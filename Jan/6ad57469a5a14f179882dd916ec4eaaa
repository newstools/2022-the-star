Sports stakeholders have urged the governmental departments and corporates to employ sportsmen to protect them from exploitation. Recruitment of sportsmen to the corporate world will ensure a steady income thus reducing chances of exploitation as well as Gender-Based Violence. James Kahonge, the general manager for mail services at the Kenya Postal Corporation, said the employment of athletes will ensure most of them have adequate cash flow even when they are not competing. “With a steady income, chances of any athlete being lured with promises are very minimal. It is time we as the corporate world became part of our athletes,” he said. Kahonge said of lack of financial stability makes most athletes vulnerable to exploitative managers, who in most cases have personal interests. Kahonge spoke on Tuesday during  Day 2 of Agnes Tirop Conference in Diani, Kwale county He further said organizations should also make it easy for athletes to excel in their fields of sports. He said this can only be achieved by having policies and structures which allow the athletic employees to compete and are still guaranteed their job security. “The policies will assure our sportsmen and women will still have their jobs as they represent the country. This will make them at ease and have them concentrate on winning,” he said. Kahonge noted some organizations recognize and promote athletes whenever they win which in return has boosted the morale of the athletes. He further said corporates should also be willing to sponsor teams to ease the financial burden off the shoulders of team management and its players. Kihonge said corporate sponsorship will ensure the players are focused knowing their needs are catered for by the sponsor. At the moment, Posta Kenya sponsors a football team, Posta Rangers, and volleyball among other teams. Most of Kenya’s sports teams have faced challenges in acquiring sponsors forcing them to seek assistance through public fundraising.
