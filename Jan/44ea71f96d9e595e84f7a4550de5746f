Governor James Ongwae has urged residents to use the second and last phase of voter registration to enlist. The 21-day- exercise started on Monday. Ongwae said through registration, residents will practice their democratic right of electing leaders of their choice. He urged those who missed the first phase which ended on November 5 last year, to visit the nearest registration centres to enlist. The governor urged the residents not to wait until the last minute. Ongwae urged the national government to use chiefs, their assistants and clan elders to ensure uncollected IDs reach their owners to enable them to register. “It will be easy because they know where the owners come from,” the governor said. The county boss discouraged people from applying for IDs and failing to collect them at the right time. “They need to understand that IDs are not only used to register as voters but other processes,” he said. Ongwae said the second phase will be used to know how many Kenyans will be voting in the August polls. However, a spot check by the Star established that there had been a low turnout since the exercise started. Meanwhile, in Kisii, nine aspirants are seeking to succeed Ongwae. They are Deputy Governor Josh Maangi, Senator Sam Ongeri, Transport and Infrastructure CAS Chris Obure, MPs Simba Arati of Dagoretti North and Ezekiel Machogu. Others are Nyaribari Masaba, Woman Rep Janet Ong’era, former South Mugirango MPs Manson Nyamweya, Omingo Magara and Kisii Governance Watch Secretary Rachael Otundo. Ongwae urged the aspirants to sell their policies and agendas and avoid assassinating their opponent's character. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
