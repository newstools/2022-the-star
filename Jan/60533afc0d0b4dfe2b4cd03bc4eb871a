The Party of National Unity (PNU) has said its meeting scheduled for Thursday this week is still on. The party dismissed reports that the meeting had been called off and asked party members to treat the claims with the contempt it deserves. In a press statement on Tuesday, national chairperson David Kamau said that: “We urge you to ignore the misleading statements purporting to cancel the scheduled aspirants meeting that was advertised by the party on January 14, 2022,” Kamau said. He also said that the party is pleased with the support that it has been getting from the friends of the party including Agriculture CS Peter Munya and Governor Nderitu Muriithi of Laikipia County. “We also acknowledge many elected and nominated members who have been contributing to this party through the respective assemblies. We assure that the party will never let them down.” On Thursday, the party will hold a key strategy meeting to unveil the roadmap to the August 9 polls. The party's National Executive Council-the top decision-making organ-will hold a forum in Nairobi with aspirants drawn from the county and the metropolitan region. This would be an all-important meeting for the party which is seeking a stamp its presence in national politics since the exit of retired President Mwai Kibaki in 2013. At the same time, the chairperson invited MCAs’ MPs, senators, and governors who have expressed their interest to run on a PNU ticket in the forthcoming election. PNU is supporting the Azimio la Umoja movement that is being led by the ODM party leader Raila Odinga.
