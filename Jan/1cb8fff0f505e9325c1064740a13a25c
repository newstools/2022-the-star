National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has directed use of electronic voting as House begins discussions on the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Muturi on Wednesday morning directed members without chamber electronic cards to contact the Clerk’s office. “Would there be any division, members will only use an electronic voting system,” Muturi directed. Electronic voting is viewed as the only way to defeat the filibustering tactics of pro-Deputy President William Ruto MPs who have been making deliberate attempts to frustrate the Bill. The bill is seen as part of the strategy to turn Azimio la Umoja, Raila Odinga's 2022 machine, into a coalition party. MPs are expected to continue with the debate on the divisive law that has seen the House divided right in the middle. The legislators are headed for yet another showdown as they begin the third round of debate on the controversial Bill. Both sides have been strategising on how to carry the day when the House resumes for a three-day special sitting after two similar processes ended in disarray with little progress. A well-coordinated but outnumbered Tangatanga team has succeeded in frustrating the Coalition Bill in the last two special meetings. Edited by D Tarus
