A Canadian national on Wednesday was ordered detained for a week for allegedly slitting a reveller's throat at a Nairobi bar over a woman. Abdulahi Ali allegedly attacked Muriiki Muriuki, using a broken glass at a club in Kilimani on December 27, police documents read. Kibera resident magistrate William Tulel directed that Abdulahi be detained at Kilimani police station until Monday next week when he will be charged with attempted murder. Abdulahi was arraigned but did not take a plea because the magistrate on duty was a junior who lacked jurisdiction to preside over the case. Tulel thus deferred the plea-taking to January 10 when a senior magistrate will be available. The police report said Muriuki was with a woman at the Gemini Club at Adlife Plaza in Kilimani when Abdulahi confronted them. The circumstances were not clear. Sources said investigators have obtained CCTV footage that shows the suspect confronting the complainant. Muriuki appeared to be trying to protect the woman. Abdulahi is seen picking up a broken glass with which he attacked Muriuki. He attempted to slit his throat and left him with injuries to the neck. Police said they have concluded investigations. Abdulahi is a Canadian citizen who came to Kenya in December for holiday, authorities said. The suspect, through his lawyer Mohammed Jelle, had requested the case be transferred to the Milimani law courts where he wanted his client charged instead of him remaining in police custody. The magistrate declined and urged the lawyer to seek police bail instead. According to the court documents, Ali is accused of attempting to murder Muriuki at the Gemini Club at Adlife Plaza in Kilimani on the night of December 27 last year. He has since been in police custody. Muriuki was in ICU for several days after he was slit twice on the neck during the altercation. He was discharged on January 1, the court heard. (Edited by V.
