Eric Omondi has denied owning a Sh141 million mansion in Karen, which he had told fans is his. "That Karen mansion is not mine, but I took girls there for two weeks," he said in a recent press conference. Last year, the comedian gave the press a tour of the mansion, in which he later shot his 'Wife Material' show. At the time, Omondi showed a title deed in his name that was stamped on September 7, 2021. He went on to say he had worked for 14 years to own a mansion like that. "This is nothing. If you went to America, Kevin Hart owns five houses. The American culture believes that hard work pays."
