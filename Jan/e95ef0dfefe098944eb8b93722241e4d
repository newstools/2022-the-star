This is one of the tastiest easy to prepare pastry that's loaded with flavour and texture. If you're craving cake but ain’t in the mood to wait the whole cooking time, this is definitely something you can quickly whip up guaranteed you have all the ingredients. Another plus with this recipe is you can use chocolate of your choice, whether dark, milk or white just ensure it infuses well with the peanut butter flavour. Ingredients Method In a small bowl, add all the ingredients (minus the chocolate) and whisk them all together until the batter has a smooth, creamy texture with no flour chunks. Note: if you aren’t comfortable with using baking powder you can opt to use self-raising flour instead of the all-purpose flour. Transfer the mixture into a microwave-safe mug then stir in the chocolate chunks. Place the cup in the microwave and let it cook for 1 minute and 20 secs. This time was perfect for me cause the cake was set just right. Take it off the microwave and allow it to cool for a few minutes before you dig in. Note: The cake is best eaten warm as it tends to get really hard and if you let it cool for too long, you might lose the original taste and flavours. Serve with your beverage of choice and enjoy.
