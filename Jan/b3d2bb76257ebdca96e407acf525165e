I decided to be in the leading pack and break midway through the race. When I saw my opponents falling apart, I decided to open the gap,” said Atuya. “My dream is to finish in the top 10 at the nationals. I know it will not be easy but I want to try. I also want to impress a manager because currently, I train alone,” he added.
