Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday toured Vihiga county. He made various stopover where he spoke to his supporters over his presidential bid. In one of his stops, Ruto urged Kenyans will resist attempts to reintroduce an imperial presidency through the backdoor. He said plans were being hatched by some individuals 'who think they can control Kenyans' to reintroduce the imperial presidency. Ruto said Kenyans voted overwhelmingly for the 2010 Constitution to among others, get rid of the imperial presidency. "Some few rich people, out of arrogance think that they can sit in a certain hotel in Nairobi and appoint their puppet president to run the affairs of our nation and protect their interests and wealth," Ruto said. He said Kenyans were more enlightened than before and they want a government that can transform their lives. "Kenyans are eager and willing to vote for leaders who have plans and agenda that can transform the lives of ordinary people, who form the majority population of this country," DP said. "The reality is that voters want a servant president who will listen to them and solve their problems, unlike a puppet one who will worship and bow down to his masters.”  Edited by CM
