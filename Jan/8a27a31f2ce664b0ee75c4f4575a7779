Record Kenyan champions, Gor Mahia, have parted ways with head coach Mark Harrison following a string of poor results. Harrison has been sent packing alongside his assistant Sammy 'Pamzo' Omolo and goalkeeper trainer Jerim Onyango. Former Tusker tactician Paul Nkata has been handed the reigns on an interim basis. The trio's departure comes barely a day after speculations had emerged surrounding their future. Speaking on Thursday, Omolo player down talk of their departure, saying it was being peddled by enemies of progress. “It's quote obvious that we are experiencing a poor run due to the deep-rooted financial constraints,” said Omolo. The Star has since established that there is a looming mass walk out of star players owing to unpaid salaries saying back to several months now. A player who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal said he would opt out of the club at the export of his contract which will run out in two months' time. “I actually regret joining Gor. I actually received a call from a well-oiled rival club moments after I had completed my deal with Gor. I should have waited a little bit kongwe before I penned the deal,” said the player. Gor who experienced a flying start to the season and maintained the top spot in the initial phases, have since struggled to stay afloat in the top five after blowing hot and cold in their recent fixtures. They are currently fifth on the log with 28 points, six adrift of leaders Kakamega Homeboyz.
