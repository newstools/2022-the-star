Edday Nderitu, the wife of Mugiithi singer Samidoh, had a heated exchange of words with fans on Wednesday after she publicly revealed her preferred candidate for the Nairobi senatorial seat. Edday declared she'll be supporting her best friend Julie Kabogo, who is running for the same Nairobi senatorial seat as Samidoh's baby mama Karen Nyamu in the August election. The mother of two shared a photo with her friend Julie Kabogo and revealed she was her preferred candidate for the seat. "My senator (Nairobi senator 2022)❤️#chamachakazi #mbokanadoo #bossma," she wrote. Fas asked why she isn't supporting her 'co-wife' Karen Nyamu? Conso Warema said, "Why don't you support Karen Nyamu mukule poa hadi Hubby?" This didn't go down well with Edday, who wrote back, "Alikwambia tunakulanga kwake?"
