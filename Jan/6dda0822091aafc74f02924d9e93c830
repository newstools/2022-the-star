The residents of Nakuru county on Wednesday thronged the ASK showground for the UDA party mega rally. Deputy President William Ruto was on Wednesday accompanied by ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula during the Nakuru rally. Supporters of the three parties came out in large numbers to witness the three attend the same rally after Musalia invited Ruto to his event last Sunday. This move forced Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, Kanu leader Gideon Moi and businessman Jimi Wanjigi to leave the event in protest. During the event, Keroche founder Tabitha Karanja announced her entry to the UDA party. Karanja said she is vying for the Nakuru senatorial seat. She was welcomed into the stage by the current Nakuru Senator Susan Kihika who described her as a resilient and hardworking woman who will transform Nakuru into a business hub.
