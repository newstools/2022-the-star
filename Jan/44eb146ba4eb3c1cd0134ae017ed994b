A Cameroonian has been charged with possessing over Sh283 million in fake currency. Timson Tiekam Babila was accused of possessing pieces of papers in 100 denominations equivalent to USD 2.5 million intended to pass as genuine USA currency notes. He allegedly committed the offence on January 12 at Athi River in Machakos County jointly with others, not before the court. He denied the charges before senior principal magistrate Benard Ochoi and was released on a bond of Sh10 million pending the hearing and determination of the case. The accused person was arrested by detectives from the DCI’s Economic and Commercial Crimes Unit (ECCU) for allegedly falsely obtaining money from a Kenyan-based Australian businessman. According to the police report, Babila, who is alleged to be the mastermind of the syndicate, lured unsuspecting businessmen with the promise of cleaning fake dollar notes and converting them into genuine cash. Police said in order to make it happen, the suspect first asks his victims for genuine money for the purchase of chemicals and other materials used to clean the fake notes, usually locked in steel boxes.
