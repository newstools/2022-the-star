Former Vihiga Queens title-winning coach Alex Alumira has been appointed the new Harambee Starlets tactician by the Football Kenya Federation caretaker committee. Alumira, who guided Queens to three consecutive titles (2017, 2018 and 2019) and also prepared the county-sponsored side for CECAFA before departing, takes over from Charles Okere. He beat stiff competition from four other local coaches in interviews conducted at the Nyayo Stadium last week. Alumira, who boasts of a FIFA diploma in football medicine, currently coaches Serengeti Lite Women's Premier League side Tiger Queens in Tanzania. Prior to the move in Tanzania, he was linked with a host of teams from North and West Africa. Alumira's decorated CV, coupled with his ability to nurture talent for the long term could probably be one of the reasons he was handed over the mantle. Cynthia Shilwatso, Jentrix Shikangwa, Lilian Awour are among diaspora-based players who passed through Alumira's hands. In 2018, he coached Harambee Starlets Select (Team B). Alumira, who suffered just six losses in 118 matches at Queens, has also served as an assistant coach at Vihiga United and Vihiga All Stars. The 39-year old will be assisted by Thika Queens' Benta Achieng and Mathare United women's team coach Ann Aluoch. Achieng, who first replaced Richard Kanyi as Thika's head coach in 2017, has adequate knowledge in women's football. She not only guided Thika to the WPL title last season but the then Dorcus Shikobe-captained side romped to the gong unbeaten. Aluoch, on the other hand, is best remembered for captaining Starlets to their first-ever appearance at the African Women's Cup of Nations in Cameroon in 2016. A year later, she was appointed as the inaugural Kenya U-20 Women’s national team head coach. She became the youngest-ever woman head coach, at 27, to guide a national team worldwide. Alumira's immediate assignment is to ensure Starlets qualify for AWCON for the second time.
