Forget meat and the usual veggies like kales that you have every other day and explore a new recipe. This meal is not only nutritionally packed but it is also very colourful and tasty. It is easy to put together and doesn't require a lot of time cooking as these veggies can even be partaken raw. Broccoli and capsicums go really well together. Ingredients Method Carefully wash all your vegetables then set them aside. Peel your garlic cloves and mash them in a pestle and mortar. Slice your onion into large semi circles and place in a pan, then add cooking oil and place over medium source of heat. Slice the capsicums into thin finger-like slices and chop the broccoli and capsicums into florets. Add salt and all the spices into the onions and stir, pour in your soy sauce and stir gently. Add capsicums and the crushed garlic in the pan stir and let them sit for a while. Next, add the broccoli and cauliflower, stir and leave for a while. Add half a cup of water to the pan and bring to boil for a few minutes. You don't want to boil the vegetables for long as they'll lose their crunchiness. Turn off the heat and set the pan aside. In a cooking pot, add 2 cups of water and bring to boil. Add 1 cup of washed rice, salt and coconut oil and allow to boil. Turn heat into a low setting, cover the rice and allow it to dry. Use a fork to check if you're unsure. Serve and enjoy the meal.
