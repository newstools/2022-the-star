The government has commended China Ghezoubha Group Company for diverting Athi and Thwake River water to change its course to two mega tunnels to allow embankment works at Thwake Multi-Purpose dam. The dam which is being constructed at the borders of Makueni and Kitui is now 65 per cent complete and will be ready by June. Once the dam is complete, over 1.3 million people will benefit from the supply of treated water to reduce water-borne diseases. Makueni county commissioner Maalim Mohammed reiterated the government's commitment to fast-tracking the project towards successful completion. He spoke on Friday during the closure and diversion of Athi and Thake Rivers to tunnels at the site. “As stakeholders, the various Ministries, State Department and agencies are working together to ensure the contractor is paid on time to fast track the construction work and have no reason to delay,” Mohammed said. He said the government is in the final stages of acquiring additional 60 acres of land at Sh45 million to facilitate the construction of spillways, employers’ camps and dam expansion. “The National Treasury has handed the money to the National Land Commission and the process of compensating persons affected by the project and signed the awards to pave way for the construction have started,” he said. He lauded all the leaders and the community for complementing the vision 2030 flagship dam project that will benefit Makueni, Kitui and Machakos residents. China Ghezoubha Group Company Managing director Frank Keeh said they were committed to promoting Kenyan socioeconomic growth and development through the construction of the Megaproject. “We appreciate the government and local authorities for their support in executing this project,” Keeh said. The project which is currently employing close to 1,161 people directly into the dam construction, is supporting local industries through sourcing of construction materials. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
