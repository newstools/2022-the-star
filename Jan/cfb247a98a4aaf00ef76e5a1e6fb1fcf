When we hear of Oppo devices, the first thing that clicks in our minds is affordable phones for the middle class. They have however moved a scale upwards and come up with a high-end phone, Oppo Find X2. This device packs the same specifications and ports as the OnePlus 8 Pro. The difference is the design switches out a matte finish for a high gloss glass back. It has the best-in-class screen, charges within as little as 38 minutes and has a premium glass and metal design. On the front, it has the Gorilla Glass 6, while at the back it has the Gorilla glass 5 with both sides curved to create a comfortable in-hand feel and a tiny bezel look. The 120Hz refresh rate on this device puts it at the top of the pack when it comes to screen smoothness, being better than pricier phones like iPhone 11 Pro. Within the settings, you can switch between refresh rates of 120Hz, 60 Hz or Auto. What is smart about Auto is that it switches between the refresh rates, depending on what the app or interface element is optimised to run at. It has the monochrome option that works together with the blue-light filter for a noticeably warm black and white mode that keeps eye strain at bay. Though it has the IMX 586 sensor found on some of the budget phones, it does not mean that it will give you budget phone camera performance. It has optical image stabilisation, phase detection and laser autofocus features. The primary camera is matched with a 13MP, 52mm telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide lens that loses out from a resolution and zoom power footing when compared to the competition. It has a snapdragon 865 chipset, which puts it on par with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. It keeps its cool climbing up to around 38 degrees when wrapping up a 65W charge. One downside is there is no MicroSD card slot, but you may need one given the 256GB internal storage. If you are used to wired earphones, the lack of a headphone jack will also be a negative. It is retailing at Sh93,999.
