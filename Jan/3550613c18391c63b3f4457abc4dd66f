A man has hacked his elder brother to death in Nandi, in a row over Sh10 bhang cash. Kevin Mwale, 31, was attacked by his younger brother Brian Ilodanga Mwale, 28 on Saturday. Kevin was demanding to be paid the balance after buying bhang. The deceased was rushed to Kapkangani health centre where he was referred to Kapsabet Level 5 Hospital for specialised treatment. He had suffered deep cuts and was pronounced dead at the hospital. Nandi central police boss Doris Chemos said the assailant picked a machete and hacked his brother after he was unable to explain the whereabouts of the Sh10. “He confronted the deceased for pestering him over the money which he had spent,” Chemos said. Neighbours fled after Kevin attacked and overpowered his brother. Mother, Jane Minayo,60, said she watched as her sons fought over the balance from Sh50. The suspect was later arrested by villagers who threatened to lynch him if he did not surrender. Brian surrendered and was handed over to detectives at Chepsonoi police station. Police have recovered the machete the assailant used in the attack. The police boss said it would be used as part of the exhibit in the prosecution. The mother blamed the consumption of bhang and alcohol by the youths for the increased cases of domestic violence in the area. “Kevin was a polite hard-working son,” Minayo said. The deceased body is at the Kapsabet County Referral Mortuary awaiting postmortem. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
