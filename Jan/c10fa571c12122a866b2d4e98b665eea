The wealth of former President Daniel Moi has been exposed for the first time in an intricate court battle for a share of the multi-billion estate. One of Moi's grandchildren—the eldest son of Jonathan Moi (deceased) — says in court documents that the true value of his grandfather's wealth is over Sh300 billion. There have always been lots of questions about what exactly Moi owned, having been at the helm for a record 24 years as president and 11 years as vice president.
