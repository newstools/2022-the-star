ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi is set to launch his presidential bid at the Bomas of Kenya today. Mudavadi has told his supporters to brace for a major announcement, which will give him the mandate to spearhead and engage in any coalition arrangement that will benefit Kenyans and the party. The party is also expected to unveil its ‘political friends’ during the conference. The ANC leader has five clear options; contest for the top seat on ANC, vie on One Kenya Alliance ticket, support another Oka principal, back ODM leader Raila Odinga or rally behind Deputy President William Ruto. Preparations for the ANC delegates’ conference was complete by Saturday evening. The National Delegates Convention at the Bomas of Kenya is also expected to set the stage for the One Kenya alliance to now name its flag-bearer. Other Oka principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Moses Wetang'ula (Ford Kenya) and Gideon Moi (Kanu) also nurse presidential ambitions and have been endorsed by their respective parties. Mudavadi’s expected announcement has triggered curiosity among Kenyans and anxiety for his supporters since he has consistently expressed his desire to go all the way to the ballot.
