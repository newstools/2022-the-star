Police in Molo have arrested man suspected to have killed his wife and three children on early on Saturday. The man is said to have then torched the house in Kapsita area before raising alarm. Nakuru County Police Commander, Beatrice Kiraguri said the man hid and attempted to flee towards Elburgon town. "Residents suspected foul play in the fire and started questioning the man prompting his disappearance," she said. She said the man was apprehended on his way to Elburgon and is being held at Molo Police Station while the bodies were moved to Elburgon District Hospital mortuary, awaiting post mortem examinations. Kiraguri said the incident could have been caused by a domestic disagreement. Residents milled around the burnt house and described the assailant as a hard working man whose troubles started due to alcohol abuse. A neighbour, Pater Kamau, said the woman aged 32 and her children aged between nine and three years could have been murdered before the house was set on fire. "There was fracas at the home at some minutes after midnight, people heard screams only to come about two hours later and found the house burning," he said. Beth Wangui said it was disturbing to see the bodies of the slain woman and her children. She urged men to separate with their spouses in case of trouble in the family instead of killing. Cases of murder and suicide have increased in the region over the past few years.  Edited by B. Oruta
