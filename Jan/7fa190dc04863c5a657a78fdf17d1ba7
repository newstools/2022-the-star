A City Shuttle Sacco clerk has been charged with stealing Sh613,000 from the employer. Joseph Mwangi is accused of committing the offence between September 13 and December 9, 2021, at Queensway house along Kaunda street. He allegedly committed the offence by being a servant to City shuttle Sacco whereby the money in question was in his possession by virtue of his employment as a clerk. Mwangi denied the charges before Milimani senior resident magistrate Jane Kamau and pleaded for lenient bond terms. He was released on a cash bail of Sh200,000. Meanwhile, in the same court, a fishmonger was charged with fraudulently obtaining Sh2.1 million for the supply of fish feeds. Ann Wangui Nduta appeared before Milimani and senior Resident Magistrate Jane Kamau and denied the charge. She is accused of defrauding Haman Mbugua Wambui Sh2.1 by pretending that she had a business deal of selling fish feeds. The court heard that she committed the offence on diverse dates between October 24, 2020, and April 8 last year within Nairobi County. She committed the fraud jointly with others, not before the court. She was released on a cash bail of Sh500,000 pending hearing and determination of the case. -Edited by B. Marita
