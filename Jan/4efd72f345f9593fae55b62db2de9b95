ODM leader Raila Odinga on Friday pitched a tent in Nyeri county where he continued to sell his Azimio La Umoja movement. Raila had earlier attended the burial of Nyeri County deputy governor Caroline Karugu's mother before addressing a public gathering. The ODM leader received a warm reception in Karatina after hundreds of residents turned up to welcome him. Raila was accompanied by Governors, Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru)  and Anyang Nyong'o (Kisumu). The ODM leader promised to improve the economic situation of Kenyans in the country. He pledged to subsidize prices of basic commodities that farmers need like fertilizer so that the cost of living can be reduced. Leaders present also campaigned for Raila saying he was better placed to turn around the country's economy if elected. Kieni MP Kanini Kega said the Mt Kenya region is ready to vote for Raila presidency. Raila is on Saturday expected to address a mega rally in Murang'a county.
