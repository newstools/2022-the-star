Samburu Sevens Championship has attracted sixty teams slated for July 9-17 at the Kalama Conservancy. Fifty teams will feature in Rugby Union while 10 teams will contest the  Rugby League title. The teams will be divided further into three categories thus elite teams, international teams, and local teams for the eight-day rugby extravaganza which also incorporates Bush Safari for international teams. Event organiser, Kevin Adhere, said some of the teams including Kenya Sevens will use the event as a build-up Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and Rugby World Cup Sevens in Cape Town in September. "It's an opportunity to play some of the top teams in the world and prepare well for the two events," said Adehere. He said prize money for the event will be announced in due course. He added that they expect top Kenya Cup sides to send teams for the event as well as countries like England, Belgium, France, and Germany. He said they are building three quality rugby pitches ahead of the event. “ With such calibre of teams, we must also have quality pitches and we have already started building the infrastructure," noted Adhere. He added: "There will also be a festival village with entertainment every day and a one-stop-shop with bars, food outlets, and medical facilities provided." He lauded the Samburu County government for their support.  Kalama Conservancy chairman Michael Lesiminto said preparations for the event had already started and urged rugby enthusiasts to turn up in huge numbers.
