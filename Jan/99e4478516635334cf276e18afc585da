This is one of those signature meals that everyone globally recognizes that they go hand in hand. It's tasty, rich with flavour and you can load it with as much cheese as you want. Pappardelle or ribbon pasta as some refer to them, are large broad and flat pasta with origins from Tuscany. Ingredients. Method. Marinate the beef in 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce and a 1/4 of salt mixture for 15 minutes before sautéing. Wash, peel and dice the onions, garlic and green pepper into small pieces. In a cooking pot add oil and allow it to heat once hot add the marinated ground beef. Stir and cover the pot allowing the beef to cook. Drain the beef then add salt, onion, garlic, and green pepper into the cooking pot. (Drain grease off the beef before adding any vegetables. This way you won't be pouring out any of your garlic/onion flavour). Cook and stir until the meat browns and the vegetables are tender. Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste into the pot. Add oregano, basil, pepper and a teaspoon of sugar as it helps cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Add two cups of water, lower heat and simmer the sauce for an hour stirring occasionally. Once ready turn off the heat source. In another cooking pot, add water and bring to boil then add the pasta and salt and allow to boil. Once they're ready, drain off excess water and add grated cheese to the pasta, stir with a wide tooth plastic fork. Note: If you want to give it a richer taste stir in a quarter cup of cream before serving. Serve and enjoy.
