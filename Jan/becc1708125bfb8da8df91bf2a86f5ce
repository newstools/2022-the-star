A 32-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly attempting to defile his nine-year-old niece at Rabuor village in the Ndhiwa constituency. The arrest came after the suspect’s wife caught him in the process of attempting to defile the girl who is in grade 1. According to the Assistant Chief of Kajwang’ Sub Location Enos Nyawade, suspect Emmanuel Ochieng’ first instructed the girl to take a bucket into his house. The girl had gone to fetch water from a nearby pond. When the girl entered the house, the suspect followed her and took her into their matrimonial bed. Ochieng’ forcefully removed the minor’s skirt and underwear. The girl sensed danger and began struggling to get out of his hands. The minor raised an alarm by screaming. “The girl entered the house innocently to store the item as she was instructed by the uncle. But she felt danger when the uncle removed her clothing,”  Nyawade said. It is reported that the man took advantage of the wife's absence who had left home for an unknown destination some minutes earlier. In what appeared to be good luck, Ochieng’s wife arrived back home and rushed into the house to find out what was happening. She entered the room before the husband defiled the girl. “His wife suddenly caught him red-handed with the minor. Fortunately, he was still struggling with the minor and had not defiled her,” Nyawade said. The wife informed Nyawade before recording a statement at Kobodo police post. On Thursday, Nyawade said they arrested the suspect and took him to the police post before he was transferred to Ndhiwa Police Station. The suspected is expected to be arraigned in Ndhiwa court after interrogation “We have detained him at Ndhiwa Police Station so that he can be arraigned in court,” Nyawade said. The administrator told residents to respect the rights of children. “Defilement destroys future lives of children. Let men with such an intention stop it,” he added.
