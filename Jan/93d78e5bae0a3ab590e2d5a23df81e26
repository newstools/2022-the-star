A male teacher who wrote a viral Facebook post claiming that TSC boss Nancy Macharia is dead was Tuesday charged with cyber harassment. Jeremiah Mwavuganga Samuel, 31, a teacher at Musiini Primary School in Makueni was arraigned before a Milimani court where he denied the charge. Mwavuganga also denied a second count of publishing false information. It is alleged that on diverse dates between January 16 and 20 this year, jointly with others not before court, using his Facebook account, he wrote false claims on Macharia which were allegedly aimed to cause panic and fear to her. He wrote, “Breaking news Nancy Macharia is DEAD, her body has been found in Oyuu’s bed. It is alleged that Oyuu madad her after she failed to kiss his ass. RIP Macharia… ooh it was just a dream. May it be so.” He denied the charges and asked the court to grant him favourable bond terms. Chief magistrate Susan Shitubi release him on a Sh650,000 bond or an alternative cash bail of Sh100,000. The teacher was arrested over the weekend at Makutano Shopping Centre in Nzaui, Makueni. Police reports allege that upon his arrest, he was found in possession of the handset that was used to create the viral post about Macharia’s death. According to police, Macharia who made the report said the publication was malicious and caused fear and panic to her family and that it had injured her reputation and integrity as a public servant. The case will be mentioned on February 8.   -Edited by SKanyara
