Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang'ula has warned politicians against using youth to cause chaos during campaigns ahead of the August polls. He asked those vying for political seats across the country to present their manifesto to Kenyans instead of inciting people to cause violence. Wetang'ula appealed to security agencies to deal with rogue politicians who hire youth to cause chaos. “As the country stands now, politicians are at risk of causing disunity among Kenyans," he said. "If politicians continue with what they are doing, the police should be on the lookout and arrest all youths who cause chaos during campaigns." Wetang’ula spoke in Kabuchai, Bungoma county, during the burial of former magistrate Joseph Wanjala. The Ford Kenya boss also urged counties to quickly come together and provide subsidised farm inputs, especially fertiliser and quality seeds. "It's nearly impossible for the ordinary mwananchi to afford one bag of fertiliser at Sh5,600. It's high time both levels of government intervene in this issue and solve it," he added. Kabuchai MP Majimbo Kalasinga blamed President Uhuru Kenyatta for pushing for the Building Bridges Initiative while ignoring the issue of fertilisers affecting farmers. (edited by Amol Awuor)
