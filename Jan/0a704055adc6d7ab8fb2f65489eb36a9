Kenya men's hockey team sailed to the semifinals of the African Cup of Nations by hammering minnows Namibia 4-1 on Tuesday. Captain Constant Wakhura opened the scoring by sounding the board in the 14th minute to give Chui a first-quarter lead. However, Tjikuniva Isascar restored parity for Namibia in the 18th minute to level matters heading into halftime. Three quick-fire goals in the last quarter enabled Kenya to overpower their opponents and mark a dream start to the tournament. Allan Iningu (51st) Emmanuel Awino (53rd) and Festus Onyango (57th) completed the rout for Kenya. Jet lag was not an issue for Kenya, who had arrived in Ghana at 11 a.m on Tuesday, just a few hours before their match. They take on defending champions South Africa later on Wednesday. Elsewhere, Ghana were awarded a walkover against Kenya women's team on Tuesday after Kenya failed to honour the match. Kenya must now navigate their way in their remaining two matches against Zambia (Wednesday) and Nigeria (Thursday).
