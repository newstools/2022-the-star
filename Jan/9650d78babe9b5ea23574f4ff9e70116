A non-governmental organization Haki Africa has requested the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji to investigate rising cases of dead bodies being dumped in river Yala. In a statement on Tuesday, January 18, 2022, the director of HAKI Africa Hussein Khalid confirmed several bodies have been retrieved from the river. “We visited Yala on Monday, January 17, 2022. To our dismay, we confirmed that indeed there are tens of unknown bodies that have been retrieved from the river,” Khalid said. He added that the nearby morgue has 21 bodies that have not been identified and which were retrieved from the same river. “Some of the bodies were tied with ropes, others had deep cuts and others had polythene bags on the head.” The activist said locals informed them of two vehicles that were spotted in different instances stopping at the local area's bridge. They say people who alighted from the vehicles were seen dumping what is believed to be bodies of the dead into river Yala. The two vehicles are a double-cabin pick-up and a probox. They said the suspected operation of dumping bodies is done at night between  1 am and 5 am. “We write to seek your intervention and have investigations on the above matter initiated. Kenyans need to know the identity of those killed and those behind the killings and subsequent dumping of the bodies in the river,” Khalid said. The lobby group raised concerns over the matter saying cases of people missing without a trace have been on the rise. They have called on the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to equally intervene and ascertain whether or not there was the involvement of the police in the killings.
