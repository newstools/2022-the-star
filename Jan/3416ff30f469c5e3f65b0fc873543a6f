Four men who are alleged to have trespassed on President Uhuru Kenyatta's land in Karen have been charged with forcible entry. The four are Mohammed Muhammud Wako alias Hussein Mohammed, James Owino Opere, Jonah Saluni Tuuko and Samakin Lesingiran. It is alleged that on January 3 at Windy Ridge Lane in Karen, they jointly violently broke and entered into land belonging to Goodison Trust Corporation Ltd, owned by the first family. The court heard that the land belonged to a prominent leader who could not be mentioned because of security reasons. However, Opere and Tuuko through their lawyer Danstan Omari told the court that the land belonged to the first family. The first accused Mohammed Wako was separately charged with 11 other counts of forgery and conspiracy to defraud. The defence lawyer urged the court to treat the accused differently owing to the fact that the charge sheet present before the court shows that the first accused is charged with 11 counts while the two are charged with one count of forcible entry. The court released Wako on Sh1 million cash bail or Sh2 million bond. The other three were each granted Sh200,000 cash bail or an alternative bond of Sh 500,000. On Wednesday last week,  police were granted two days to detain them for further investigations. The prosecution had asked the court to allow them to detain the four for 7 days for further investigations. They claimed that investigations into the matter were complex and would require further investigations to be undertaken with a view of recovering a forged title and the motive behind the alleged forcible entry saying that the property belongs to a prominent leader -Edited by B.Marita
