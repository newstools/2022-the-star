Minority communities residing in Narok county say they have opened talks with all gubernatorial aspirants ahead of August polls. The groups, under Narok Minority Community Forum, said they have come together to ensure their interests are catered for. The forum was led by chairman Maurice Owinga, Charles Mulamba (secretary), Olick Achiega (organising secretary), Joab Otipi (youth leader) and elder Nicodemus Omboga. “We are now ready to negotiate with all the aspirants to know our stake in their administration because we are part of this county. Most of our people are living and doing business in Narok and are ready to work with the  Maasai community in this year's election,” Owinga said in a press briefing in Narok town over the weekend. While calling on politicians to preach peace and unity, the minority groups urged the locals to take up voters’ cards in readiness for the election to boost their bargaining power. Mulamba said since 2013 they have enjoyed peace, love and harmony in Narok as minority communities. “As this year's general elections approach, we would like to urge leaders vying for various positions especially gubernatorial seats to be on the forefront in championing for cohesion and unity of all communities and avoid tribal utterances that may cause tension among county residents," he said. The groups thanked Governor Samuel Tunai for accommodating all the communities living in Narok since he was elected nine years ago. “As minority groups, we root for leaders with integrity whose leadership qualities go beyond tribe/clan affiliations,” Achiega said. He said the minority groups are ready to have dialogue with all the gubernatorial aspirants on their over 40,000 votes. “The Constitution stipulates that minorities are supposed to get 30 per cent of jobs, tenders in the county and whoever complies with our agenda will get our votes,” he remarked.
