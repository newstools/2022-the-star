Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has appointed the official who will be in charge of the party’s diaspora league. Benson Metho – the former political advisor of ex-Machakos Senator Johnson Muthama– will now be secretary of Wiper Diaspora Dialogue, according to an appointment letter seen by the Star. The communication was made in a letter dated January 13, 2022, and signed by the party’s Secretary-General Shakila Abdalla. “Wiper Democratic Movement is pleased to appoint Benson Metho Jr as the secretary for WDM Diaspora League. Metho is currently a Fintech consultant and has vast experience in strategic partnership, public relations and mobilisations,” Shakila said. “Benson has previously served as the Chairman of Kamba Community in Minnesota and also a founding member of the Kenya Diaspora Development Forum.” Kalonzo, who emerged as the favourite One Kenya Alliance’s flag bearer, is assembling a team of technocrats as he musters a formidable side ahead of the August 9 elections. Metho has been residing in the US for 14 years. He is viewed as the right person to handle the diaspora on behalf of the party. Edited by Mercy Asamba
