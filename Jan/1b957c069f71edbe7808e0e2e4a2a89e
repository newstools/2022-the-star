Uasin Gishu businessman and politician Zedekiah Bundotich alias Buzeki has declined appeals by a section of leaders urging him to join the UDA party. UDA party, affiliated with Deputy President William Ruto, is expected to dominate in the Kalenjin nation counties in the forthcoming polls. Speaking at a function on Friday, Buzeki said he won't be coerced into joining an outfit that does not appeal to his conscience. "Someone was telling me that I have until December to move to UDA. But they have no agenda that has appealed to my heart," he said. "I have heard what they said, but their policies do not appeal to me. Siwezi ingia UDA, ata wasijisumbue (I can't join UDA, they should not even bother)." The politician, who is eyeing the Uasin Gishu governor seat, will be giving his second stab at the same seat in the August 9 polls. His remarks came barely a week after he and a section of leaders from the Rift Valley region, who appear cagey in their support for the DP, were called out at an Eldoret rally. "What I want is all Kenyans to find comfort. If they have agenda that could serve Kenyans and change the lives of the people, I have no problem supporting them," Buzeki added. The rally organized to bless the DP and give him the green light to crisscross the country in the hunt for votes saw the leaders attacked by speaker after speaker. Allies of the DP pleaded with area residents not to vote them in saying they have betrayed the community. Some of their remarks became the subject of an investigation by the police. DPP Noordin Haji directed the police Inspector General Hillary Mutyambai to probe the matter and present a file to him for further action. Among the leaders who were questioned about their remarks at Ruto's rally include Meru Senator Mithika Linturi and his Kericho counterpart Senator Aaron Cheruiyot. Mithika was arrested, arraigned and released on bail. Cheruiyot was summoned by NCIC and questioned.
