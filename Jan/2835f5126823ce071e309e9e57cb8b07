ODM party has distanced itself from a group of people who were introduced by Former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale as Orange party officials. The party, in a statement on Twitter, dismissed the team and labelled them as "imposters". "There has not been any meeting of ODM officials with the former Senator of Kakamega County Dr. Bonny Khalwale. None of our officials in Kakamega has met and endorsed him as he claims on his Twitter handle. Those are imposters,"  ODM tweeted. However, the former Kakamega senator has responded to the ODM statement accusing the outfit of living in denial. Khalwale revealed that a senior ODM official from the region has infact ditched the Orange party and joined his UDA party. "You are living in denial. As a matter of fact, besides that endorsement, the Ikolomani Constituency Chairman Mr Vincent Mukhono has defected to UDA party and  is contesting for Member for National Assembly for Ikolomani," he said. Earlier on, Khalwale had released a statement on Twitter saying he mate the ODM officials from Kakamega county and claimed the team endorsed his gubernatorial ambitions. "This morning, I held a breakfast meeting with Ikolomani North ODM party leaders. Am so grateful that they took the opportunity to endorse me for Kakamega Governor 2022," Khalwale claimed. Khalwale is seeking the Kakamega  governor's seat for the second time now after failing to oust the incumbent governor Wycliffe Oparanya in 2017 polls. He vied on a Ford Kenya ticket during the 2017 polls.
