ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi on Sunday announced that he will be teaming up with deputy president William Ruto ahead of the August 9, elections. The move caused political discomfort in his ANC party resulting in some leaders defecting to ODM leader Raila Odinga's camp. However, a host of leaders expressed solidarity with Mudavadi by endorsing his political decisions. The MPs who supported Mudavadi's decision include Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala who was on the frontline in ensuring the deal with Ruto is sealed.
