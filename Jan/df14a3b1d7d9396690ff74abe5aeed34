The latest opinion poll from the Radio Africa Group shows that Deputy President William Ruto is maintaining his lead in the presidential race. The former Prime Minister Raila Odinga is, however, starting to catch up. According to the poll, 46.1 percent of registered voters say they will vote for Ruto in the presidential election on August 9 while 35.1 percent say they will vote for Raila. At this stage, Ruto's lead will not be sufficient for him to win on the first round with a simple majority (50 percent plus one vote).
