Ulinzi Stars head coach Stephen Ocholla breathed a sigh of relief after his side rallied from a goal down to share spoils with Posta Rangers at Utalii Grounds on Friday. Oscar Wamalwa grabbed a last-gasp equaliser in the fourth minute of added time, just seconds before the referee blew the whistle for full time. Posta had taken the lead in the 55th minute through Brian Marita's solo effort. “I'm entirely impressed by the fighting spirit we displayed in the match and I'm glad we managed to collect a point,” said Ocholla. As Ocholla celebrated nudging aside the scare, his opposite number Stanley Okumbi said he was disappointed his charges squandered a glorious opportunity to seal maximum points. “We played well, had better possession and I believe we should have posted a better outcome in the fixture,” said a visibly disappointed Okumbi. Following the outcome, Posta have moved to 5th on the log with 22 points while Ulinzi Stars are now 12th with 16 points.
