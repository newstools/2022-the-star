President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday said that Kenya is ready to establish a diplomatic mission in Hungary's capital, Budapest. Speaking after bilateral talks with visiting Hungarian President János Áder, Uhuru said the Embassy would be established at the earliest opportunity to increase presence in Europe. "It is our desire to have a greater presence in Central and Eastern Europe, and I'm glad to announce today that Kenya is ready to establish a diplomatic mission in Budapest at the earliest opportunity," he said at State House in Nairobi. The President added that Kenya is particularly keen on creating more collaborations between its vibrant private sector and their Hungarian counterparts as an avenue of fully exploiting the immense potential for trade and investment that exists between the two countries. Uhuru noted that collaborations between the two countries are built on trade, investment and development. "... and it is within this progressive framework that Kenya and Hungary look forward to growing our trade and investment as we recover from the disruptions occasioned by Covid-19." Hungary President János Áder arrived in Kenya on Sunday for a four-day State visit. Áder was welcomed by the President and accorded a 21-gun salute at the State House on Monday. The Hungarian President was accompanied by First Lady Anita Herczegh. President Áder will also visit Ghana, where he will view a sewage treatment plant in Kumasi that employs Hungarian technology.
