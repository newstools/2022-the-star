Ulinzi Starlets' utility player Diana Shakava has promised to score more goals after opening her account over the weekend in their 6-0 trashing of Bunyore Starlets. The maverick captain, who has been utilised as a right back, stepped up to score a double while playing as a forward in the absence of Lucy Mukhwana who is out for the next three months due to work commitments. The soldiers finally arrested their poor run following a 2-0 loss to Vihiga Queens and a barren draw with Wadadia, prompting coach Joseph Mwanza to tinker with his squad. "It was nice to be back among the scorers because it's been a while since I found the back of the net. The entire team made it possible but scoring for me meant a lot. There are a lot of goals coming but there's more to my game than scoring," Shakava bullishly remarked. "Lucy Mukhwana is not around. She's in class and career progression is always given a priority. I had to go back to striking having played there a couple of times. I'll play anywhere provided the coach instructs me." She added: "We have to shoulder the burden. Siliya Rasoa, Gentrix Kuyudi, Lanolina Aoko and Jane Kyalo are all up to the task." Ulinzi have come under scrutiny lately following their slump. A change in approach by Mwanza could make the Super Cup and FKF Women's Cup champions a tough nut to crack like last season. Ulinzi were stubborn defensively  and scored for fun with Mukhwana and the retired Neddy Atieno tearing defences at will. "The first thing we agreed following our barren draw with Wadadia was not to concede. We have achieved that in two matches because the coach made it clear that defending was everybody's duty beginning with the strikers. We now have to show our ruthless edge in the final third." Ulinzi are fifth on the log with seven points and face Nakuru City Queens at the ASK Grounds on Saturday.
