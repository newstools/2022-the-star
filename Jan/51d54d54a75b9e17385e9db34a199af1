Ford Kenya party leader Moses Wetang'ula days ago declared that he will work with deputy president William Ruto ahead of the August 9, elections. The declaration was made on Sunday, January 23, when ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi launched his presidential bid. The DP was present at the function. His announcement sparked mixed reactions among leaders who were elected on his party's ticket. A section of them supported him in his declaration while others ditched the party in protest.
