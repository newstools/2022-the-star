A police officer was shot dead by suspected bandits who raided a police station in Samburu County. Constable Moses Mwambia was shot as he fetched water for a gang of bandits that had raided Lerata police post near Archer’s post on January 2. This is the latest incident to affect the area in a series that have displaced many locals amid calls for action to tame the trend. Police said the gang had gone to the station and asked for drinking water and as the officer went for the same at a nearby tank, he was shot from behind dying on the spot. The bandits escaped from the scene after the 5 pm incident. The motive is yet to be known. On Christmas Day, another officer was shot dead in the Samburu area in another banditry attack. The attackers torched several manyattas and stole livestock left behind by villagers who had fleed the area. Police said several animals were stolen in the incident on the eve of Christmas Day in Pura village. The deceased was part of a team that was pursuing the stolen animals when he was hit. The gang had earlier on also shot and killed a 60-year-old man in a suspected retaliation mission. They escaped with the animals as police pursued them amid exchange of fire. Samburu police commander Thomas Ngewa also said that the officer in charge of the Maralal police station was injured in the exchange of fire that broke out. He discouraged cases of retaliation and urged local communities to respect life and property. The area is among those facing persistent attacks by bandits targeting animals and on retaliation missions. Authorities have mobilized resources to address the menace in vain. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said the area is among those that have been mapped for special attention in the coming days. The other areas include Marsabit, Turkana and Baringo where such incidents happen.
