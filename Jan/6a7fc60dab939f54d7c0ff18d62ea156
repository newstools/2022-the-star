Socialite Huddah Monroe is back in the country. Huddah spent two years running errands in Dubai. Sharing videos of firework displays from an apartment in Nairobi, the socialite said she is grateful to be in Kenya. "So loud congrats y'all," Huddah said about fireworks in the horizon. "New vybz 1/1/22," read another caption. "I couldn’t choose a better view for my first day of 2022." Huddah also talked about some weed she had left behind. "Left this weed here two years ago, lol! And they never touched it cleaning my place. Love my family." The socialite also shared some resolutions. "If I go ghost, don't take it personal, I am probably doing something to better myself. Like, I really wanna see friends but I have a lot on my plate."
