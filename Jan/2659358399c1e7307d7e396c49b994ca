A man, his wife and their child on Monday died after a trailer that was ferrying sugarcane fell on them. Victor Onjwayo, his wife Caroline Akoth and their six-year-old son were travelling on a motorbike from Rodi Kopany market when the accident occurred. The 8pm accident occurred at Wiobiero village near Rodi Kopany market in Homa Bay Town constituency. Residents led by Daniel Ogeda said the three were trapped under a heap of sugar cane. “We could not remove the cane faster with our bare hands. Unfortunately, we found them dead when we reached them,” Ogada said. Kalanya Kanyango senior assistant chief Fredrick Onyango said on Tuesday the trailer overturned after veering off the road to allow buses to overtake. The driver lost control of the trailer and it fell on Onjwayo and his family. Onyango said the bodies were pulled out after the management at Sukari Industries brought in a crane to lift the trailer. He said the trailer fell because of the weight of load it had. “The road should be expanded because it is too narrow to allow passage of two large vehicles at the same time,” Onyango said. The bodies were taken to Homa Bay County Referral Hospital mortuary. Homa Bay subcounty police commander Sammy Kosgey said security agencies are investigating the incident. He said they are looking for the driver and his conductor who escaped after the accident. “Let trailers stop travelling at night because some of them do not have headlights,” Kosgey said.
