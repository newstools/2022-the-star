The new alliance between Deputy President William Ruto and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has energised UDA backers in Rift Valley who call it a game changer. Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago welcomed the new unity between the two leaders, urging more Kenyans to join the DP. "It's clear we have a winning team that will liberate this country from its many challenges," he said. Mandago said the new alliance had indeed caused a political tremor in the county, signalling that change was on the way. The excitement is heightening as UDA and ANC parties hold their first joint rally in Nakuru on Wednesday. UDA coordinators led by Paul Kiprop said the alliance was best placed to win the August 9 polls because many more Kenyans will join the new alliance. "That was just the start because we will have a movement whose political force will be unstoppable," Kiprop said. MPs Daniel Rono of Keiyo South and Caleb Kositany of Soy said Kenyans were tired of bad leadership and a collapsing economy, hence their strong will to change leadership. "It is a break from the past where a few people want to use power to benefit themselves while Kenyans languish in poverty," Kositany said. They spoke as ODM leader Raila Odinga's allies said he would get backing in the region considered a UDA stronghold. "Baba has strong backing in this region and the numbers will tell at the end of the polls," MCA for Langas Francis Muya said. MCA for Kiplombe Ramadan Ali and ODM official Kipkorir Menjo agreed. Supporters of the Azimo la Umoja movement on Saturday held a well-attended rally at Huruma grounds in Eldoret where they pledged to campaign for Raila to change the region. Key leaders backing Raila, led by Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos, have planned to campaign vigorously for Azimio. But UDA patron in Uasin Gishu James Wainaina said the party had attracted wide support because DP Ruto always addressed issues affecting the common person. (Edited by V. Graham)
