Ruth Nabwire’s 55th-minute strike was all that Kayole Starlets needed to floor a hard-fighting Zetech Sparks at Ruaraka grounds. This was Kayole’s first win of the season having lost to both Thika Queens and Gaspo. Kayole started the match as underdogs having not won against Sparks in the past six encounters. Kayole coach Joshua Sakwa lauded the fighting spirit of his players despite the numerous problems that bedeviled the team in pre-season. “This is the best performance I have seen from the team this season. We had prepared well and the outcome isn’t surprising,” he noted. He added: “We lost 14 players in the off-season when our sponsor withdrew and this is a totally new team. Despite the win, there’s still room for improvement. This is not the time to celebrate because we have a match against Kangemi Ladies and we want to take a match at a time and build momentum going forward.” Sparks team manager Kevin Kamau admitted that their wastefulness in front of goal had proved costly but promised to put their act together ahead of the crunch tie against Gaspo at Cambridge grounds. “Our attack lost many chances and our opponents scored barely from nothing. We dominated the entire game but their backline stood firm. We are going to work on our finishing.” Elsewhere, Bunyore Starlets beat Nakuru Queens at Mumboha grounds. Captain Susan Maldar scored twice for the winners while Melon Mulindi converted a penalty for Nakuru.  “We have promised ourselves that no team will walk out of Mumboha grounds with a point and I am happy we have so far achieved that,” said Bunyore coach Daniel Arunga. At Mumias Complex, Vihiga Queens beat Falcons of Trans Nzoia 3-0.
