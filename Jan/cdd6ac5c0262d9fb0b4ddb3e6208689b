A top Wiper Party official has asked the three Ukambani governors to back party boss Kalonzo Musyoka. Wiper Party vice-chairman Victor Swanya Ogeto said on Thursday that it would be in the best interest of the community if the county bosses rally behind Kalonzo. "A strong Kalonzo would be even better for the governors because he will become a stronger negotiator," Swanya said. On Wednesday, governors Alfred Mutua (Machakos), Kivutha Kibwana (Makueni) and Charity Ngilu of Kitui laughed off Kalonzo's influence in the region. The leaders who spoke after a meeting in Machakos also questioned Kalonzo's grip of the Ukambani region, saying he must work with all other leaders if he must have any impact nationally. The three county bosses have declared their support for ODM boss Raila Odinga. But on Thursday, Swanya dismissed the governors' proposition, saying they are sabotaging the interests of the Ukambani community. "It is true and a fact that without Kalonzo, Mutua and Kibwana would have not been re-elected. Ngilu won her first term by aligning herself to Kalonzo," Swanya said. "These governors must stop political hypocrisy and instead support Kalonzo so that the region can have strong bargaining power," he added. Ukambani, which has been under Kalonzo’s control for decades, has lately become a battleground. Orange Democratic Movement party leader Raila Odinga and Deputy President William Ruto (United Democratic Alliance) are also exploring ways to take the grip of the region. But Kalonzo is fighting back and has invited Ukambani leaders for a meeting on Saturday at his Yatta home.
