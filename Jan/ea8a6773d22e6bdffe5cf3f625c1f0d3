The exit of Alex Kosgey from the Emgwen parliamentary seat in Nandi has attracted 10 aspirants. Kosgey will go for the Senate seat currently held by Samson Cherargei. Emgwen, with 65,000 registered voters and the home of international athletes, has attracted two international athletes, Wilfred Bungei and Janeth Jepkosgei. The two come from Kabirsang village, one of Alex Kosgey strongholds in Emgwen and home to former and current runners focusing on leadership. Harry Kipruto, a businessman in Kapsabet, has joined the race to replace Koskey. He boasts of having the support of 70 per cent of youths. Kipruto, 34, said being a town dweller, he understood the difficulties youth faced in trying to seek opportunities. Others eyeing the MP seat are Nandi Woman Representative Teclah Tum, former Woman Representative Ziporah Kering, Nandi Kuppet executive secretary Paul Rotich, Joel Malel-former chairman of the former Nandi county council. Others are Meshack Kimutai, the chairman of the national youth congress among many others. Wilfred Bungei, the Beijing Olympic 800M gold medalist, is making his second attempt at politics. He lost the 2017 general election to Kosgey in the Jubilee primaries. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
