Nairobi Lands executive Charles Kerich has joined the growing list of civil servants seeking elective seats in the August general election. Kerich, who has announced his intention to vie for the Bomet Central MP seat, said he will resign in February as stipulated by the IEBC for civil servants eyeing political jobs. He is a former chairman of the Media Council of Kenya and editor-in-chief at the Star newspaper. Kerich will battle it out with Richard Kilel, Bomet Woman Representative Joyce Korir, Agnes Ruto, Patrick Bii and David Cheruiyot. Kilel and Bii contested in 2017 but lost to incumbent MP Ronald Tonui. Tonui has opted out of the race in what he described as creating a chance for other leaders to show what they have. “After the last election I made up my mind that I will be a two-term MP so that I can leave room for other leaders to show what they have for our people,” Tonui said. He said he has accomplished what he had promised the electorate, adding that he would return to politics in the future. Tonui was last seen at a public rally during Deputy President William Ruto’s event in Silibwet, Bomet, mid-last year. He has kept off public events and campaigns. Kilel is a senior manager at the Kenya Rural Roads Authority. He said he will resign to concentrate on his campaigns. The race has proven to be one of the most competitive in the county. In one of his meetings in Silibwet Township, Kerich said if elected he would create a market for farmers' produce, mainly tea and milk. He will also invest in roads and education. “There are many opportunities, both within government and NGOs that I, in collaboration with Bomet people, can exploit to help farmers and youths better their lives,” he said. Kerich said Bomet Central is an agricultural hub and there is a need to venture into dairy farming as an alternative to tea farming. Edited by A.N
