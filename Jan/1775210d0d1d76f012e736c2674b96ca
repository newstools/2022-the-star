South African investigators have flagged COVID-19 contracts worth around 2.1 billion rand ($137.12 million) for possible corruption and fraud, a report into corruption linked to the pandemic showed on Tuesday.

In a statement accompanying the SIU's final report on Tuesday, Ramaphosa's office said: "It is unacceptable that so many contracts associated with saving lives and protecting livelihoods were irregular, unlawful or fraudulent." The 2.1 billion rand of contracts under suspicion have been enrolled in the Special Tribunal, which is mandated to recover public funds lost through corruption, fraud and illicit money flows, the more than 700-page report said. The SIU referred 224 officials in government departments or entities for disciplinary action after finding 2,803 contracts were irregular. It identified some of those facing accusations and estimated that the value of cash and assets to be recovered was around 552 million rand.
