The United Democratic Alliance party has called on the public to ignore reports detailing how the party plans to share positions of power if it forms the next government in August. In a statement, UDA Secretary-General Veronica Maina said the reports should be treated as mere speculation by the media. She insisted that the cooperation between UDA, ANC and Ford Kenya is only aimed at bringing Kenyans together, driving the country towards economic prosperity and not intended at sharing any positions of power. “The details of the cooperation between UDA, ANC and Ford Kenya and any other political party if at all, will be formally unveiled by the Principals at an appropriate time,” Maina said. “In the meantime, I wish to urge the public and the members and supporters of the respective political parties involved to ignore such misrepresentation and treat it with the contempt it deserves.” UDA was responding to a report by The Standard newspaper, which revealed how the Kenya Kwanza coalition plans to share power if they form a government on August 9. In the plan, Ruto would be allowed to pick a Deputy President of his choice and the deputy governor for Nairobi, as well as well as senator and woman representative for the city county. Mudavadi would be appointed Chief Minister and given the ministries of Finance and Devolution plus an additional ministry. He will also get other government appointments in addition to producing governor candidate for Nairobi, Kakamega and Bungoma. Wetangula will on his part will be allocated two cabinet slots with other government appointments. He will also field candidates in Bungoma and Trans Nzoia counties.
