A Garissa court on Monday allowed police to hold for another seven days a man suspected to be behind the poisoning of nominated MCA Queen Teresia. Bernard Katana and Josphine Mbula, a house help, are accused of attempted murder. The two allegedly mixed the MCA's prescribed syrup with a liquid substance suspected to be poison on January 11. The prosecution led by Victor Owuor urged the court to detain the suspect for seven days to allow the investigations to be completed. Owuor added that Katana is a flight risk and cannot be granted bail. The police are still pursuing a third suspect. Garissa resident magistrate Cosmas Maundu granted the request and ordered that the suspect be detained at Madogo police station. The prosecution told the court that the police intend to retrieve the suspect’s communication data from Safaricom, in order to establish if he was at the crime scene or if he colluded with other suspects to commit the offence. “The recovered substances have been forwarded to government chemist in Nairobi for analysis and the results have not been received,” a police affidavit by corporal Samson Ogembo read. Katana termed his arrest and prosecution as a "political witch-hunt" adding that it could be linked to him being the leader of the Kamba community in Garissa. The suspect claimed that his life was in danger because they live in the same locality with the complainant. He further denied knowing Mbula, the help. The police intend to merge Mbula and Katana's case when the case comes up for mention on February 2. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
