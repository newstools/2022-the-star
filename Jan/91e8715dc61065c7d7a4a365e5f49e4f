Deputy president William Ruto has pledged to work ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi in the run up to the general elections. Ruto further said will work with Ford Kenya and like minded parties keen on uniting Kenyans. "We will work with ANC, Ford Kenya and all other parties that want to walk this journey of bringing Kenyans together," Ruto said. "We are going to raise the bar and standards of leadership so that deceit and conman ship doesn't become part of the equation of leadership in Kenya. Kenya must belong to everyone and not a preserve of a few in power." Ruto said he has had discussions with Mudavadi that Kenya is bigger than the two of them. "The only two candidates who have identified economy as the place to begin from is ANC and UDA. The coming together of the two will have a chance to deal with the challenges facing our nation. Hustlers need uchumi bora which must start at the bottom, "he said. The DP said the two will have to make sacrifices so that they can be able to drive the nation to the next level. He said his journey with Mudavadi to unite the country officially started at Bomas of Kenya. "Next stop will be in Nakuru on Wednesday, then Western on Friday and then on Saturday we will be in Central" he added.
