Deputy President William Ruto's son Nick Ruto today (Saturday) married his long term lover Evelyn Chemtai in a traditional ceremony commonly referred to as koito in the Kalenjin community. Nick is the firstborn son of DP Ruto. He is a lawyer by profession. Chemtai is the daughter of Mr and Mrs David Baron from Laikipia county. The man of the hour Nick donned a customized white kaunda suit decorated with a kitenge fabric on the left side of the shoulders and blended with a white panama hat. Groomsmen sparkled in cut-to-fit blue kaunda suits, brown panama hats and matching brown shoes. The exquisite ceremony was held at Windy Ridge Karen. The ceremony brought together family members and friends including DP Ruto's close political leaders. Governors Jackson Mandago from Ruto's Uasin Gishu rural county and Stephen Sang of Nandi were present. Senators Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) and Aaaron Cheruiyot (Kericho) also graced the event. National Assembly members included Alice Wahome (Kandara), Caleb Kositany (Soy), Gladys Boss Shollei (Uasin Gishu) among others. The ceremony comes nearly a year after the DP's daughter June Ruto got married to a Nigerian lover Alexander Ezenagu at Karen, Nairobi.
