Former assistant commissioner general of Prisons Patrick Mwenda is dead. Mwenda suffered a head surgery after falling in his bathroom. He died at a private hospital in Mombasa two days after being admitted. Mwenda, who was in charge of Naivasha prison before retiring, was instrumental in introducing reforms in the facility, including an education programme that now benefits more than 2,000 inmates. His friend Francis Mwangi said he underwent a head surgery to remove a clot. “He was in perfect health in his Mombasa home when he fell and suffered a head injury. He unfortunately died a couple of days after the operation,” Mwangi said. “His wish was that he be cremated and we are working on that before holding a memorial mass at his home town in Embu.” Meanwhile, one person died on the spot and two others seriously injured on Monday night after a road accident along Naivasha-Mai Mahiu road. The car they were travelling in rammed into an oncoming trailer near Chechnia centre. The injured were admitted to Naivasha Subcounty Hospital. Naivasha police boss Samuel Waweru said the car was heading to Mai Mahiu when it rammed into the trailer. Occupants of the trailer escaped with minor injuries. “Our officers arrived in time and thwarted efforts to steal transit goods from the trailer but unfortunately we lost one person to the accident,” he said.
