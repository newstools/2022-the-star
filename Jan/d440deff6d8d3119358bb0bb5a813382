For the first time in many years, Deputy President William Ruto's wife Rachel Ruto on Thursday addressed a rally-like gathering in Nakuru county. Rachel who had pitched a tent in Kuresoi south meeting women groups was accompanied by Nakuru county woman rep Lisa Chelule and Kuresoi south MP Joseph Tanui. The images shared on her handled showed Rachel interacting with residents from the sunroof of a vehicle. "Glad to interact with residents and women at Keringet, Nakuru county accompanied by Hon. Lisa Chelule (Nakuru County) and Hon. Joseph Tanui (Kuresoi South). Acknowledged greetings from residents of Keringet, Kuresoi South, Nakuru County," she tweeted. The DP's wife ostensibly stopped to not only greet residents but also to drum up support of her husband who is eyeing the presidency in the August 9, polls. Ruto, in several interviews, has lauded his wife for being the reason behind his success. He once said that Rachel is instrumental in guiding their family when he is away for his engagements and even praying for his success.
