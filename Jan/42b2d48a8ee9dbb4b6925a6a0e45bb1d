The Kenya men and women's national hockey teams are yet to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations championships that begin in Ghana on Monday. Announcing the final squads on Thursday, Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) president Nashon Randiek said they were unsure when the Kenyan brigade would travel to Accra even as they continue to seek support from the government. "I don't know when we will depart for Ghana. Maybe tomorrow (Friday) we will have gotten a solution but I can't assure you. We are discussing with the Ministry and the sooner we iron out the matter the better," Randiek told a press conference at the City Park Stadium. One of the players who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal said both camps have been sent into panic as communication remains vague. "We have not received any communication up to now yet the competition begins on Monday," the player said. An aborted trip will be a big blow to the junior players who are keen to make a mark on the international stage. 20 youngsters in both the men and women's categories were drafted for duty. The men are in pool 'A' alongside Namibia and South Africa. They are set to play Namibia on January 18 before taking on Champions South Africa the following day. Pool B has Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria and neighbours Uganda. The ladies are in pool 'B' that has Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia. The Kenya Queens take on Zambia on Monday, play Ghana on January 18 before facing off Nigeria a day later. Pool 'A' has South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Uganda.
