Speaker of the National Assembly, Justin Muturi, has accused Deputy President William Ruto of stealing the phrase 'Kenya Kwanza'. Speaking on Sunday in Nyamira county, Muturi said he had a billboard on Thika road three months ago and the signature phrase he used was 'Kenya Kwanza'. He said he will change his phrase to 'Wakenya Mbele' hoping that it will not be stolen. "If you happened to use Thika road 3 months ago, you saw my billboard with a signature phrase 'Kenya Kwanza'. Hii Kenya watu wamekuwa waporaji wanapora hadi signature phrase. Sasa nimeamua Wakenya mbele. Hii nayo msiniibie," he said. Muturi also stated that Kenyans have a tendency of casting votes to those who have been in government for so long. "Let us not be blinded by big names. Elect leaders based on their track record not fame," he said. Muturi was in Nyamira county accompanied by Members of Parliament to lay to rest Borabu MP Ben Momanyi's brother Benson Nyasimi Momanyi "I wish to send my heartfelt condolence to the family and friends. May you find comfort and peace. Like a bird singing in the rain, let grateful memories survive in a time of sorrow," Muturi said. Muturi also assured Kenyans that he has their interest in heart and that he will first "concentrate on sectors that are close to our people and add meaning to our lives like health and education." "We need a healthy country that's why I will focus on the health sector. Our hospitals will be stocked with medicine and adequate health workers. "On education sector, I'll push for a proper audit on how many teachers we need in our public schools. We need quality public education," Muturi said.
