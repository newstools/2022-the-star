Nominated MP David Sankok wants ODM party leader Raila Odinga barred from vying for the presidency, claiming he has committed treason twice. Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Sankok said he has a battery of lawyers ready to go to court over the treason claims. "Raila committed treason in 1982 and also swore himself in 2017. Those who swore him were punished, yet Raila has not been punished," he said. "Is it because of the handshake? Does the handshake wash all your sins?" he posed. During the 2017 mock swearing-in, the then Attorney General Githu Muigai said the punishment for committing treason is death. "The swearing-in of any person not declared by IEBC, and who did not win the election, is unacceptable," he said. Githu further noted that if an inauguration is not by the Chief Justice it is null, void and illegal. But two years down the line, a court said that Raila's swearing-in was not illegal. Chief Magistrate Stephen Mbungi ruled that the oath taken after the disputed 2017 presidential election was not unlawful and that he would have only been held responsible if he used his swearing-in to commit a crime.
