Deputy President William Ruto has promised to improve the living conditions of people living in slum areas. The DP spoke on Wednesday in the Eastleigh area in Kamukunji constituency, Nairobi County, where he continued with his campaigns for the August 9, polls. The DP said that if he is elected president, his government will build 100,000 new housing units in Nairobi that will accommodate people living in deplorable conditions in the slum areas. “We will employ 400,000 youths to take part in the construction of the new units as we plan to move the people of Nairobi from the slums to the modern houses which will have enough water and a proper sewage system.” At the same time, the DP urged Kamukunji residents to rally behind his bid saying he understands the language of ordinary citizens and the small traders. “We are going to build 20 new markets in Nairobi. We are going to make laws that will protect your businesses…we are going to avail Sh5 billion for the government of Nairobi, for the hustlers to do their business,” Ruto said. The DP noted that the markets will ensure Nairobians are well covered from harsh sunshine and heavy rains that have become an impediment to their businesses. Ruto also reiterated that he will not yield to threats and intimidations targeting him. He also said that Kenyans are able to choose the type of leaders they want and that no one will impose any leader on them. “They are attempting to endorse certain people who will be elected as the leader of our country. One who will later amend the constitution to have a president who is a dictator.” He also said that the residents will be issued with the title deeds. -Edited by B. Marita
