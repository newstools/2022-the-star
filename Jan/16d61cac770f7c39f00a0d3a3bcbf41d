Politician and businessman Geoffrey Asanyo has vowed to topple long-serving Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi. Asanyo, a former powerful Nakuru Kanu branch chairman during the Moi era, joins an increasing number of aspirants in the race to unseat Angwenyi who is serving his fifth term. Angwenyi, 77, has declared that he will defend his seat. He is the longest-serving MP in the National Assembly. Speaking in Kisii town on Wednesday, Asanyo said: “Angwenyi is my friend but it’s time for him to go home. He has done his best for the years he has served us and it’s time for fresh blood.” Asanyo, a close ally of ODM leader Raila Odinga, said despite Angwenyi’s long reign, the constituency still lags behind in development. “I decided to enter the race because the people of Kitutu Chache North are suffering. "Roads and school infrastructure are in a pathetic state. People are not getting bursaries in the constituency while the levels of education are low,” Asanyo added. The businessman condemned the culture of handouts which he blamed on high levels of poverty. Others in the race are former Kisumu finance chief officer Erick Angwenyi Orang’i who will make his debut in politics, ODM’s James Atandi, UDA’s Ogamba Migosi and Japheth Nyakundi. Ogamba finished second in the last election. He has since ditched ODM and joined William Ruto’s UDA. “A lot happened in the last election but those shenanigans will not be repeated this time. "We were intimidated and harassed during campaigns and on polling day. Any rigging plots will be countered this time round,” Migosi said. (Edited by Bilha Makokha)
