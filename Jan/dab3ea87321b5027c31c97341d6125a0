Kiss FM's Jalang'o will still be seeing his fans in the entertainment scene even after he is elected Lang'ata MP. Speaking in an exclusive interview with Kiss FM, Jalang'o said he is not going to leave entertainment because it's something he loves. "I wish I would still come back and do my radio show and run to Parliament because being a leader shouldn't change what you do," he said. "I still love hosting events. Emceeing, why should I stop? This is just a chance to do something different, who said men can't multi-task? I'm going to be the first radio presenter who's also an MP who hosts gigs and still delivers the promises out there." Jalas also said his wife Amina Chao is not ready to be an MP's wife. "She's seen people have started visiting us, we are having new friends, late nights and all, but she supports me and she has accepted that this is the direction I want to take. She said, 'You know what? Why not, let's do this!'" Asked if his brand name was what inspired him to run for a parliamentary seat, Jalas said his main goal is to make a difference for the people of Lang'ata. The Kiss FM breakfast host doubles up as a corporate MC and an events host. He also owns and runs Jalang'o TV.
