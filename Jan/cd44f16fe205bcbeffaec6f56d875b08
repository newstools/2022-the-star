The High Court will on Wednesday issue new hearing dates to parties involved in the trial of a police officer charged with the murder of 13-year-old boy, Yassin Moyo, in Shauri Moyo in 2020. The case had been scheduled for hearing on Monday through to Wednesday but failed to proceed owing to the absence of the defence counsel Danstan Omari. The court heard that Omari was held up in another murder case in Mombasa involving MP Aisha Jumwa. At the same time, the International Justice Mission said it is unfortunate that the murder trial is yet to take off more than a year since the shooting occurred. Advocate Janice Muchemi, acting for the victim, asked the court to grant them nearer hearing dates and out of consideration that one of the witness is a Form 4 candidate. The prosecution was ready with four witnesses. In the case, Duncan Ndiema was charged before Justice Luka Kimaru on June 23 last year with the murder of Yassin. He denied the charges. He was released on a Sh1 million cash bail with a condition he does not interfere with the witnesses lined up to testify against him. At the time of the incident and Ndiema’s subsequent arrest, the tension in the community was high with a lot of animosity towards the police. Ndiema is said to have been in uniform when he committed the crime. He also had an Israeli pistol loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition.    -Edited by SKanyara
