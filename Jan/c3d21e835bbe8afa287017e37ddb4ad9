Nabangala Nyongesa's second-half strike was all that Nakuru City Queens needed to beat Kisumu All Starlets in a hotly contested Kenya Women's Premier League match at ASK Showground Nakuru on Sunday. The win has salvaged the Benard Esitoko-tutored side from the relegation zone. They target maximum points when they travel to face Kayole Starlets in Nairobi next weekend. "The players fought hard for the three points and their patience paid off in the second half," Esitoko said. "The result has enabled us to get out of the danger zone and the target is to move up the table in the subsequent matches starting with Kayole." Elsewhere, Ulinzi Starlets made light work of Trans-Nzoia Falcons, thumping the Kitale-based side 5-0 at Ruaraka. Lanoline Aoko, Siliya Rasoa, Sheril Angachi and Jentrix Khuyudi  scored a goal each. Persistent pressure from Ulinzi led the Justine Okiring-coached Falcons to concede an own goal. The win enabled Ulinzi to dislodge the Falcons from the third spot with 14 points. The Falcons dropped to fifth while Thika secured fourth place following their latest victory.
