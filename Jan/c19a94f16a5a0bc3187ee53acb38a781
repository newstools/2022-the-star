Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli has said the Sunday speech by ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi has zero effect on the labor movement. "I want to assure Kenyans that Mudavadi's speech has no effect on Kenya's labour movement, " Atwoli said. On Sunday, during the unveiling of ANC's presidential candidate at Bomas of Kenya, Mudavadi took a swipe at Atwoli, saying the labor sector is in turmoil. His sentiments left the crowd roaring as they chanted "Atwoli must go". "Clueless and clowning self-serving leadership under the labour sector," Mudavadi said. Mudavadi went ahead to question Atwoli's wealth. "It is dominated by a few people who properly boast and display their trappings of massive opulence," he said. Atwoli said Mudavadi is in the business of buying down his small house to cause total destruction to both his supporters and opponents. "This explains why he was dragging my name and that of Cotu in his speech that was written by our arch-nemesis," he said.
