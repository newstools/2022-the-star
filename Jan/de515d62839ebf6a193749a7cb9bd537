 Over 50 juniors and 52 corporate golfers have confirmed participation in the Safaricom Golf Tour this weekend at Nanyuki Sports Club in Laikipia. The two-day tournament follows the telcos' launch of its golf tour series last weekend at Golf Park, Nairobi, with the aim of nurturing and growing talent across the country. The amateur field will take part in the 18-hole tournament, which will also be preceded by community engagement at Kano grounds. “Nanyuki’s serenity offers a great environment for golf. So, here players will be able to set the tone for the standards of skills and sportsmanship that we expect in this year’s series from the lineup of sportsmen and women as well as young players,” said Peter Ndegwa, CEO Safaricom. Safaricom has invested Sh100 million for the inaugural edition of the tour which will be played at various clubs across the country. “Our objective for this golf tour is to make golf accessible to people. Our regional tours will help in transforming lives within the sport and breaking down the barriers that have been built around it, which have made it to be seen as a non–inclusive sport,” said Ndegwa. The Saturday tours will mostly feature corporates participating in the tournament with junior tournaments being held on Sundays and caddies on Mondays.  After Nanyuki, the tournament proceeds to Limuru before heading to Muthaiga.
