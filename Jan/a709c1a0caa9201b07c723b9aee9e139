We believe more parties will join One Kenya Alliance (OKA) to form a formidable alliance. Ideally, ODM and Jubilee should join OKA now that the forces that were a hindrance and opposed the idea have chickened out. I am sure ODM, more than ever, note that they need to join OKA to grant a one run. The issue of offices and nominations is a subject of discussions and negotiations. We must be guided by scientific data and critical analysis where some factors will inform the best decisions that will grant the objects of the alliance's manifestos and regional balance. The amended political parties act has opened serious challenges on candidate nominations both for alliances and individual parties, particularly, the issue of the mechanism of party member registration and authenticating records of party members with the Registrar of Political Parties. The resources required and time before the next election to carry out the exercise have found most parties unprepared and may affect small parties. Wiper, as a party, we have elaborate regulations and procedures under the election board led by Madam Agathe Soletei. However, we will consider new avenues allowed by the Political Parties Act where applicable. The alliance's parties primarily will focus on the presidential candidate and how the government will be formed, notwithstanding where joint nominations are beneficial to the coalition must be considered as much as zoning of strongholds regions will prioritise. Victor Swanya is the Wiper Party vice-chairman.
