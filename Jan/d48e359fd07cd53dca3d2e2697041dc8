Nairobi governor Anne Kananu and ODM leader Raila Odinga on Tuesday presided over the launch of mass voter registration in Nairobi. The event was held at Nairobi County Hall. During the event, Raila urged Kenyans to register as voters so that they get to choose their leaders later this year. "Be an example to your friends, family, and anyone around you, walk the talk by choosing to register today at a registration centre near you," Raila said. The event was attended by hundreds of city residents. Governor Kananu and Raila flagged off a caravan to officially launch the mass registration exercise.
