Onion rings are usually served as appetizers or side dishes for meals. However, you can prepare them as a snack to munch on as you binge on your favourite series, they're quite filling if you ask me. The first record of onion rings dates all the way to 1469 when the king of France "Louis XI" requested that his servants invent a new food snack. Onion rings are crispy, slightly sweet and savoury. Besides being a side dish sometimes it's added to burgers or served on top of baked meat dishes to give the meal a pop of colour. Ingredients Method Cut the onions into large slices and separate the rings. Put them in some ice water with a bit of salt and let them soak for about 30 minutes to 1 hour Take 2 cups of the corn puffs and crush them, in a grinder, into powder. In a large bowl mix the breadcrumbs and spices in a bowl, add the corn puffs mix evenly then set aside. In another bowl, mix the milk, flour and egg together until smooth and a well combined thick paste is formed. Pour the water with the onion rings and dry the onions with paper towels Dust them with 2 tablespoons of flour. Take an onion ring and dip it in the flour mixture, remove it with a fork till the excess flour paste is not dripping. Dredge it in the breadcrumb and corn puff powder mixture till well incorporated and set aside on a tray, sprinkled with more bread crumbs and corn puff powder mixture. Do the last two steps with the rest of the onions. Heat oil in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Dip the onion rings in the oil and let them cook for 3 minutes till crispy and golden brown. Set them on a tray laid with paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve with your preferred choice of dip or sauce and enjoy
