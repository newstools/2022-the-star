Mukuyu town is set for an economic development boost once the 3.5km Mukuyu-Kabwe-Sewerage road in Murang'a county is complete. The Sh247.8 million project is being implemented by Kenya Urban Roads Authority. Kenya Urban Roads Authority director general Silas Kinoti said in a statement that the project is 40 per cent complete and is expected to be completed by May this year. “The project scope includes the construction of the carriageway, improvement of walkways and drains and installation of road safety amenities,” he said. The project will improve the lives of residents as well as raise the value of property in Mukuyu and Kabwe. The tarmacking of the road will also ease transport of goods to and from the market. Residents have often complained over the dilapidated state of roads around the town. Car owners and motorcyclists said they spend a lot of money repairing their vehicles and motorbikes due to the sorry state of the roads. Kura has encountered several challenges while implementing the project. They include relocation of services and encroachment of the corridor. However, consultations with the local administration have assisted the authority to engage the persons affected by the project to clear the corridor.
