DP William Ruto should desist from insulting leaders, Kitui governor Charity Ngilu has said. Ngilu was referring to Ruto's remarks that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka has lost his hair for supporting ODM party leader Raila Odinga. "Ruto should desist from insulting leaders and the regions those leaders come from," Ngilu said. Via Facebook on Saturday, Ngilu said they will not allow Ruto to come to Ukambani and insult their honest leader. "...just like he did in Meru with Governor Kiraitu Murungi while we watch. It just won’t happen again," she said. "let him look at himself, the age difference between them should make him understand that he should not be insulting Kalonzo who has been in leadership for a long time." Ngilu said the difference between the two leaders is that Kalonzo is honest and the other person is not. "Kalonzo is very reliable and has worked hard to bring peace. if you compare him and Ruto, they are like day and night. Kalonzo is tried and tested. It's not a name you can play with. You cant come to Ukambani and talk ill of the person of Kalonzo," she said. Last week, Ruto took a swipe at Kalonzo. "Mimi sina shida na mtu yeyote, nilisaida Raila hadi akawa Prime Minister lakini ilifika wakati nikagundua hapendi Mungu nikachoka nikamwachia Kalonzo," he said. Loosely translates to: (I have no problem with anyone, I helped Raila when he was the Prime minister but it reached a point where I realised he does not love God, I got tired then surrendered to Kalonzo). "Kalonzo alimsukuma hadi siku hizi nywele yake imekwisha. Ukipata mtu analalamika juu ya Kanisa, jua kuna shida," he said. Loosely translates to (Kalonzo pushed him until nowadays he has no hair. If you get someone complaining about church, there is a problem) Ruto claimed that Raila cannot be pushed to the presidency any further.
