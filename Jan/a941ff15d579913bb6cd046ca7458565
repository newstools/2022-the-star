As TikTok is trying to expand ways its consumers can completely engage with their app and increase its coverage, it’s been reported that the social media giant may be testing a new feature. The opt-in functionality will allow users to see those who viewed their profile. The features were uncovered by app researcher Kev Adriano (and shared by Matt Navarra), as screenshots, through a tweet. This feature will be similar to that of LinkedIn. There is no official word from TikTok as to whether the option will ever be released yet, but let us wait and see.
