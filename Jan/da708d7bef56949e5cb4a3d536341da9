Weekend means grill time with friends and family. Honey helps to add that crispy taste, and with pork, the flavour is magical Garlic works well with Italian seasoning or with any combination of basil, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme. Ingredients  Preparation Step 1 Preheat the grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Step 2 In a bowl, mix honey, soy sauce, garlic to make the glaze. Step 3 Burn the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill, then lightly brush the glaze onto each side of the pork chops as they cook. Step 4 Grill about 8 to 10 minutes per side until no longer pink in the centre. For extra flavour, marinating before grilling is advised. You can also bake in the oven at 350 for 40 minutes. Enjoy over Mukimo or fries with friends and family.
