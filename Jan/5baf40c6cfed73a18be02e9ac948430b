Socialite Huddah Monroe says Kenyan men are not her type. She recently complained about the poor servings available as far as Kenyan men go. "I need to take it all in! Maybe a d*ck would do, lol. But here the c*ck starvation is upon me cause nobody has been my type!!! And my manz in Europe snowballing." Earlier on, Huddah said she would never break up with a man she is dating simply because he cheated. On her Instastories, she said the only man she doesn’t entertain in her life is a broke and stingy man. "I will never break up with a man for cheating! Lol! Stingy, yes, I’m done. Day 1! Bye! Bye, was nice to meet you." Huddah spent two years running errands in Dubai.
