Atheists in Kenya society has threatened to take legal action against the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship of Africa(Pefa) church Saika branch in Kangundo road over noise pollution. The society in a letter by its president Harrison Mumia stated that the church has declined to heed constant appeals by neighbours to tone down on their "noisy worship" on Sunday and Friday services. "We have received numerous complaints that your church based in Saika, along Kagundo Road between Kwa Miti and Stage 18 is generating noise pollution on Sunday mornings and Friday nights during " KESHAS"," Mumia said in a letter. The letter was addressed to Bishop John Okinda and pastor Alex Wanyonyi. "The noise that emanates from your church is intolerable to a lot of residents living near the church." Mumia gave the church a 14-day ultimatum to address the matter or face legal action. "Please note that as a society, we plan to take legal action if the concerns of the complainants are not addressed conclusively," he added. According to Mumia, the complaints have not to be raised by atheists but Kenyans who have been concerned about the happenings in the church.
