At least seven CSs are eyeing gubernatorial seats. Quitting is required by election law, stating that public officers seeking to contest in the general election must quit at least six months to the polls. “All public officers intending to contest in the August 9 General Election must resign at least six months to the date of the General Election. That is the law that must be complied with,” IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati said. Section 43(3) of the Elections Act 2011 says the same.
