Viral upcoming rapper Kanambo, alias Quincher Mkanambo, has recorded her first single at Kaka Empire. Rapper King Kaka reached out to Kanambo to work with her at his Kaka Empire studios after videos of her freestyle rap went viral. Her first song is set to be released. "Ladies and Gentlemen, The fierce, she is @quinchermkanambo and she has just recorded her 1st single," Kaka Empire shared the news. Fellow rapper Maandy, however, warned her against trusting people in the music industry. "Word of advice to that girl freestyling. Do not accept to do a song or any mainstream act," she said. "Don't. You are brilliant on your own. Wanataka kukutumia." In a past interview, Kanambo shared how her love for rap started, saying she is ready to hit the studio.
