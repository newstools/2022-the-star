A man accused of extracting his ex-girlfriend’s three teeth after she allegedly dumped him has been arraigned at the Kibera court. Samuel Alfayo Akunda was arraigned before Kibera senior resident magistrate Renee Kitagwa where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. The charge sheet says the accused caused grievous harm to Emily Achieng on October 30, 2021, in Kibera within Nairobi County. According to the detectives, Achieng was walking to Alfayo house to collect her items after deciding to end their relationship but the walk ended up being a big nightmare as she lost her three teeth. She was attacked after she informed the accused person of her decision to pick her items after a short argument. Alfayo is said to have slapped her severally before he punched her and extracted her three upper teeth. Achieng reported the matter to the police and the accused person was arrested and arraigned in court. She was treated at a local hospital and issued a p3 form later. The accused person denied the charges after the magistrate informed him that he risks spending 10 years in jail if he pleads guilty. Kitagwa released Alfayo on Sh100, 000 bond and an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000 and directed that the matter be mentioned on February 9. The court also directed that the accused person be supplied with witness statements and documentary evidence that the prosecution intended to rely on during the entire case.
