Deputy president William Ruto is expected in Kajiado county as ODM party leader heads to Nakuru county. Ruto will attend a church service at the AIC Ilamsin Church in Kiserian, Kajiado at 10am. The Deputy President  has been selling his bottom up agenda with an aim of uniting Kenyans to confront the country’s challenges. On the other hand, Raila will tour Nakuru on Sunday, beginning his day with a church service at the K.A.G church in Mwisho wa Lami. Thereafter, he will make a stopover in Mwisho wa Lami, Mau Narok, Likia and Mauche. Raila will have several stop-overs at Kihingo, Njoro Posta, Stoo Mbili, before holding rallies at Soko Mjinga and Mazembe Grounds. During their visits to different parts of the country on Saturday, Raila said he will seal all corruption loopholes if he forms the next government. Raila said Kenyans have been losing a lot of money through dubious corruption deals and that should change in the next administration. “The biggest challenge facing our country is corruption and that has been stabilizing our economy for a long time,” he said. He added that he knows well how the government works and how to generate revenue that will uplift the lives of Kenyans.
