Police in Migori have launched investigations after Friday’s dawn incident where the headless body of a woman was found in Awendo town. Schoolgoing children saw a bloody sack left on the roadside within the town and alerted people who called police. Suna East subcounty police boss Esau Ochorokodi, speaking on behalf of county police commander Mark Wanjala, said they got the first report at 6am. “A community leader alerted the police who arrived at the scene and found the body of an adult woman stuffed in a sack. It was headless,” Ochorokodi said. He said the body was taken to Migori referral hospital pending postmortem and they have launched investigations to first identify the woman and bring suspects to book. “We are calling on the general public to help police with investigations by availing information on suspects. We have increased patrols and intelligence gathering,” Ochorokodi said. The incident has reignited calls by Awendo town residents to have a police station in the area. Since the start of this year, Awendo town residents have been grappling with insecurity. Earlier in the month, a watchman was hacked to death and a teacher at Manyatta Primary School escaped death after his left wrist was hacked by attackers. Residents led by Jared Osawa said for a long time, politicians in the area have been talking about the insecurity issue. “Since the start of multi-party politics, the building of a police station in Awendo town has been an agenda for politicians. We need one immediately,” Osawa said. In a past interview, former Awendo MP Jared Kopiyo said the only police station residents can access is inside Sony Sugar company. “Because the miller is a parastatal, it has guards and this has dissuaded the public from seeking help there,” Kopiyo said. Last week, Awendo MP Walter Owino called on residents to work closely with police to end security in the town.
