I have always wanted to try out a corn dog. I mean, I always hear of their awesomeness in movies and I’m always intrigued. Although their origin dates back to the United States, they're not the originators of this tasty snack. They were first introduced by German Texans in the 1920s. It was first made as sausage rolled in cornbread battered and fried. But years later, sticks were added to corn dogs as a unique food-holding tool, which gave rise to the modern corn dog. It’s not really an exotic dish, but it’s really delicious and easy to prepare with ingredients that you can find at supermarkets near you. Ingredients Note: You can adjust measurements to this recipe depending on the number of corn dogs you wish to make. Method Poke one end in the middle of the Vienna with a wooden skewer and slowly push the skewer through the Vienna so that the skewer doesn’t poke out midway. Ensure the skewer reaches just the tip of the other end of the Vienna and doesn’t poke out. Dust them with flour and set them aside. In a bowl, mix all your dry ingredients. Add the buttermilk and slowly whisk the ingredients. Add in the eggs and continue to whisk until the batter is thick and smooth. Ensure the batter is heavily thick in order to coat the hot dogs nicely. Heat a large pan on medium heat and pour in oil to halfway cover the pan. Pour in the batter in a tall glass then dip each Vienna in the batter till fully coated. Dip around 2-3 corn dogs in the hot oil, to avoid overcrowding your pan. Cook for around 2-4 minutes each, turning them with a spatula. Allow them to cook until evenly golden brown. Set them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil and allow them to cool Serve with a side of your favourite dip. Enjoy.
