Sausage stew is a tasty yet edgy alternative way of changing up your everyday meals. Not only is it easy to prepare but it's also quite affordable as well and you can curate it to appease your taste buds. Like with most stews, you can have it curried or dry depending on the accompaniment of choice. Ingredients Method In a frying pan over medium heat, add cooking oil and allow it to heat. Add the sausages and let them cook for 5-7 minutes or until they brown. Remember to occasionally switch the sides so that they don't burn. Set the sausages aside and allow them to cool. Chop your onions and tomatoes (separately) then add oil in a cooking pot and allow it to heat. Add your onions, allow them to brown then add the tomatoes and cover the cooking pot. Slice the sausages into medium circles then add them to the cooking pot and stir gently. Add all your spices and the chopped garlic and stir once again, allow the sausages to absorb the flavours then add water and soy sauce and bring it to boil. Add milk to the stew (optional) then switch to low heat and allow the meal to simmer for a few minutes. Turn off heat and serve with accompaniment of choice. Enjoy.
