National teams that have applied to make Meru's Kinoru stadium their home ground will have to wait for at least two months for completion of delayed renovations. Municipality MCA Elius Murega said the stadium was to be completed much earlier but there are no floodlights as well as necessary amenities. The renovations were initiated in 2014 by the then Meru Governor Peter Munya. Several teams, including Tusker FC, have expressed an interest to play matches at the stadium. Sports Kenya director Alfred Bariu said the stadium will be handed over to the county and the people of Meru in the next two months after completion. Bariu spoke on Sunday at Kaaga Primary School during the launch of Governor Kiraitu Murungi's football tournament that will see 450 teams compete from 45 wards, with each team receiving uniforms and balls. “The tournament begins next month at the ward level then will move to the subcounty level and finally culminate in finals at the county level by June," Kiraitu said. "The winning teams at the county level will receive Sh500,000, 300,000 and 100,000 for numbers one, two and three respectively," the county boss added. "Those that win at the subcounty level will receive Sh100,000, 50,000 and 30,000 respectively, while the winning teams at the ward level will go home with 50,000, 30,000 and 10,000.” The stadium, which has been constructed to international standards at a cost of Sh900 million, is set to host athletics, football tournaments and other events. Kiraitu said he will continue such developments and initiatives, including other programmes to empower the youth of Meru. Deputy Governor Titus Ntuchiu announced that the stadium will be available to local teams and players in order to promote talents among the youth in the county. (edited by Amol Awuor)
