The Director of Public Prosecutions has filed an application seeking the arrest and extradition of Abdulrahman Imran Juma aka Abdul aka Rahaman to the United States of America. The application was filed before the Chief Magistrate Court at the Milimani Law Courts on November 30, 2021. The application was made upon receipt of a request from the Government of the United States of America seeking the arrest and extradition of the fugitive to the United States of America. On the April 29, 2021 the Grand Jury for the United States District Court for the Central District of California charged Juma with the violation of three counts of offences, namely conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and aggravated identity theft. The fugitive is said to be part of a syndicate that orchestrated a scheme with his co-conspirators who are already before the United States District Court for the Central District of California to defraud a victim who was seeking a lender to invest in a project to build a school. The DPP, through SADPP, Catherine Mwaniki, has since made an application seeking that the fugitive remain in custody pending the hearing of the extradition application, and the court will give its ruling on the 25th January, 2022.
