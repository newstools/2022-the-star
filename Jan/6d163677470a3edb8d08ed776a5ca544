Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) will name the final 20-member squad for the men and women's team next week ahead of the African Cup of Nations scheduled for  January 17-23 in Accra, Ghana. Both teams returned to non-residential training on Wednesday at City Park and Dashmesh stadiums respectively in a bid to fine-tune their preps for the bi-annual event. In a bid to arrest their dwindling fortunes, five senior players have been included in the initial men's team. The Butali Warriors quartet of George Mutira, Maxwel Wakhungu, Kennedy Munialo and Festus Onyango will offer guidance to the youthful side. Sikh Union's Allan Iningu is also in the mix. KHU secretary-general, Wycliffe Ongori, who doubles up as the men's team manager, observed that coaches are burning the midnight oil to get the players into shape. Youngsters dominate the 25-member squad as Kenya seeks to build for the future. "We assembled a team of 25 players but that will be whittled down to 20 on Thursday. Only 18 players are to be in a matchday squad.  The extra will be cover for injuries and in case of Covid-19 infections because we are living in freakish times." He added: "We have a lot of new faces in the two squads because our objective is to assemble a team for the long term. I expect the seniors to guide the juniors  as they have the necessary experience to mentor the upcoming athletes. The average age is 25 or thereabout" The honcho, nevertheless could not confirm when exactly the contingent will depart for duty. "We are still negotiating with the government. Our initial date was on the 14th but we'll see what happens in the coming days." Kenya men's team is in Pool 'A' alongside Namibia and reigning champions South Africa. Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda are in Pool 'B'. The Jacquiline Mwangi-led women's side will rub shoulders with Ghana, Nigeria and the hosts in Pool'B' while South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe will make up Pool 'A'.
