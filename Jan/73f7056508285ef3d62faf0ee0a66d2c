Deputy President William Ruto has told off his critics of his church donations likening them to the biblical Tobiah and Sanballat. Ruto said supporting the church is biblical and he will not be distracted by the naysayers who have been condemning his donations to the clergy. The DP likened his critics to Tobiah and Sanballat who tried in vain to stop Nehemiah from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. “We are not going to listen to Tobiah, we are not going to listen to Sanballat, we are going to join together in the building of the church,” Ruto said. The statement appeared aimed at ODM leader Raila Odinga who has been critical of DP’s huge donations to church harambees. “I want to tell you that we shall work together towards building the church as commanded in the Bible,” he stated. “Those who have problem with our contribution in the church should know that even if we don’t donate then God has a plan for the building of the church.” The DP was speaking when he attended Sunday church Service at PCEA Neema- Pipeline, Embakasi South Constituency. The second in command also called on the church to pray for the nation as the country heads to August 9, elections. “As Christians who believe in God, I beseech you to continue praying for us and the country so that we have one indivisible country,” he said DP will today (Sunday) address a huge rally at Jacaranda grounds in Babu Owino’s Embakasi East Constituency.
