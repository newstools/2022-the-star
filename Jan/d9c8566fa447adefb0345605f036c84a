Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi beat Kenya’s Erick Ooko by four shots, to claim the sixth leg of the 2021/2022 Safari Tour series at the par 72 Limuru Country Club course on Wednesday. Chinhoi fired a two-under-par 70 to rack up his second win of the 2021/22 Safari Tour season at Limuru  County Club. The Zimbabwean saw off Ooko in a scintillating round four proceedings where Ooko dipped in the back nine. In winning the Limuru leg, Chinhoi collected Sh319,091 while Ooko and Njoroge took home Sh176,364 and Sh148,364 respectively for finishing second and third. “This is not the kind of scores I had anticipated, but all the same, I am happy to have emerged the winner against very good players Madoya and Ooko," said Chinhoi, who leads the regional players in the “Road to Magical Kenya Open with a total of 104 points “I am looking forward to the remaining two events at Karen and Muthaiga, where I hope to return better scores as we gear towards the Magical Kenya Open." The duo, who were in the company of Day Three joint-leader Justas Madoya, went for each other's jugular until the 12th hole, where Chinhoi took the lead and clung onto it to the very end. Ooko looked promising in the first nine where the Zimbabwean had reduced his lead to a solitary shot. But things changed in the back nine when Ooko goofed on his putting. Another bogey on the 13th all but ended the contest, though a bogey by Chinhoi on the 15th narrowly revived hopes of a 'photo-finish'. “I was really looking forward to winning this event, having led in three rounds. Unfortunately, my tee shots let me down today and in particular at the back nine where I was either pulling to the left or hitting to the right. This made it difficult for me to hit enough greens on regulation," said Ooko. “I know I have qualified for the Open but I would like to win the remaining events because that will give me the confidence I need as we approach the Magical Kenya Open." The Zimbabwean calmly parred holes 16 and 17 before unleashing the killer blow with a birdie on the last hole to hold on to another famous triumph on the Tour. Madoya couldn't match the top two hence denying fans what actually appeared to be a three-horse fight. This happened when the Uganda Open champion dropped five shots in the opening nine including an expensive double bogey on the ninth when he went out of bounds off the tee. The Great Rift Resort professional then failed to recover lost ground in the back nine and ended his day on seven over-par-79  to finish a distant fourth, one shot behind Njoroge. David Wakhu recovered on the last day with an amazing four-under-par 68  to finish seventh overall ahead of Mike Kisia and Simon Ngige. Chinhoi's first win of the season came in October 2021 at the par 72 VetLab Sports Club. He is currently one of the most consistent players in the Kenya Open Golf Limited-organised Safari Tour — being used as a yardstick to pick regional pros for the Kenya Open. The remaining two rounds of the Tour will take place in Karen and Muthaiga next month.
