OKA principals Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Kanu party leader Gideon Moi on Saturday led a voter registration mobilisation exercise at Mulu Mutisya Grounds in Machakos County. The duo was also accompanied by NARC Kenya party leader Martha Karua. Gideon Moi called on the residents of lower Eastern to be united behind their leader Kalonzo Musyoka. He praised Kalonzo and Karua for stating that they are uncorrupted and principled. Kalonzo praised Karua for her integrity in leadership. He said she is both a national and international leader with an unmatched image. "We are here to assure the Kenyans that we are together until the last day," he said. On her part, Karua said that Kenyans had many problems, and their rights had been infringed. "We want to tell the country that the fifth Kenyan president is here," Karua said.
