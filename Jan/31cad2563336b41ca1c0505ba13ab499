Omena is a Kenyan meal enjoyed by most people from the lakeside or coastal region. It is often identified with its silvery nature. Omena usually has a bitter taste especially when you don’t cook them properly. Here is how to make the bitter taste go away: Preparation Make sure you wash or soak your Omena in hot water for at least 5 minutes, to remove any dirt residue. When the water is too dirty, repeat the process until the water is almost clear. Then, squeeze off any excess water before transferring it to a clean container. The warm water removes the dirt and smell, so boil for 4 minutes to eliminate the bitter taste. To save you the hustle, you can buy packaged omena in the supermarket or a nearby Soko. Ingredients Instructions Step 1 Heat oil in a sufuria over medium heat and add onions. Fry them until golden brown. Step 2 Add in tomatoes and stir until they are tender and crushed. Add salt and black pepper to your desired taste. Step 3 Add in the Omena, mix well, cover and cook for 4 minutes. Step 4 (Optional) Add in the chopped coriander leaves and stir for one minute. Step 5 Remove from heat and serve over cold water, squeeze lemon and enjoy! Serve with Ugali, rice, spinach, managu or desired greens.
