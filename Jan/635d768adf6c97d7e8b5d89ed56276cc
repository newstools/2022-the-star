Kenya men's volleyball team is ranked fifth continentally and 61st in the world, according to the latest rankings released by the continental volleyball governing body (CAVB) and the world governing body (FIVB) respectively. Previously, the team placed 13th in Africa and 98th globally, and their improvement in rankings is as a result of their participation in the African Cup of Nations in Rwanda last year. North Africans maintained their dominance with Tunisia, Egypt, Cameroon and Morocco occupying the first four positions. Uganda,  Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Nigeria also made the top ten. Kenya defied odds to beat giants Egypt in a five-set thriller despite losing to Morocco in Afcon. National team coach Gideon Tarus, who believes there is more to come from his charges, appealed to the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) to help them realise their top-three dream in the continent. "I am delighted for what we have achieved in such a short span of time. The players need more exposure and participation in the international competitions to make them believe they can rub shoulders with the best." "Beating Egypt was another milestone. North African teams are competitive but beatable. I still insist we need thorough preparations for major tournaments." Afcon was Kenya's only competition in five years.
