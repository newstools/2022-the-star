Former Mwingi North MP John Munuve has said President Uhuru Kenyatta saved him after a failed re-election in 2017. Munuve was appointed the chairman of the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority in 2018 by the President. He said he owes his survival to Uhuru. Munuve spoke on Saturday during the burial of Tabitha Kavula Kirugi in Kyuso. Munuve said he will campaign for Kalonzo in his presidential bid. In 2013, the former MP through the Wiper party won the parliamentary seat but moved to the Jubilee party where he sought re-election but lost. Munuve said he will attempt to reclaim his former seat, currently held by Wiper’s Paul Musyimi Nzengu, on a Jubilee ticket. He said there was too much jostling for the Wiper ticket and he was not ready for such an intense nomination contest. The former MP said he hoped Kalonzo would accord all competitors for the Mwingi North parliamentary seat a level playing ground without interference in favour of his Wiper party candidate. Kyuso ward MCA Stephen Musili told the mourners to vote for a Wiper governor and MCAs. This, he said, will help the Kitui county government operate smoothly, meet the aspirations and expectations of residents. “This is the only option for residents and they will never regret it,” he said. He said currently the working relationship between the majority of MCAs who belonged to Wiper and Governor Charity Ngilu of the Narc party has always been frosty affecting service delivery.
