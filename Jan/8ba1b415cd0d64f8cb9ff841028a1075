Nairobi Woman Rep Esther Passaris is in mourning  following the death of her father, which she announced on social media on Friday night. Passaris described her 79-year-old father as a loving husband, an incredible dad and a doting Papou (grandfather). "A part of me has died today. The heavens opened and ended my father's suffering," she wrote. "A naval architect by profession, my dad achieved a lot in his 79 years. From building the first ship in Kenya, the MV Mwewe, to coaching and mentoring the young men of Ngome Football Club in Mombasa." In another post she said, "Dad worked for Southern Engineering Company Limited, COMARCO, before incorporating HELMACO, which he led until retirement. But looking back, none of his achievements compare to the family man that he was..." Passaris mourned her father as a God fearing man who prayed for protection over his family and country. "Though I'm heartbroken, it is well with my soul," she said.
