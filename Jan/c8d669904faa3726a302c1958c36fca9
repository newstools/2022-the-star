Kabras RFC centre Bryceson Adaka is expected back in the squad in the next two weeks after recovering from a shoulder injury. Adaka was injured in the Kenya Cup final against KCB at Nandi Bears in September before undergoing surgery. Head coach Jerome Muller confirmed he expects the inside centre to be back in training in the next fortnight. “ I expect him to return and give us options as we enter a very crucial period of the season,” said Muller Adaka was in superb form for the sugar millers and his displays earned him a call up to the Kenya Simbas for last year's Rugby World Cup qualifiers. Muller's charges have made light work of Blak Blad, winning  49-3, Nakuru 31-3, Mwamba 46-17 and Impala 24-12. The sugar millers top the log with 20 points and have a 100 per cent record. Muller said there is room for improvement in the team going forward. "We are trying a new game plan which revolves around the setpiece and the players are responding well though it's taking long. You saw in our last game against Impala it did not work well but we are slowly refining it and I am confident it will work,” noted Muller. The South African tactician, who has been in the country for over a year, said the league is quite competitive with several good players and teams. "The rugby level being exhibited by clubs is quite high and you can't underestimate any team and it makes the league quite competitive,” he added. Muller, whose charges resume the hunt for the Kenya Cup with a home tie against Nondies on Saturday, said he is taking one game at a time. "The league is still in its early days and we must play sharper, smarter and with intensity each week to meet our targets," said Muller. Following the match with Nondies, Kabras will face neighbours Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology before facing Quins and second-placed Menengai Oilers to close out the month.
