President Uhuru Kenyatta has condoled with the family of lawyer Nani Njoroge Nani who passed away on Friday at a Nairobi hospital after a long illness. In his message of condolence, the President Njoroge as an accomplished lawyer whose service to the nation shall be dearly missed. Until his demise Njoroge was the Chairman of the Postal Corporation Board of Directors. The Head of State prayed to God to grant the family, friends and relatives of Njoroge divine fortitude at this difficult period of mourning. Former Law Society of Kenya President Nelson Havi also took to Twitter to reminisce about his time working with Njoroge. "Six months after admission, I won a case against Nani Mungai. “I will double your pay” was what he said when we had lunch a week after. It was a fair deal. We won many major cases together at MMC and after I set up on my own. Death has won this time around by sharp practice," Havi said. Njoroge Nani Mungai was appointed to the Board on August 2020. As the Chairman of the Postal Corporation of Kenya Board as well as being a senior Partner at MMC Asafo Njoroge was in charge of Projects, Infrastructure  and Capital Markets. He advised on the largest IPO in East and Central Africa which entailed the sale of 25 per cent of the Government of Kenya's shareholding in Safaricom at the then Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE). He acted for the Kenya Airports Authority and advised it on the proposed airport concession of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport through a privately initiated investment proposal. Njoroge also represented the owners and developers of electricity projects including wind, solar and geothermal projects in all aspects of conceptualization and development of the projects.
