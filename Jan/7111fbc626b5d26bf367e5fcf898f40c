OKA principals , Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka and Gideon Moi have parted ways with ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi over the latter's link with Deputy President William Ruto. In a statement on Sunday the principals said 'it is time to end the nasty political games'. "We (OKA) have today walked out of Mudavadi's 'earthquake' meeting. Our principals out of respect honoured his invitation as a co principal to attend the Bomas event and congratulated him for being nominated by his party to go and look for more friends," OKA Spokespersons Fredrick Okango said. "Unfortunately we have to part ways since some of his friends are not our friends and we are unsafe with them. We are therefore moving to higher grounds where Kenyans are safer." They added, "It is time to move forward, it is time to end the nasty political games. We would like to wish Mudavadi the best of luck as he joins his other partners. There is no room for damages." Businessman Jimi Wanjigi, Senator Moi,  Kalonzo shocked Kenyans when were seen storming out of the conference room. They are said to have changed their minds at the last minute following reports that the DP Ruto would be there. Ruto allies were also seen at the Mudavadi conference at Bomas signaling a possible dalliance with UDA. Among those present were Murang'a senator Irungu Kang'ata, LSK's Nelson Havi, Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa among others. Last week, a war of words rocked the One Kenya Alliance as allies of Kalonzo and Mudavadi tore into each other. The war of words dramatically diminished the possibility of a joint presidential Oka flagbearer as a rancorous split looms. Mudavadi's troops accused Kalonzo of insincerity and rigidity in his presidential bid, saying the Wiper boss is not ready to listen to the opinions of others in the tattered alliance. Kalonzo’s men hit back, accusing Mudavadi of always having one leg out the door and challenged him to be clear on his commitment to the alliance.
