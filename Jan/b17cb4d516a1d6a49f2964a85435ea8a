ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi is besieged, his troops are bitterly split and his backyard is under onslaughts by ODM boss Raila Odinga and DP William Ruto. Musalia is faced with the problem of going it alone to the ballot for president, which is his dream, or teaming up with Raila or the Deputy President, both undesirable. However, even if he were to join Raila or Ruto, his position would be undesirable. Both rivals are looking for a running mate from Mt Kenya and Mudavadi wants to be president.
