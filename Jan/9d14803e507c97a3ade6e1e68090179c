Nocturna Valencia 15km champion Joyce Chepkemoi is among top performers from last weekend's national cross country championships keen on the Agnes Tirop Memorial Word Cross Country Tour on February 12 at the Lobo Village, Eldoret. Chepkemoi, who claimed the national 10km senior women's title at the absence of Defence Forces teammate and predecessor Hellen Obiri, will be joined by national under 2o cross country champions Faith Cherotich and Benson Kiplangat. “My focus is to run at the World Cross Country Tour," said Chepkemoi. "After that, I will now know how the programme of the year will be like and plan accordingly." World U20 3000m steeplechase bronze medallist Cherotich beat world under 20 1,500m champion Purity Chepkirui to the title and insists she is now ripe to take a stab at another title. “My target now is to compete at the World Cross Country Tour. However, we shall sit down with my coach to plan well. The world event needs total preparations because it will not be easy at all,” said Cherotich. The Form Two student at Kalyet Secondary School added that she will have to work smart, juggling school and training. “Yes I need to compete at the race but it also poses a challenge since I have to balance between education and training,” she said. Kiplangat, the world U20 5,000m champion, said he is also keen to challenge for another title. “Winning Saturday's race was a plus for me after coming from another race. This has motivated me to compete at the World Cross Country Tour,” he said.
