Businessman Jimi Wanjigi has been freed by a Nairobi court after the DPP confirmed that there is a High court order staying his prosecution. Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Bernard Ochoi ruled that the proceedings cannot proceed until further directions are given by the High court. " I lift the warrant of arrest against Wanjigi and order that he be set free and released from custody", Ochoi ruled. The magistrate also suspended summons issued against Wanjigi's wife Irene Nzisa. Summons will remain in force against the six other suspects. This is after the DPP through Eveline Onuga told court that she had perused the High court order issued on Tuesday and was satisfied with its legitimacy. "We are satisfied with the order and in that case, we abide by it", Onuga said. The stay order is for Wanjigi and his wife Nzisa. She, however, stated that the police will go ahead and arrest the six other suspects who were summoned to appear in court next week on Monday for plea taking. They will be charged with several counts of forgery and fraud. The case for Wanjigi and Nzisa will be mentioned on March 18.
