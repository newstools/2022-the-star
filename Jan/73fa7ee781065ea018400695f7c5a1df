ODM leader Raila Odinga today (Saturday) launched his presidential campaign at Thika Stadium, Kiambu county. Enthusiastic crowds from President Uhuru Kenyatta's Mt Kenya backyard filled the stadium to the brim with tens of leaders attending the event to show support to the opposition chief. Azimio La Umoja placards and fliers saw the stadium painted in red and blue. Speaker after speaker endorsed the ODM leader for the presidency even as they urged the Mt Kenya resident not vote in Deputy President William Ruto. The ODM leader pledged to revamp the economy, eradicate poverty and create a good business environment for all Kenyans. Raila at the same time took a swipe at the tangatanga camp for spreading hate speech and inciting their communities against others. Some of the leaders present include governors James Nyoro(Kiambu), Nderiti Muriithi(Laikipia), Hassan Joho(Mombasa) and Francis Kimemia of Nyandarua. Other governors include James Ongwae(Kisii), Anyang Ngong'o of Kisumu and Cyprian Awiti of Homa Bay,  Nakuru governor Lee kinyanjui, Kajiado's Joseph Ole Lenku, Siaya's Cornel Rasanga, Kakamega's Wycliffe Oparanya, Embu's Martin Wambora among others.
