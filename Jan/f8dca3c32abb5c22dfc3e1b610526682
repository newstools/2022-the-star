President Uhuru Kenyatta and First Lady Margaret Kenyatta on Monday night hosted Hungarian President János Áder, his spouse Anita Herczegh and some Kenyan leaders at State House in Nairobi. The Hungarian President arrived in the country on Sunday for a four-day State Visit. Some of the leaders who attended the state banquet are ODM leader Raila Odinga, Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, Kanu chairman Gideon Moi and Ford-K leader Moses Wetang'ula. Others included; Transport CS James Macharia, ICT CS Joe Mucheru, Chief Justice Martha Koome, among others. Deputy President William Ruto was conspicuously absent from the event. During the state banquet, Uhuru hailed the strong bilateral ties between Kenya and Hungary, saying the relationship is driven largely by economic cooperation, trade and investments. At the same time, Uhuru regretted the low volumes of trade and investment flow between Nairobi and Budapest over the last five decades despite the existing huge commercial potential. "To address the low trade volumes, we have to intensify efforts to promote greater linkages and networks between the private sector and business communities in the two countries; and encourage them to take advantage of the economic opportunities existing in our respective countries,” he said. The Head State also said Kenya was counting on the support of Hungary to unlock the economic partnership agreement between the East African Community and the European Union. “Kenya looks forward to the signing of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the East African Community and the European Union to open up greater trading and economic opportunities,” President Kenyatta said.
