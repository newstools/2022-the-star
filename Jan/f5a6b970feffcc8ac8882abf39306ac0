A group of youths from Nyeri county have planned a birthday party for former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in Nyeri town on Friday. One of the organisers, Waithira Maruru, said the group, calling itself Young Turks for Handshake Alliance, will hold the event at Baden Powell memorial site at around 11am. “This is a lobby group that supports the handshake between the former Prime Minister and the President and tomorrow we shall be cutting a cake for Baba,” she said Raila turns 77 years old on Friday and Azimio La Umoja movement supporters are expected at the party. Maruru said the birthday cake has already been prepared and they are waiting for the big day. Others invited to the event include street children who will be treated for lunch and also have a chance to share the cake with the opposition leader’s supporters as they sing for the 2022 presidential hopeful happy birthday songs. Maruru said similar events will also be taking place in other counties countrywide and are being organised by people who support the handshake between the President and former Premier. Raila will celebrate his birthday at Bomas on Friday according to his handlers. He has received several goodwill messages ahead of the day. Kirinyaga Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici, who has previously been a Raila critic, is among leaders who sent an early birthday message. “Happy 77th birthday Jakom,” Ngirici posted on her Facebook account. Ngirici was a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto until late last year when she was irked by the DP’s move to welcome her rival Governor Anne Waiguru to UDA. Others who wished Raila an early happy birthday include Karen ward MCA aspirant Maloba Albert who praised him for his leadership style. "Today I join the many Young people and Leaders who Cherish and Love You for your wholesome Spirit of Kenyanism you Always uphold. It is now in your hands. This gives hope to all of us, that there will be real freedom for all," Maloba said.  Edited by CM
