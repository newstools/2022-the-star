Newly appointed Harambee Starlets assistant coach Ann Aluoch says she feels honoured and elated to have ultimately landed her dream job. Aluoch forms part of the freshly constituted Harambee Starlets technical bench unveiled on Monday by the Football Kenya Federation caretaker committee, following a rigorous interview process conducted last Tuesday. “I feel great to have been granted this opportunity,” said Aluoch. “The selection process was above board and for the first time a national team coach has not been handpicked,” she added. Her contract will run for the next 12 months. Before her appointment, Aluoch was serving her second season as head coach of the second-tier side, Mathare United Women, a role she took up even as the team battled for survival in the country's top tier a year ago. Aluoch believes they have the potential to turn around the fortunes of the national team and steer the country past Uganda when the two nations square off in the Awcon qualifiers in two weeks' time. “Our first task will be to oversee Harambee Starlets' match against Uganda at the Africa Women's Cup of Nations, qualifiers in Kampala,” said Aluoch. “We expect positive results given the enabling environment the government has provided. For the first time, the team will be training inside the main facility at Moi Stadium, Kasarani. “What players need to perform well is job security and that's exactly what the government has provided going forward,” she said. Aluoch brings with her a wealth of experience, having captained Starlets to the Africa Women’s Cup of Nation in Cameroon in 2016. She has also previously served as Kenya Under 20 head coach.
