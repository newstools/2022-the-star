ODM leader Raila Odinga on Sunday took his Azimio campaigns to Nakuru. Raila was received by Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui. The former Prime Minister made various stops where he restated his promise to seal all graft loopholes. “We will fight corruption, which is the greatest enemy of Kenyans. We will do this not only among the top government officials but also at the lower levels,” the ODM leader said. He dismissed critics of his Sh6,000 monthly stipend for vulnerable households saying that having been PM for five years, he knows where the money would come from. The ODM leader and DP William Ruto have been trading barbs over the social protection plan with the latter accusing Raila of encouraging handouts. “I know where the money is and where the loopholes exist. We know those who prefer to carry money in bags for fundraisers and gifts to hoodwink Kenyans.” On national unity, Raila said he was happy to see Kenyans living together, urging Nakuru residents to hold together as “each Kenyans has a right to live anywhere.”
