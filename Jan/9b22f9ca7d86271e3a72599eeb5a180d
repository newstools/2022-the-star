Businessman Chris Kirubi died in June last year at age 80. Since then, many have wondered what would happen with his expansive Sh20 billion estate. In his 1996 will, Kirubi bequeathed his son Robert Kirubi and daughter Mary-Anne Kirubi 80 per cent of the estate while gifting his second daughter Fiona Kirubi Sh4 million. Kirubi did not leave out his four siblings, with each getting Sh500 million. Robert Kirubi and daughter Mary-Anne Kirubi amicably agreed to give Fiona 9.95 per cent of the estate, which they split equally from their shares. “We shall be grateful if you would record the following consent in the above matter. That an order be recorded that Fiona Wambui Kirubi shall receive 9.95 per cent of the share of Robert Kirubi’s and Mary-Anne’s Kirubi’s portion of the estate being 80 per cent of the entire estate,” the consent reads in part. That means she will receive about Sh1.6 billion from her siblings. And what exactly did the late businessman own? Kirubi, a billionaire businessman with interests in diverse sectors, including media, manufacturing and technology, had shares in unlisted companies estimated at Sh12.7 billion. His holding in firms listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is worth Sh3.4 billion. He had invested more than Sh1.8 billion in Bayer East Africa Limited. The agricultural chemicals and pharmaceutical corporation established its roots in the country in 1968. In Haco Industries, Kirubi had 4.5 million shares worth Sh801 million, while International House Limited and Kiruma International Limited are estimated to be worth at least Sh1 billion. At the same time, he held 1,406 shares in Bendor Estates Limited said to be worth Sh5.6 billion. The businessman had accumulated land worth Sh3.1 billion, including one in Loresho worth Sh2 billion and another in Kwale estimated to be worth Sh111 million. Two other properties in Muthaiga and Mtwapa are worth Shh60 million each. He also owned 6 six high-end cars: Mercedes Benz Maybach S500 (Sh30 million), Bentley Continental GT (Sh29 million), Range Rover (Sh26 million), Mercedes Benz (Sh16 million), Mercedes Benz ML 320 CDI (Sh5 million) and Mercedes CLS 350 valued at Sh3 million.
