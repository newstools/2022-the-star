Makueni Governor Kivutha Kibwana has said governors will support ODM party leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. "I consulted my people in my county leadership and they gave me the go-ahead to support Azimio la Umoja and they told me that I have age on my side and will resume my presidential ambitions in future," he said. Kibwana had declared his interest in the top job in 2020. Kibwana who is serving his second and last term as governor said, “I have listened to the voice of Wanjiku asking me to run for presidency in the coming election.” But on Monday he changed tune to join Raila's Azimio la Umoja. Kivutha said the reason why he and others have decided to support Raila is that he has fought for the country. "Raila is the father of devolution and as the president, he will protect devolution. I m happy that the next president will take the country forward,' he said. Mombasa governor Ali Hassan Joho said devolution is here to stay. "Mtu yeyote ambaye ameona mienendo ya ugatuzi, kura yake inapaswa kuwa ya Raila Odinga," he said. Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu warned there’s as danger in electing Deputy President William Ruto as the next president as he has always opposed the Kenyan constitution. "We will go out of our way to ensure Raila Odinga is the president in August," she said. The governors were in a meeting with Raila at Enashipai Resort and Spa Hotel in Naivasha for Azimio la Umoja consultative forum. Raila was accompanied by governors Lee Kinyanjui (Nakuru), Charity Ngilu (Kitui), Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), and Martin Wambora (Embu) among others. The meeting in Naivasha comes two days after Raila launched his presidential campaign in Thika on Saturday where he was endorsed by a section of Kiambu elected leaders.
