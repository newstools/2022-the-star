A man was on Monday charged with invading his ex-wife’s house and threatening to kill her. Munyao Muia allegedly went to Esther Wayua's house on January 7, at Lindi area of Kibra within Nairobi County, took a kitchen knife and threatened to stab her to death. He accused Esther of having 'many men'. Muia denied the charges and pleaded lenient bond terms before Kibera senior principal magistrate Derrick Kuto. He told the court that he was not a flight risk and vowed to abide by the law. Kuto granted him a Sh300,000 bond or a cash bail of Sh30,000. The case will be mentioned on January 27. The magistrate directed that the accused person be supplied with witness statements and documentary evidence that the prosecution will rely on during the case. Edited by Mercy Asamba
