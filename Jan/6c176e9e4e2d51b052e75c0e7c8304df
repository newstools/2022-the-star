Celebrated journalist Hussein Mohamed has acclaimed UDA's bottom-up economic model on his first day as DP William Ruto's Director of Presidential Campaigns Communications. In a statement on Wednesday, Hussein said the model speaks of Rutos's belief in prioritizing and empowering the majority of Kenyans suffering from endemic economic marginalization. "William Ruto is the embodiment of an inclusive, transformative and strategic leadership style that attracts Kenyans with similar intent," he wrote. "UDA promises an economic revolution anchored on the Constitution; taking resources down to the people that really need it." The former Citizen TV news anchor was appointed as Ruto's Head of  Presidential Campaigns Communications on Monday. He will be in charge of Ruto's campaign communications ahead of the August 9, elections. Hussein says UDA and its partners do not believe in entitlement or what he termed as 'madharau'. "...but we believe in equal opportunity, we do not believe in ‘madharau’, we believe in respect and we believe in people power, NOT elite power," Hussein said. Speaking on Keroche Breweries founder Tabitha Karanja joining UDA, he told Kenyans to expect many more entries into the camp. "Tabitha is the personification of a hustler that has worked her way from the bottom up. But once a hustler, always a hustler," he said. "Today’s episode is another of many more to come, simply because our coalition is with the people."
