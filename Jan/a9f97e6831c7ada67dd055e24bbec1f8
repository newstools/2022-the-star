Cotu boss Francis Atwoli on Thursday hosted several Western Kenya MPs allied to ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi. Kakamega woman Rep Elsie Muhanda, Butere Mp Tindi Mwale, Lurambi Mp Bishop Titus Khamala Kwisero Mp Christopher Aseka and former Shinyalu MP Anami visited the Unionist at his Ildamat home in Kajiado. According to Atwoli, the MPs came for a political consultative meeting. Both Khamala and Tindi Mwale are close allies to Mudavadi which raises speculations about why they were meeting a rival. "I was delighted to join Kakamega woman Rep Elsie Muhanda and Cotu SG Atwoli in welcoming Titus Khamala and Tindi Mwale to Azimio la Umoja," Aseka said on a Facebook post after the meeting. On Sunday, Kwisero Mp Aseka decamped from Mudavadi's ANC to Raila Odinga's Azimio la Umoja. "Almost all elected leaders in Kakamega are in Azimio," Aseka said. Last weekend, Mudavadi made a direct attack at Atwoli over his alleged corrupt leadership in the labour sector. Mudavadi said the labour sector is in turmoil and 'inviting ICU' due to Atwoli's poor leadership. The party leader spoke on Sunday during his presidential bid launch at Bomas of Kenya. His sentiments attracted a response from Atwoli who criticised him for agreeing to work with Deputy President William Ruto saying he has 'shamed' the Luhya community. "... who told him he's going to be President? Befriending Ruto is not the key to Presidency. He has ashamed the Luhyas by allowing Ruto to fund his NDC," Atwoli wrote. "As I said earlier, ANC and FORD-K are political commercial kiosks   for  Mudavadi and Wetangula." Atwoli said he will respond fully to Mudavadi's surprise deal with Ruto on Monday. "Mudavadi, in 1994 while minister for finance, sneaked in the redundancy clause into the Finance Bill of 1994, as suggested by the World Bank, which allowed employers to declare redundancy without consulting workers. So how will he empower workers?" Atwoli added.
