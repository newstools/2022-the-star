Rev Lucy Natasha is officially off the market after getting married to her fiancé Prophet Stanley Carmel in a traditional ceremony on Saturday. Natasha shared photos from the event. "Love is a sweet thing, when you find your better half, the days are filled with joy, happiness and fulfilment. Happy moments during our traditional wedding," she wrote. They wore matching creme traditional attires. In a video shared online, the groom was given the task of identifying his 'love' among a group of women. The wedding comes less than two months after Carmel, an Indian preacher, proposed to his lover at a church event. The traditional wedding was attended by close friends and family. Celebrities present included Bonfire Adventures couple Kabu and Sarah. Carmel had earlier confessed to wooing Natasha via social media. "I slid into her DM."
