Kirinyaga Governor Ann Waiguru has said that the deep state and system will not be able to convince Mt Kenya, not to back Deputy President William Ruto. Speaking at Ruto's mega rally in Eldoret, Waiguru said the region pledged to support Ruto and the government would not change the position. "We have said as people of Mt Kenya that we will not be intimidated or confused to support the so called handshake," she said. The governor said the people of Mt Kenya had decided on their own to back the DP, and nothing would change the decision. She vowed to stay put in Ruto's camp, despite pressure from the deep state and government. "There are those who get shaken when they see me seated with DP Ruto but they will get more shaken," Waiguru said. She said UDA was the party of choice in Kirinyaga same as the presidency for William Ruto. Waiguru's remarks came shortly after MPs allied to the second in command said ODM leader Raila Odinga represents the past. The leaders said Ruto stands for the future urging the Rift region to free the DP so that he seeks votes elsewhere. Allies of the DP Saturday made the passionate plea to residents of Rift Valley to back Ruto and set him free to look for votes outside the region. They spoke at Ruto's mega rally in Eldoret.
