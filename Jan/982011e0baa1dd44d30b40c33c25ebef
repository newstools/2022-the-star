The Kisumu county assembly staff have been given 10 days off to go to their villages and mobilise residents to register as voters. Only essential service providers have been exempted. The assembly has 140 staff. Speaker Elisha Oraro said only a few people have turned up to register as voters. “I urge everybody who has not yet done so to ensure they are not left out,” he said. Oraro said each member should mobilise at least two people per day to register as voters. He urged those who have not collected their IDs to do so and register as voters. The speaker said they were holding a consultative meeting to look at their last year’s achievements and lay a roadmap for this year. He said they need to ensure all potential voters in their neighbourhood register as voters. This comes days after the Kisumu Governor Anyang' Nyong'o gave all the county workers two weeks off to mobilise their families and friends to register as voters. Nyong'o said on Monday the region was lagging behind in voter registration. He said county employees should work with ward administrators to ensure people are registered. Nyong'o said they should report to ward administrators and have morning meetings before undertaking their journey for mobilisation. “We must all come out and mobilise people to register and support our own who is contesting for the presidency,” he said. “By the end of this week, we should see better results from what we have now,” he said Edited by Kiilu Damaris
