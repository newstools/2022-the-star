DP William Ruto has taken a swipe at Wiper leader Kalonzo for supporting ODM party leader Raila Odinga for the presidency. "Mimi sina shida na mtu yeyote, nilisaida Raila hadi akawa Prime Minister lakini ilifika wakati nikagundua hapendi Mungu nikachoka nikamwachia Kalonzo," he said. Loosely translates to: (I have no problem with anyone, I helped Raila when he was the Prime minister but it reached a point where I realised he does not love God, I got tired then surrendered to Kalonzo). "Kalonzo alimsukuma hadi siku hizi nywele yake imekwisha. Ukipata mtu analalamika juu ya Kanisa, jua kuna shida," he said. Loosely translates to (Kalonzo pushed him until nowadays he has no hair. If you get someone complaining about church, there is a problem) Ruto claimed that Raila cannot be pushed to the presidency any further. "I am here so that he(Raila) should not come here to disturb you," he said as he giggled. Ruto further told Raila to shun violence ahead of the August 9 elections. He urged his competitors not to continue to give excuses about violence. "I want to urge my competitors to ensure that in our election equation there is no violence," Ruto said. He spoke during UDA public rally at Kangundo Town in Machakos County on Thursday. "The ODM leader must disown violence. He cannot continue to give excuses about violence," he said.
