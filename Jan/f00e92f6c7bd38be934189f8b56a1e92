Agano Party leader Mwaure Waihiga, who is also the presidential candidate for the Small Parties Coalition in the August 2022 elections wants stern action taken against hatemongers in the country. “I urge the government to take stern actions on hatemongers and also to send strong security in those places with insecurity,” Waihiga said. In his statement, Waihiga urged the government to send strong security in some of the areas in the country that are facing insecurity. “I wish to condemn the hate speeches that are being used by various leaders in the recent past to ignite tribal animosity and the likelihood of what we saw in 2007,” he said. His statement comes as the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the National Cohesion and Integration Commission continue to probe and condemn some of the politicians who have been alleged of hate speech. Waihiga has also expressed his concern for the recent killing of innocent Kenyans in Lamu County, claiming that some of the leaders are benefiting from such chaos. “There is reason to believe that these clashes benefit the political class that has been in positions of power and decision making for the last 10,20,30,40 years.” He added that due to individual, corporate and organised corruption, such clashes come every election year. “By now, after 10 years of leadership, the Jubilee government and even those in government in hustler, handshake, OKA should have addressed this insecurity” In December last year, a total of 20 unfunded political parties endorsed Waihiga in a function that took place at Macha Beach Resort, Machakos county. The leaders agreed that the parties will form a coalition in the coming days before embarking on a nationwide campaign to drum up support for their candidate. Waihiga had promised that if he wins, his administration will fight corruption completely without bias. “These others cannot fight corruption because if you look at their backgrounds, they are joined at the hip in various areas.”
