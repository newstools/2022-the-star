On January 21, Deputy President William Ruto and his entourage stormed West Pokot County for a series of campaign rallies. During the DP’s visit, hundreds of the locals turned up in numbers to hear what the August 9, presidential aspirant had for them. Among the group was a team of boda boda riders who were mobilized to attend the rallies. It is now emerging that the boda boda operators were allegedly supposed to be paid for gracing the DP's rally. This is after a section of the boda boda riders from Sigor took to the streets to protest over unpaid money that was promised to them According to the riders, some UDA leaders and aspirants from the area shortchanged them and went missing with their dues. Joseph Loritoi, the boda boda chairperson who spoke to the press on Thursday lamented that their counterparts in other constituencies where the DP visited were paid on the same day. “Wakati Deputy President alikuja, Mbunge alimpogeza Naibu wa Rais kwa pesa enye alitoa na akasema kwamba tumenunua pikipiki kumi na tisa na amewapa watu wa bodaboda, lakini si ukweli. Mheshimiwa amesema uongo hapo (the MP thanked the Deputy President for the cash that he had contributed and said that we had bought nineteen new motorbikes, which is different from reality. The MP lied),” Loritoi said. Loritoi’s deputy Dennis Ripis said they welcomed the DP but they were not given what they deserved. “Watoto jioni walilala njaa, na unajua sisi tunalipa loan (children spend the night without food not forgetting that we have loans to pay)." The riders said they postponed their income-generating activities to attend the DP's rally adding that they deserve to be paid. They pleaded with the DP to intervene and fast-track their pay.
