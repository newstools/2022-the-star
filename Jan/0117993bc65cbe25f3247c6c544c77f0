First-half goals from Violet Nanjala and Noel Aruko, were enough to earn Trans-Nzoia Falcons a well-deserved 2-1 win over Bunyore Starlets in a closely contested Kenya Women's Premier League match at Mumboha Stadium on Saturday. Nanjala gave the visitors the lead in the fifth minute. Three minutes before halftime, Aruko doubled the lead and Susan Malda's 46th-minute goal was a mere consolation. This was Bunyore's first loss at home. Trans-Nzoia Falcons coach Justine Okiring lauded his charges for playing according to instructions. "We had a plan for them (Bunyore) and the girls just executed on the field. I couldn't ask for more. We want to build momentum and accrue as many points as possible," Okiring said. His opposite number Daniel Arunga blamed the referee for poor officiating but promised to bounce back when they face Kisumu All Starlets next weekend. "Some decisions went against us but we can't cry. We also have a depleted squad with only 15 players therefore there's need to sign players in defense and midfield," Arunga hinted. "Our sole aim is to avoid relegation. We still have more matches and points to be won." Elsewhere, Kenya Women Premier League defending champions Thika Queens shared spoils with Zetech Sparks in a 1-1 all draw. Catherine Githae's 14th-minute strike was cancelled out by Alukwe Puren's sumptuous goal in the 48th minute. Nakuru City Queens also drew 1-1 with Ulinzi Starlets at ASK Showground, Nakuru. Nambangala Nyongesa scored for the hosts before Lanoline Aoko levelled for the soldiers. In another match, Gaspo Women heaped more misery on Kangemi Ladies by hammering the newbies 3-0.
