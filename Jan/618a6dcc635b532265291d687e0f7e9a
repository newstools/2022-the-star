Uganda will not endorse any candidate in Kenya’s August General Election, President Yoweri Museveni has said. In an exclusive interview with the New Vision in Uganda, Museveni said the elections are Kenyans' affairs and that his country does not take sides. “Elections in Kenya or any other African country are a matter for the people of that country,” Museveni said. “We never take sides in the internal affairs of other countries. So, we have no side in the Kenya elections.” Museveni has been meeting Kenyan leaders in a bid to collaborate with them in different sectors for the betterment of the economy. Last year, Museveni invited Deputy President William Ruto as his chief guest during the official laying of the foundation stone for a vaccine manufacturing facility. The event took place in Matuga, Wakiso district where the construction of the Biological Drugs and mRNA vaccine which is under Dei Group manufacturing facility is located at. Ruto said that the commitment to buying locally manufactured vaccine doses at a large scale will ease African countries’ import bills, enhance their export earnings and sustainably boost the ordinary people’s health status. Later on, Ruto was blocked from flying to Uganda as his animosity with President Uhuru Kenyatta played out in the open. Ruto was set for a private trip to the neighbouring country — the second time in a month — but was blocked by immigration officials at Wilson airport. Sources said immigration officials insisted Ruto had to get clearance from the President. However, the DP’s aides accused Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i of issuing the decision to stop Ruto’s trip.
