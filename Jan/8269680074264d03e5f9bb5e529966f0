Football Kenya Federation presidential hopeful, Twaha Mbarak, has contributed Sh200,000 to Kenya Football Legends, who are heading to Uganda for a series of friendly matches. During the ceremony that took place at the City Stadium in Nairobi earlier in the week, Mbarak also unveiled an elaborate plan geared towards improving the welfare of Kenyan footballers if given a chance to preside over football in the country. “We are gathered here today for a very noble course, which is to partner with the Kenya Football Legends. “The first step is to support them in their trip which will help them benchmark and network with their counterparts in our neighbouring country, Uganda,” said Mbarak. “We shall look for sponsors to help the legends pursue courses in coaching, club management, and soccer agency, which will help them get employment in various departments connected to sports,” said Mbarak. “We shall encourage the current players to also take these courses to help them transit well after they retire from playing soccer,” he added. The legends who graced the ceremony include Tusker head coach Robert Matano, former Harambee Stars captains Dennis Oliech and Musa Otieno. Twaha has since expressed interest in becoming the next Football Kenya Federation (FKF) with Andrew Amukoa as his running mate. The Football Kenya Federation Caretaker Committee appointed by Sports Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed in November last year has been busy laying ground for elections of new officials in the coming months
