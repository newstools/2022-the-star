ODM leader Raila Odinga will on Monday take his Azimio la Umoja campaigns to Kajiado county. This is another series of his efforts to consolidate the Maa community's votes as a block. This will be his third meeting with the Maa community in less than two weeks. On January 25, the former PM was part of a team that held a meeting between the community leaders and the Mt Kenya Forum held at Safari Park hotel. A few days before, the ODM leader had met Maa leaders from Narok county led by Senator Ledama Olekina. Raila's Azimio la Umoja Movement has been calling on leaders and Kenyans from all walks of life to join them as they seek to form the next government. On Sunday, the ODM leader campaigned in Nairobi's Dagoretti North area. Deputy President William Ruto on his part campaigned in President Uhuru Kenyatta's Kiambu backyard.
