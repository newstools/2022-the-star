On Monday, Kenyans on Twitter were furious after fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) announced that it had run out of potatoes. In a statement, KFC said that Kenyans loved their chips over the festive season, which they have now run out of. The fast-food outlet said that as it is working to resolve the potatoes shortage, it will offer alternatives, including buns and Ugali. "Fam it was truly a Furaha December.  Mlikula sherehe with your KFC faves. Ya'll loved our chips a little too much, and we've run out," KFC tweeted. "Sorry! Our team is working hard to resolve the issue. In the meantime here are some SWAP options for combo meals if you are craving our Kuku." KFC alongside various other fast food outlets has been importing potatoes from abroad, 'to keep up with international standards' of the various franchises. Potato production has also been on the decline with many countries reporting shortages in December 2021. The United States, Japan and South Africa are among countries that reported shortages. According to Business Daily, KFC CEO for East Africa, Jacques Theunissen attributes the shortage to delays in shipping lines due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Ships have been delayed for more than a month now, but we are working hard to restore as the first containers are arriving in the port tomorrow (Tuesday)." The announcement, however, did not augur well with many Kenyans who expressed their disappointment, questioning why KFC could not source potatoes locally. Here are some of their reactions;
