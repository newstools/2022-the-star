A 39-year-old woman died Monday morning after she was attacked by her employer’s dog, as she went about her house chores in Moriema’s area of Malindi town. Witnesses told police Roselyn Nafuna had opened the door leading to the porch when she was attacked by the dog, a South African Boerboel famed for its well-developed muscles and a strong bone structure. According to a night guard on duty at the home John Siria, he heads the woman’s distress screams as she was being mauled by the beast. He said he rushed to the scene and restrained the dog, before helping Nafuna who was lying on the floor bleeding. According to the guard, the deceased said that she felt stronger and would go back to the house by herself. However, when the day guard Anthony Katana, reported for duty he found the lifeless body of the deceased sprawled on the floor of the house. Detectives based in Malindi who were among the first responders to the incident established that the deceased’s body had multiple wounds occasioned by the dog’s bites. Investigations into the unfortunate incident have since been launched as the body was moved to a local mortuary, awaiting post mortem.
