The main ingredients for ice cream are water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. However, a lot of other things can be added to come up with different flavours to satisfy one's cravings. Below is a simple eggless homemade strawberry and vanilla ice cream that is guaranteed to have you licking the bowl. Ingredients Method. Wash the strawberries and lemons clean. Dry them then dice the strawberries and squeeze the lemons for juice. In a large bowl, mix strawberries, honey, food colour, sugar, and lemon juice. Stir gently then let them sit 15-20 minutes, or until the strawberries have released their juices. Mash the mixture with a fork or pastry mixer until there are no visible chunks of strawberry pieces (if you prefer a smoother ice cream, you can use a blender or food processor for the mixture.) In the bowl with the mixture add, heavy cream, half and half, milk and vanilla extract. Stir continuously until everything is well combined creamy and thick. Pour the mixture into the freezer bowl of an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's directions. Or pour and freeze it in an airtight container for 3-4 hours. Note: If you puree the strawberries use 2/3 - 1 cup instead of the 1 and 1/2 cups of strawberries stated n the ingredients list. This is because the liquid consistency can make the ice cream less creamy. For smooth scoops, allow the ice cream to sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes to soften before serving. Top with fruits of choice or syrup and enjoy your beautiful creation.
