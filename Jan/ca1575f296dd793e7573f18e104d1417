Golf Park’s Erick Ooko clung onto the lead with level-par 72 as Safari Tour action entered the second day at Limuru Country Club on Monday. Behind him was Great Rift Resort pro Justus Madoya, who also had level-par 72 for the day. “My iron game was excellent except that I could not get some of my putts in, which cost me some birdies and a better finish,’’ said Ooko, who got off with a birdie at the par four-first hole though he dropped a shot soon after. Like Ooko, Madoya equally blamed poor putting for the day’s position. “I had four good chances for birdies but did not make use of them though it is the double at the 13th which made it even worse,” said Madoya, the reigning Uganda Open champion “But that aside, I am still within a reach of my 12 under-par projection, with two more rounds to go,” added Great Valley Golf Resort’s Madoya’s, who dropped a shot at the fifth after picking up a birdie at the third. He was, however, able to level the back nine despite the double at the 13th, after rolling in two birdies at the 15th and 18th. Ooko added that the essence in the last two rounds will be to keep the ball in the fairways and putt it well. Despite his putting woes, Ooko managed to cross to the back nine on 2 under after a birdie at the par five-third and at the ninth. The back nine was not, however, Ooko’s best as he dropped shots over the 11th and 13th for two over par and his level par 72 which left him at the top on two under par 142. Meanwhile, Kenya Railway Golf Club’s Samuel Njoroge, who had shared Day One lead with Ooko, dropped to joint third with Vet Lab’s Mike Kisia and Edwin Mudanyi. Njoroge shot three-over-par 75 for one over par 145 gross while Mudanyi posted one over par 73. Kisia shot the best round in the tournament so far, a four-under-par 68, a score which included four birdies and an eagle at the home green (18th). He, however, dropped two shots at the front nine. Making his first attempt to the top was Zimbabwe’s Robson Chinhoi, who shot one-under-par 71 to move to seventh place on three-over-par 147. A total of 26 players made the eight-over-par 152 cut and will now be chasing the Sh300,000 prize. Those making the cut included two amateurs, John Kariuki of Limuru and junior player Njoroge Kibugu of Muthaiga, who shot five-over par 77, one better than Kariuki, who had started with a 73.
