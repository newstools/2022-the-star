 Valencia Ibercaja 10km champion Daniel Simiu says his win at Sunday's Discovery Kenya Cross country Championship sets him up perfectly for the upcoming World Indoor Championship in Mondeville and Metz, France next month. Simiu clocked 30:14.0 to dethrone last year's champion Robert Kiprop as Elgeyo Marakwet and training mate Kelvin Kibiwott (30:35.9), and Edward Cheserek (30:38.1) came second and third respectively. “I wanted to use this race to prepare for the world indoor championships. I will be competing in Mondeville and Metz in France. Competing and winning here was a great opportunity for me,” said Simiu. In the women's 10km, it was a siblings' affair as Africa Athletics 3,000m steeplechase champion Norah Jeruto overcame her younger sister and the former world under 20 2,000m steeplechase silver medalist, Daisy Jepkemei, to take the top gong. Jeruto and Jepkemei timed 33:29.6 and 34:04.5 respectively as Dorcas Chepchirchir Tuitoek finished third in 34:21.8. Just like Simiu, Jeruto was using the championship to prepare for upcoming international competitions. "Winning today was good for me to prepare for Diamond Leagues and next month’s World Cross Country Tour,” the Baringo native said. A week after winning the national 5km cross country championships, Pamela Kosgei once again proved she's the fastest rising long-distance runner in Kenya when she won the girls' 5km race. The young Kosgei cut the tape in 21:17.9, beating Ednah Chepkemei to second in 21:22.2 and Sharon Chepnegtich, who was third in 21:24.6. Pamela wants to fit into the shoes of her elder sister Brigid Kosgei after winning the 6km junior women In 8km junior men, Nandi-based Ismail Kurui won the title in 24:32.3, relegating Felix Korir to second in 24:34.5 and Brian Kiplimo in the third position by clocking 24:48.7.
