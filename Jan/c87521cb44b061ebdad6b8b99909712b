Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been allowed to leave the Gabon squad at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and return to his club to continue his recovery from Covid-19, his national team coach said on Monday. Midfielder Mario Lemina of French side Nice has also been sent back to his club, with neither having played a minute at the Cup of Nations. “We have taken the wise decision to send them back to their clubs so they can be looked after there,” said Gabon coach Patrice Neveu. The pair had been released from quarantine last week but were then stopped from playing in Friday’s game against Ghana after doctors said cardiac lesions were detected in post-Covid medical examinations. While the rest of the available players trained on Sunday and Monday, the pair awaited the results of further examinations brfore the decision was made to allow them leave Cameroon. Gabon have also been hit by several new infections, including winger Denis Bouanga, substitute goalkeeper Noubi Fotso, left-back David Sambissa, midfielder Serge Ngouali and striker Ulrick Eneme Ella, a statement added. Bouanga, Eneme Ella and Ngouali all featured in their 1-1 draw with Ghana in Yaounde, which lifted Gabon to four points and likely qualification to the last 16. But defenders Gilchrist Nguema, Sidney Obissa and Lloyd Palun and forwards Axel Meye and Kevin Mayi have returned without concerns after their Covid-19 isolation and can be fielded on Tuesday when Gabon meet Morocco in their last group game in Yaounde.
