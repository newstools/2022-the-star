Former Citizen TV news anchor Hussein Mohamed has been appointed as Deputy President William Ruto's Head of Communications. He will be in charge of Ruto's presidential campaigns communications ahead of the August 9, elections. DP Ruto officially welcomed Hussein to his camp after a meeting with him at his official Karen residence. "Hussein Mohamed, a renowned TV journalist, has been appointed Head of Communications in the William Ruto Presidential Campaign. Welcome to the Hustler team," DP said. After exiting citizen TV, Hussein has been working as a communications consultant with NGOs. While announcing his exit from the Royal Media Service, the veteran journalist said he will be engaging in private activities. Although he promised his fans to be back on air soon, after announcing his departure, that never came to be. The celebrated media personnel is famed for his eloquence and hard-hitting tv interviews. His exit from the media sparked uproar among Kenyans who appreciated his style of interviewing political guests in the country. ODM leader Raila Odinga described Hussein as one of the best interviewers the station has ever had. "He struck me as someone who did his homework and knew answers to the questions he asked," he said. Raila said Hussein would ask questions that interviewees would sometimes find irritating, but he was persistent. Royal Media Service Strategy and Innovations director Linus Kaikai described Hussein Mohamed as a fantastic employee.
