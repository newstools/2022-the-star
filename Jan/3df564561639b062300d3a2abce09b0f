Two of the remaining three Africa Cup of Nations matches due to be played at Douala’s Japoma Stadium have been moved to the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaounde. The state of the surface in Douala was criticised during the group stage, and discussions were held about moving games to other venues. However, it will still be the venue for a quarter-final between tournament hosts Cameroon and The Gambia on Saturday. A second quarter-final on Sunday and the semi-final due to be held there on Wednesday, February 2 have been switched to the Cameroonian capital. The Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium will now host both of Sunday’s quarter-finals. The first of those games, between Morocco and Egypt, was scheduled to be staged at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde. But Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe announced that game would be moved following the crush outside the ground on Monday which killed eight people and injured 38 others. The Olembe Stadium is set to host a semi-final on February 3 and the final on February 6 but Caf say it will not stage any more matches until a report into the fatal incident is received. “The Caf Afcon organising committee also requires the assurance and guarantee that appropriate and adequate interventions and measures have been implemented to ensure that a similar incident will not occur at the Olembe Stadium,” a statement said.
