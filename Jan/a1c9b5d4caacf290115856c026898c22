A butcher operating Nyama Choma eateries along the Eastern Bypass in  Nairobi was at the weekend arrested after he was linked to the disappearance of livestock in Machakos. Police said Peter Njenga alias Sonko was arrested after forensic investigations linked him to the raid of a Manyatta on December 16, in Athi River. During the raid, Sh1 million cattle were stolen. Also arrested were the driver and the owner of a lorry that was used to ferry the animals. After checking out the driver’s details in the police criminal database, detectives established that he has a history of ferrying stolen livestock and has a similar case pending at the Mavoko Law courts. Detectives have established that the cattle were driven to the Dagoretti slaughterhouse, where a ready market for livestock including stolen animals thrives. In some instances, the animals are slaughtered in the bush and ferried to popular meat joints. The 41-year-old has left livestock keepers destitute. The suspect is an established butcher. The butcheries are located at strategic places along the Eastern bypass in Utawala and Ruiru towns, where city residents and revellers frequent to enjoy meat and other accompaniments. The suspect’s butcheries offer a kilogram of beef at Sh380. His arrest came after numerous complaints from Athi River-based herders, following an increase in livestock disappearance over the past few months. Police were looking for more suspects over the case. Cases of cattle rustling are on the rise in parts of the North Rift and Northeastern. Most of the animals end up in Nairobi slaughterhouses in a business that has been linked to some of the most powerful individuals. Security officials rarely make arrests over the incidents because of the networks involved. People are killed in some of the raids. This has been a tradition in some areas amid calls for changes on how it happens. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
