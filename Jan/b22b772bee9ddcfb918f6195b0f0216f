The 2021 Africa Junior Champion Angela Okutoyi said she is taking one game a time after a brilliant display at the Junior Australian Open tournament in Melbourne. Okutoyi edged past Italian Federica Urgesi 6-4 7-6(7-5) 6-3 in an entertaining first-round duel and will now play Australian Zara Larke in the second round on Monday. A delighted Okutoyi was happy with her performance, saying: "It was tough match battled hard she was a tough opponent but I am happy I won the match and give me confidence for the second round.” In a tough three-set battle, Okutoyi prevailed in the first set before losing the second set in a tie break but regained her composure to close out the third set. The country's youngest Kenya Open champion said the warm-up event held last week was an eye-opener, which helped greatly in her win on Sunday. “The tournament I played early this week helped to get used to the hardcourt surface under the guidance of some of the ITF coaches,” added Okutoyi. Her coach, Thuku Rogoi, said she should enjoy herself. "She played well, took her points pretty well and when things got tight in the second, set she held her nerve and bounced back to win the third set," said Rogoi.
