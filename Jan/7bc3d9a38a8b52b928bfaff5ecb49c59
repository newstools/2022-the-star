ODM leader Raila Odinga on Friday celebrated his 77th birthday at the Bomas of Kenya. The party which was attended by among others leaders elected on the ODM party and its officials also coincides with the launch of the Azimio la Young Turks. "I loved shaking a leg with the young guys and girls at Bomas. We shared some great laughs, put our best feet forward, and reflected as we celebrated my birthday. Thank you all for the warm birthday wishes," he said in a tweet. What stood out, however, is how the former Prime Minister has been celebrated across the country by different groups of people. Different counties took it upon themselves to ensure this day remains marked by celebrating the father of democracy with cake cutting with the public. The counties include; Mombasa, Kisii, Nakuru, Embu, Mombasa, Homa Bay and Nyamira among others. Other leaders have also taken time to wish Raila a happy birthday through their social media platforms including some of his competitors.
