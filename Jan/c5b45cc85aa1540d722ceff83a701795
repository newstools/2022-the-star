ODM leader Raila Odinga has said that under the Azimio la Umoja movement, there will be room for everyone. He said that the movement is getting stronger and energised by the day. Raila's words came after he met leaders allied to Mudavadi's ANC party on Thursday. The leaders announced that they have officially joined Azimio la Umoja. "Welcome on board Hons. Tindi Mwale (Butere), Oscar Nabulindo (Matungu), Bishop Titus Khamala (Lurambi) and Christopher Aseka (Khwisero). Azimio la Umoja is getting stronger and energized by the day. The house is bigger and everyone will have a room," ODM said in a tweet. Before their meeting with the former Prime Minister, the leaders from Western had a meeting with Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli at his Ildamat home in Kajiado for a consultative meeting. Their commitment to Azimio comes after several elected MCAs allied to ANC and Ford Kenya ditched the parties for Azimio movement. Out of the 16 MCAs, 14 were from Kakamega County while two were from Busia county. Kenyan politicians have been aligning themselves to their preferred parties ahead of the August 9 elections. Deputy President William Ruto's party UDA has also been making notable progress with leaders from various parts of the country joining the party ahead of the polls.
