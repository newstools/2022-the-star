DCI detectives have arrested three men suspected of trying to sell a stolen Toyota Probox in Kericho's Kipchimchim trading centre. Erick Kipkurui Kogo, Philemon Kiprotich Ng'eno and Joseph Achila Ondieki were nabbed in an ongoing crackdown informed by numerous reports of motor vehicle thievery in the county. DCI boss George Kinoti said the manhunt subsequent arrest of the trio followed a stolen car report booked on January 16, 2022, at Litein Police Station, where a KCQ 318K Toyota Probox vanished from a car park. "Aware that the vehicle had been circulated to all police units across the county and beyond, the suspects hid it for a week as they sourced for fake number plates and a potential buyer," Kinoti explained.

Armed with forged documents and replacing the original registration plates with KCU 994X, the three suspects emerged at Kipchimchim trading centre where they hoped to dispose of it. Unknown to them, a joint team of Kericho and Londiani detectives were on their trail, netting them at the location and recovering the motor vehicle. Kinoti stated that as they undergo legal procedures pending arraignment, more investigations are ongoing to establish any links to a possible larger ring involved in the felony.
