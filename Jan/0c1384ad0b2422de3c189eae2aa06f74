Police have launched a manhunt for a suspected killer mother who stabbed her two kids at Kianjogu village in Kahuro killing one instantly. Nancy Munjiro 21, turned the killer knife against her babies at their grandmother's house. DCI Director George Kinoti said on Monday that Munjiro is a single mother of two; a four-year-old and a two-year-old. Kinoti said the two-year-old died on the spot adding that the older one was rushed to Muriranjas hospital before being referred to Murang'a County hospital in serious condition. "What the kids' grandmother hoped would be a precious bonding moment between mother and sons as she stepped out of her house in the morning, turned to be the darkest day of her life," Kinoti said. "She only came back to find her house turned into a murder scene, her grandchildren soaked in blood and sprawled on the floor." Munjiro, who works as a house help in the Kiriaini area of Kahuro, had visited her mother over the festive season and was yet to report back to her place of work for unknown reasons. Police who visited the scene also found a rope hanging from the roof, suspecting that the accused might have attempted suicide before taking flight.
