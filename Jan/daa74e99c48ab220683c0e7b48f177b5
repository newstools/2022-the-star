Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has convened a three-day special sitting to debate the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021. In a gazette notice dated January 20, Lusaka said the sittings will begin on January 25 to January 27, 2022. "Notice is given to all senators that pursuant to Standing Order 30 (1) of the Senate Standing Orders, on the request of the Senate Majority Leader, with support of the requisite number of senators, I have appointed Tuesday, 25th January 2022, Wednesday, 26th January 2022 and Thursday, 27th January 2022 as days for special sittings of the Senate," the notice reads. "The sittings shall be held at the Senate Chamber, main Parliament buildings, Nairobi." Key among the business that will be transacted at the sittings shall be, among others, the consideration of the Political Parties (Amendment) Bill; and the Heritage and Museums Bill. The County Governments (Amendment) Bill, the Intergovernmental Relations (Amendment) Bill and the County Oversight and Accountability Bill will also be debated. The special sitting comes after the Senate invited members of the public to submit their views on the controversial Coalition Political Party. The Political Parties (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced for first reading on January 11, and immediately committed to the House Justice and Legal Affairs Committee by Speaker Kenneth Lusaka to conduct public participation. The public had until Wednesday, 5 pm, January 19, 2022, to submit their views. The Bill, which seeks to create coalition political parties, was passed by the National Assembly in chaotic and violent sittings earlier in the month. Uhuru and Raila allies clashed with those of Deputy President William Ruto as they fought for the proposed law. While Uhuru and Raila troops supported the Bill, the DP’s allies frustrated the passage and employed several tactics including sponsoring several amendments, in an apparent effort to derail the exercise.
