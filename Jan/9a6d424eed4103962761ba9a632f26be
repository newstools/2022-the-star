LinkedIn has announced that it will shut down the lite version of its application. A lighter version of an application is designed for users in regions with more restricted connectivity and data provisions. It is also designed to load faster, while also using less data, handy for regions with more restrictive data plans. LinkedIn says that it feels confident that it can move on without the scaled-back version which will boost in-app engagement and usage across the app. And that global connectivity is evolving, they do not want to be left behind. This move has seen the removal of the application in android app stores on 27th January, as they plan to deactivate the app come March 15, 2022. “Over the next few weeks, we will focus on helping our members make a smooth transition to our full version app or mobile web experience, whichever best suits their needs,” they said in a statement.
