A witness in a graft case against former Kenya Power and Lighting Company officials yesterday told a court the more than 800 faulty transformers at the Coast region cannot be blamed on supplier. The witness however did not say who is to blamed for the faulty transformers. Ex-Kenya Power Coast regional manager Hezekiah Mwalwala on Tuesday told an anti-corruption court cited a report on transformer failure for 2010 to 2018 in the Coast region which he produced in court as part of the evidence being relied on in the Sh400 million graft case facing former Kenya Power boss Ben Chumo and others. The report did not indicate how old the transformers were, the supplier or the manufacturer. This information was captured in the report which was retrieved from their transformer failure database. The report, the witness said, indicates that some of the defects relate to internal defects. The internal defects in the identified transformers were replaced and tree cutting done. Part of the problem was the cut surrounding the area. The witness told the court he had no role in procurement and could not give any evidence on how any of the transformers were procured. In the case, Chumo and his co-accused were charged with conspiring to commit an economic crime on diverse dates between August 3, 2013 and June 12, 2018 when they procured Sh408.5 billion transformers from M/s Muwa Trading company. Others charged are former managing director Ken Tarus, Beatrice Meso, K.P. Mungai, Joshua Mutua, Abubakar Swaleh, Samuel Ndirangu, and directors of Muwa trading company, James Mungai, Grace Mungai and John Mungai. The charges include conspiracy to commit an offence, aiding the commission of a felony, willful failure to comply with procurement laws, conspiracy to defeat justice and fraudulent acquisition of public property. Muwa supplied KPLC with 501 transformers as at May 22, 2015. Some 327 failed on installation and had to be repaired. Edited by Kiilu Damaris
