Sauti Sol's Polycarp Otieno and media personality Adelle Onyango have raised concerns about celebrities joining politics in 2022. Through their social media platforms, the two said they are concerned that the ones in Parliament haven't done much for creatives. Polycarp said, "Looks like every entertainer/celebrity in this country is vying for a spot in the new government. Is a political seat the ultimate throne? Or do they have our best interest at heart?" On the other hand, Adelle said it is okay but it is strange as she has not seen any of them present a manifesto that details any strategy for the creative economy. "Just using the new political PR buzzwords 'help the youths', ok but how?" Celebrities eyeing political office include Jamali Gaddafi, Rufftone, Jalang’o, MC Jessy and DNG.
