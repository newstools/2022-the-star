Many Nairobians eat on a budget and they mostly depend on food kiosks for lunch meals because they are pocket friendly. Due to the hardship brought by the economy and as people continue search for employment, some decided to venture into fast selling and available foods resulting to the street food culture. Nairobi being the capital city is a fusion of different tribes and cultures and street food is becoming increasingly popular. A spot check by the Star has revealed that different types of street foods are sold at different times of the day. Early in the morning especially within the Central Business District, one can easily spot food vendors pushing trolleys filled with food, or just parked at a certain spot. Some are busy chopping tomatoes and onions as accompaniments for the specific foods they are selling. From as low as Sh30 boiled arrow roots, sweet potatoes and cassava are the favourites for the early morning birds. Other street foods found from evening hours include grilled maize, smokies, boiled eggs, shawarma, viazi karai, chapatis, mandazi, mutura and many more. Edited by B. Oruta
