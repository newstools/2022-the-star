Kenyan Premier League club Wazito have announced the departure of head coach Francis Kimanzi. The decision to part ways with Kimanzi was made official in a terse statement posted on the club's Twitter account. It came barely hours after the former Harambee Stars coach lashed out at the Moneybags for failing to settle his dues on time. “We confirm head coach Francis Kimanzi, his assistants Jeff Odongo and John Kamau, and goalkeepers’ coach Samuel Koko have left the club. We wish them well in their future endeavours," the statement read. “Youth team head coach Fred Ambani assumes first team's duties in the interim with immediate effect." Ambani will work alongside Salim Babu and Elisha Otieno as his assistants. Wazito have been unimpressive this season, posting only two wins from 11 matches thus far. The torrid run has left them in a precarious 16th on the log where they sit with nine points. Kimanzi is the sixth coach to be axed by the club after Briton Stewart Hall, Stanley Okumbi, Fred Ouna, Hamisi Abdalla and Egyptian- American Melis Medo.
