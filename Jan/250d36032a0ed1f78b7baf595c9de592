Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has said that the biggest problem with Kenya is its leadership. Speaking on Vybez Radio, Tuesday, Kabogo said Kenya has many politicians and not leaders. "We only think about the next election and we compete to get into office to eat," he said. The Tujibebe Wakenya Party leader blamed current leaders of going around the country and making false promises which they don't intend to keep at all. He said MPs can make changes in parliament if they are serious about the change, and the development they promise the people. Kabogo however, noted that the current crop of leaders only pass laws that benefit them, which is why you will never hear MPs touch on CDF. The former governor said the reason he started his own party was to work towards changing this and he wanted to go for the country's top seat in the August 9 General Elections but he was told to wait. "I felt ready to lead Kenya and I have the capacity," he said. Kabogo noted that his party is currently in talks with the One Kenya Alliance to see if they can offer a third force in this year's presidential election. Reacting to Meru Senator Mithika Linturi 'madoadoa' remarks, Kabogo said such utterances will take the country back to the 2007-2008 post election violence where more than 1,400 lives were lost. He said Kenyans have the power to stop leaders from making such claims, and they should exercise them. "I can ask our brothers and sisters in Kenya, lets deny these people platforms. Kenyans must remember at the end of the day they are the bosses," Kabogo said.
