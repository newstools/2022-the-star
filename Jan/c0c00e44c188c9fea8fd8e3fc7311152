Vera Sidika says her ex-boyfriend, Otile Brown, is welcome to visit her daughter, Asia Brown. Sidika said this while responding to a fan who asked if she was cool with Otile. "I don't hold grudges, so, he is welcome to visit if he wants to," she said. "He's not friends with Baba Asia (Brown Mauzo) but they've once met a long time ago, work environment." Sidika and Brown broke up in 2018, and Sidika cited finances. “As much as we love so deep, women do find it a turn-off when a man keeps asking for money. From week two of dating, claiming he will refund, and he never did," she said. "When I said I didn’t have 500k, he went mute for one week, and the next time I saw him, he was claiming that relationship ain’t working."
